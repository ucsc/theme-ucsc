He says his years at UCSC were some of the most transformative in his life. Now, as an alumnus settled in the Pacific Northwest, Dodge continues to support his Banana Slug community through gifts to McHenry Library and Stevenson College.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His gifts, which support students in multiple areas, stem from his commitment to public service as a U.S. Air Force Veteran and an avid volunteer in his community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Dodge and his wife established the Robert Dodge Student Service Award, supporting Stevenson College students who partner with community organizations and actively participate in service projects.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I got so much from Stevenson, and I felt that I needed to give back and make sure that others had the opportunities I had,&#8221; Dodge said. &#8220;Because when I went to school, it was pretty easy to get through since the cost wasn&#8217;t nearly as much as it is now.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dodge added that his desire to support students through the Robert Dodge Student Service Award stems from his own career and volunteering roles in public service.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before attending UCSC, he spent two years volunteering at the Burlingame Public Library and worked in the Santa Cruz City Library when he moved to the area. While a student, he worked in McHenry Library, attaching Library of Congress tags to the spine of books before construction on the library was completed in 1965.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after graduating from UCSC in 1969, Dodge continued to pursue opportunities to serve in his community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dodge dedicated 27 years to the Oregon Department of Family Services, showcasing a lasting dedication to social services. He retired from the State of Oregon after nearly three decades of service. Bob continued his involvement in library initiatives, serving as the treasurer of the Foundation of the McMinnville Public Library, was on the board of the Linfield Chamber Orchestra, and served on the city budget committee for several years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the Robert Dodge Student Service Award, Dodge and his wife have made several gifts to McHenry Library in the hopes that the funds will assist in resource expansion.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Attending UCSC in its earliest days&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dodge transferred to UCSC in 1965 from San Mateo Community College. Before college, he spent 3.5 years in the U.S. Air Force. He emphasized that attending UCSC in its beginning years was incredible.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Attending UCSC was a great experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hated to leave. I just remember really enjoying it. UCSC was a major thing in my life, and especially in the first year, it was really interesting.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dodge recalls living in trailers in his first year while construction resumed at the nearby colleges. Because of his experience with the Air Force, he felt at home in the temporary residential units and helped his new roommates adjust. In addition to the trailers, Dodge and his classmates found themselves adjusting to a couple of things unique to UCSC, including the quarter system and not receiving grades on their assignments.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Getting used to classes being pass/fail was difficult,&#8221; Dodge recalled. &#8220;My friends and I really had some issues in dealing with that in the beginning because we would get papers back, and we were trying to interpret them as to what kind of grade that might be. It took a while to get past that.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the initial uncertainty, Bob cherishes the small class sizes and the camaraderie with fellow students. One amusing memory involves a political theory professor, Ray Nichols. The class began with a complex discussion on political theory and higher mathematical principles, which bewildered Bob and his fellow majors. However, to their surprise, the second class revealed a significant reduction in participants, and the intricate topics were never revisited.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I went to office hours to talk about one of my essays, and I said, &#8216;you know, I didn&#8217;t understand what was going on in the first class.&#8217; He just laughed and said, &#8216;you weren&#8217;t supposed to, that was just to drive all those other people out.&#8217;&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, he highlights the influence of Professor Bruce Larkins, who taught Chinese political theory and philosophy, leaving a lasting impression.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dodge&#8217;s enduring commitment to public service and support for his Banana Slug community through gifts to McHenry Library and Stevenson College is a testament to the transformative impact of his UCSC years, emphasizing the importance of giving back to ensure others have the opportunities he enjoyed.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ea844e24807270467a8dd666aed0f018"><name>search-launch-avc-business-analysis-planning</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Search launches for new AVC for budget analysis and planning</title><start-date>1704787200000</start-date><display-name>Search launches for new AVC for budget analysis and planning</display-name><path>/2024/01/search-launch-avc-business-analysis-planning</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/01/search-launch-avc-business-analysis-planning</link><created-by>sgmessic</created-by><created-on>1704741588484</created-on><last-modified-by>sgmessic</last-modified-by><last-modified>1704741717504</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is launching a national search for the position of associate vice chancellor (AVC) for budget analysis and planning.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in Southern California, the daughter of two Iranian immigrant parents, Farnaz Fatemi (Porter, &#8217;91, American studies) didn't necessarily feel connected to her heritage. It wasn't until she attended UC Santa Cruz as an undergraduate student, taking courses in women's studies and ethnic literature, that she started to engage more deeply with her Iranian American identity&#8212;simultaneously developing a passion for poetry that would launch a successful career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatemi recalls that, during her early teens, anti-Iranian sentiment was strong in the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Both my (twin) sister and I were ashamed of being Iranian,&#8221; Fatemi recalled. &#8220;We started calling ourselves Persian without admitting that change to each other. I buried that part of me.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years later, an assignment for an ethnic literature class at UCSC would become pivotal for Fatemi in reclaiming her heritage. While reading a collection of poetry titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emplumada</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Lorna Dee Cervantes that focuses on the author&#8217;s life in San Jose navigating her Chicana identity, Fatemi says she felt a connection to the attention Cervantes paid to the worlds she came from.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I needed those poems right then,&#8221; Fatemi said. &#8220;I really responded to the inquiry and the nuance Cervantes modeled as a poet,&#8221; Fatemi said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She met other Iranian students at UCSC, connecting more to her ethnic identity, and started writing poetry as an outlet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her twin sister, Tara Fatemi Walker (Porter &#8217;91), also attended UCSC at the time and was majoring in creative writing. Through her sister, Fatemi had access to open mics and poets. &#8220;I started writing my own poetry and started doing open mics,&#8221; she said. She met local poets who further nurtured her passion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following graduation from UCSC, she committed to making poetry central to her life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I still felt apprehensive about speaking as an Iranian American in my writing,&#8221; Fatemi said. &#8220;I worried about representing a group of people. It made me sort of mute. I had to be patient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After pursuing an MFA in poetry from Mills College, Fatemi returned to UC Santa Cruz to teach. She was a writing instructor at UCSC for 21 years, and continues to teach summer session courses for transfer students. From 1999-2004 she taught a Writing 1 course focused on reading and writing about the Middle East.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love teaching at UCSC because of my own transformative time as an undergraduate here. It has always been a privilege to be part of students&#8217; academic transitions&#8211;whether first year students in my writing courses or students transferring to UCSC after their time at community colleges.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022 she published her debut book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sister Tongue</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emplumada</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the collection of poetry that jump-started Fatemi's writing, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sister Tongue</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> utilizes the two languages that have helped shape her identity&#8212;English and Farsi&#8212;to explore issues of selfhood, gender, nationality, voice, and family. Moving back and forth between traditionally structured poems and lyrical prose, Fatemi offers her readers both individual moments and an ongoing conversation between&#160; her American and Iranian inheritances.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have been obsessed with issues of culture, place, language, and borders, including those inside and between people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I realized that these themes&#8211;borders, language, culture, and boundaries&#8211;shape the way I think about my own self and translate the world at large.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sister Tongue </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">won the 2021 Stan and Tom Wick Poetry Prize, selected by Tracy K. Smith, from Kent State University Press, and received a Starred Review from Publisher&#8217;s Weekly. She is the recipient of a $50,000 Laureate Fellowship from the Academy of American Poets and an Artist Fellowship from the California Arts Council. She co-founded the local Hive Poetry Collective, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which presents a weekly radio show and podcast in Santa Cruz County and hosts readings and poetry-related events.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fatemi is also a recipient of an Arts Council Santa Cruz County Develop Grant.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Santa Cruz County&#8217;s Poet Laureate</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatemi&#8217;s most recent accomplishment is her position as Santa Cruz County&#8217;s Poet Laureate for 2023 and 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I heard before becoming poet laureate that people wanted more opportunities for young writers and poets. I thought one thing I could do is create a youth poet laureate program and connect with schools and libraries that want to create more spaces for young writers.&#8221; She is using the fellowship from the Academy of American Poets to augment youth poetry offerings and host a series of pop-up teen poetry workshops in Santa Cruz County.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatemi said she is excited to partner with organizations that work with youth for her pop-up workshop program. Her project, &#8220;Our Place,&#8221; is focused on providing poetry outlets for teenage writers concerned with climate change and the environment. So far, she has connected with several individual teachers across the county, along with groups like Watsonville Wetlands Watch Climate Leadership Institute and Santa Cruz Natural History Museum&#8217;s nature club for middle schoolers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her youth poet laureate programs have included three writing workshops as well as classes on resume writing, oral performance, and how to put a poetry portfolio together for students interested in submitting their work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatemi said that teenagers are the key demographic she hopes to reach. She noted that while Santa Cruz County has rich and diverse literary communities for adults, there are not many formal writing communities for younger people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When you get an opportunity to write in your early years it sticks. Finding ways to be creative can help process the intensity of the world at that age,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatemi reiterates that she learned the importance of community at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It has always felt that the only way to sustain good work is to do it with other people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My mentors at UCSC, specifically Marge Frantz, were a model of the power of engaging others in your efforts to make the world a more equitable and fulfilling place. She helped me see that you can do something that is hard and that you believe in better when you do that in community with others.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study was organized and led by Colorado State University (CSU) and published in </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2309881120"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The findings quantify the impact of extreme short-term drought on grassland and shrubland ecosystems across six continents with a level of detail that was not previously possible. It is the first time an experiment this extensive has been undertaken to generate a baseline understanding of the potential losses of plant productivity in these vital ecosystems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melinda Smith, a professor in the Department of Biology at CSU, led the study and is the first&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">author on the paper. Michael Loik, professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz, is a co-author on the paper, a member of the steering committee that designed the experiment, and the lead scientist for three study sites at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known as the International Drought Experiment, the research originally dates back to 2013, as part of the National Science Foundation&#8217;s Drought-Net Research Coordination Network. Altogether, there are more than 170 authors representing institutions from around the world cited in the new PNAS study, which was completed over the last four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To gather their data, researchers built rainfall manipulation structures to experimentally reduce the amount of naturally occurring precipitation available to ecosystems for at least a full growing season. At UC Santa Cruz, rainfall structures were installed at the Coastal Science Campus, near the UCSC Arboretum and Botanical Gardens, and on UCSC Natural Reserve lands on upper campus. About half of the experiment&#8217;s participating sites imposed extreme drought conditions with these structures, while the rest imposed less severe drought for comparison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loik said a crucial component of the experiment&#8217;s plan was designing the standardized rainfall manipulation structures to be relatively small and easy and inexpensive to build, so that more researchers around the world could participate without concerns about financial capacity. As a result, the team was ultimately able to collect and analyze data from 100 sites.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results showed that, for a single year of simulated drought, loss of aboveground plant growth&#8212;a key measure of ecosystem function and an important carbon cycle process&#8212;was 60% greater at experimental sites that experienced extreme once-in-a-century drought conditions, compared to those where less severe drought conditions were imposed. These findings greatly exceeded previously reported losses for grasslands and shrublands.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Past studies suffered from methodological differences when estimating the impacts of&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extreme drought in natural ecosystems, but our standardized, distributed approach here&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">addressed that problem,&#8221; Smith said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Findings from the sites also provide insight into how specific climates, soil, and vegetation types&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">broadly influence drought response. While the work shows that drier and less diverse sites are likely to be the most vulnerable to extremes, the severity of the drought was the most consistent and important factor in determining an ecosystem&#8217;s response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loik said studies such as this one, that identify how sensitive plants in different ecosystems are to drought, can be useful on many fronts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The results should help to project drought impacts at regional and continental scales,&#8221; Loik said. &#8220;This knowledge can help land planners, wildland fire personnel, and natural resource managers who need to know how and when to intervene in a future climate that has much more variable precipitation patterns.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is now examining data collected from the full four years of the project for the next phase of their research: assessing multi-year drought impacts globally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are hundreds of in-person and online courses available, from foundational courses in math and science, including the popular </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organic Chemistry</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series, to hands-on classes like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Improvisation, Creative Writing,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Metal Fabrication. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students can build their resumes with opportunities like service learning and internships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking just one summer session course can put students on track to graduate on time or leave room in their schedule for a valuable internship or study abroad experience. Summer benefits </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to make the optional fourth quarter an excellent time for students to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earn credit toward their degrees and explore unique learning opportunities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whether students use classes to graduate in three years, double major, or complete a prerequisite in just five weeks, there are so many options,&#8221; said Jennifer Gallacher, interim director of Summer Session. &#8220;Our in-person classes allow students to focus on fewer courses and be part of the unique summer community, or we have a range of online synchronous and asynchronous courses that still allow them to meet their academic goals from anywhere.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>

Murray, an esteemed interdisciplinary scholar with a passion for mentorship, will bring a unique perspective to her new role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"As a talented and collaborative leader, Soraya will serve as a champion for the Porter College community," said Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education and Global Engagement Richard Hughey. "She is someone who will put our students first, individually and collectively, and will help them build meaningful connections to thrive as undergraduates and beyond."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murray, a faculty member in the Film and Digital Media Department at UC Santa Cruz since 2010, has focused her research on visual culture, contemporary art, film, and video games. Her extensive portfolio includes numerous published essays and writings anthologized nationally and internationally. Murray authored </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Video Games: The Visual Politics of Race, Gender and Space</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (I.B. Tauris, 2018) and is currently co-editing an anthology on antiracist futures in games and play. She is also writing a book on anxiety films about technology from the 1970s to the present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an accomplished educator, Murray brings a depth of experience to the role and a commitment to supporting students' academic journeys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As an undergraduate, I had mentors who became beacons of achievement,&#8221; said Murray. &#8220;These were professors and administrators whom I greatly admired and who inspired me to strive. I am most excited about being that mentor now and pointing the way for the next generation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murray's vision for Porter College centers on enhancing students' sense of community, belonging, and activation. She aims to empower all students to navigate the academic landscape with confidence and develop skills that are directly applicable to their future professions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Porter&#8217;s vision centers on the arts, but really, it is all about the essential value of creative inquiry as a key tool for building a better life and a more equitable future,&#8221; Murray stated. &#8220;The larger goals for me are about readying students for professions of their choosing, helping them to face the challenges that will surely come with dignity, and challenging them to be capable and morally courageous in their ideas. This is in keeping with the ethos of Porter: Learn how to learn. Learn by doing. Let your learning make a difference.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter College, founded in 1969, has a mission to foster achievement in all areas of study, with a special dedication to achievement in the arts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murray will succeed Sean Keilen, who has provided invaluable leadership at Porter College for the last decade and will continue in his position as Chair of the Council of Provosts and Professor of Literature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In accepting her new role, Murray acknowledged the strong foundation laid by Sean Keilen and other college staff and faculty, stating, &#8220;Porter College has established an esteemed reputation, and I hope to build on the already strong efforts and innovations of those who came before me. I am honored to be a steward of the college and take that responsibility very seriously."</span></p>

<p><strong>About Porter College</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter College was founded in 1969 as the fifth of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s residential colleges and was later renamed in honor of a generous grant from the Porter-Sesnon family. Its mission is to foster achievement in all areas of study. Porter is especially dedicated to achievement in the arts, believing that creative inquiry is an essential part of a rigorous and broad-minded education, a flourishing society, and a happy life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Porter College curriculum encourages students to explore unusual topics and provocative ideas, to test and revise hypotheses about the meaning of their experiences, to learn from the failures that are an inevitable part of new learning and discovery, and to assume responsibility for the decisions they make in their studies. In addition to Core courses for first-year students, which provide rigorous training in critical reading and writing and study skills, Porter offers a variety of smaller interdisciplinary seminars that combine historical and theoretical approaches to the arts, humanities, and sciences with practical experience conducting scholarly research and making creative work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter College fellows hail from every academic division on campus and from many non-academic professions, but all of them share the philosophy of education that the College&#8217;s curriculum embodies: first, discover how to learn; then, learn by doing; and finally, let your learning make a difference in the world.&#160;</span></p>

Grabe, a Professor of Social Psychology at UC Santa Cruz, brings a depth of experience in research, activism, and interdisciplinary collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Colleges, College Provosts, and the Council of Provosts, are critical in shaping the academic experience for our students," said Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education and Global Engagement Richard Hughey. "Shelly Grabe is a proven student advocate and collaborative leader. Her extensive research and expertise will bring an intersectional lens into the sustainability programs and foci of Rachel Carson College.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A distinguished scholar-activist with a focus on structural inequities, Grabe began teaching at UC Santa Cruz in 2008. Her accolades include the Denmark-Reuder Award for Outstanding International Contributions to Psychology in 2015, and she has authored several books, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narrating the Psychology of Resistance: Voices of the Compa&#241;eras in Nicaragua</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Oxford University Press, 2016) and co-authored </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voces de Mujeres Feministas Agentes de Cambio en Per&#250; (Voices of Feminist Women Agents of Change in Peru) </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Kimochi Soluciones Editoriales, 2023).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grabe's decision to assume the role of Rachel Carson College Provost is driven by her passion for sustainability and social justice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"My past research is in social movements, and I am particularly interested in the potential to grow an aspect of environmental justice at Rachel Carson," said Grabe. "I hope to incorporate programming that recognizes the experience of marginalization and how turning to marginalized sources of knowledge may actually help our efforts towards sustainability."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grabe emphasized the need to incorporate an intersectional lens into sustainability efforts, integrating perspectives on gender equity, indigenous knowledge, and environmental justice. She envisions Rachel Carson College as a hub for inclusive sustainability, building on existing campus initiatives such as the People of Color Sustainability Collective and partnerships with the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting on the strengths of the colleges at UC Santa Cruz, Grabe noted the commitment to creating a living learning environment. She aims to add an activism angle related to environmental justice, fostering not just individual sustainable practices but also the structural and social change necessary for large scale sustainability goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 16 years of teaching experience at UC Santa Cruz, including a year and a half working as an interim and associate provost at Cowell College, Grabe is enthusiastic about her new role. She values the collegial atmosphere among the provosts and sees her administrative position as an extension of her commitment to enhancing the student experience at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"My commitment to the substance of these topics and the student experience is very similar to the dedication I've had as a faculty member who's teaching or engaging in social science research," said Grabe. "I see this as another venue for continuing that commitment."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 1972, Rachel Carson College has been integral to UCSC's environmental, ecological, and sustainability programs. RCC has ambitious curricular initiatives to engage students in sustainability research and work, including a College Core Course on "Environment and Society" and a minor in Sustainability Studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grabe will succeed Sue Carter as RCC Provost, who served 2 commendable 3-year terms.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In acknowledging the contributions of former RCC college provosts and staff, Hughey affirmed, "I am grateful for the strong foundation that has been built at Rachel Carson College. I know that Dr. Grabe will build on that legacy and further enhance the college's impact on sustainability and social justice."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grabe expressed her enthusiasm for the opportunities ahead, stating, "I am honored to join the Rachel Carson community and am excited to contribute to the college's ongoing success."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those classes helped her forge a career path that would let her delve deeply into the past and share this fascination with other people. These days she&#8217;s working as an interpretive guide at two museums in Massachusetts, where she&#8217;s focusing on the American Revolutionary War while getting ready to start graduate school next fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#8220;I really enjoy getting to share my love of history and hearing what excites visitors,&#8221; said Michaels, who leads tours at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lexington Historical Society and the Concord Museum near the site of the first battles in the American Revolutionary War.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The American Revolution wasn&#8217;t a topic I studied in college,&#8221; Michaels said. &#8220;But my history classes gave me the ability to learn a lot about a topic quickly and share what I&#8217;ve learned in a meaningful way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Michaels has started assisting the director of interpretation and education at the Lexington Historical Society, helping out with administrative tasks. &#8220;I have been enjoying learning about what another position in the museum field looks like as I begin to think about what I would like to do next,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next fall, Michaels will start a masters program in disability studies at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">School Of Global Inclusion &amp; Social Development at the University of Massachusetts Boston. This program examines global, national, and local issues related to inclusion and social development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students seek solutions to complex challenges in today&#8217;s rapidly changing society, such as health disparities, environmental justice, community development, participatory decision-making, and economic inequality, as well as discrimination based on gender, disability, sexual orientation, age, race, ethnicity, and economic status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#8220;This program will train me to help even more people develop a love for history,&#8221; Michael said.</span></p>
<p><strong>Forging a career path at UC Santa Cruz</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the winter of 2021, Michaels took continuing lecturer in History Bruce Thompson&#8217;s exit seminar on modern Irish history, where she first learned about the Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence. The course lit a spark for her. She learned to let her curiosity guide the way.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Much of the history of the Irish revolutionary period is focused on the men involved, such as James Connolly and Michael Collins,&#8221; Michaels said. &#8220;Countess Constance Georgine Markievicz is the only woman who is frequently mentioned in regard to revolutionary activity. This is understandable because she was a founding member of the women&#8217;s republican revolutionary group, the Cumann na mBan, and was arrested for her involvement in the Rising.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But &#8211; as Michaels discovered while taking this class &#8211; Markievicz was far from the only woman involved in the fight for Irish independence.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her final paper for the seminar, Michaels dug more deeply into the role of women during the Easter Rising, delving into books such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women of the Irish Revolution</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Liz Gillis and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renegades: Irish Republican Women</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">1900-22 </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Ann Matthews.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also made use of online sources such as the Women's Museum of Ireland&#8217;s website. Her online research led to fresh insights about the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cumann na mBan work during the mid and late 1900s.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The whole History department was so supportive of me, and I would not be where I am today without all of them,&#8221; said Michaels, who expressed her gratitude to Thompson,&#160;<span>History Department undergraduate advisor&#160;</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie Sawyer, Associate History Professor, Cowell College Provost and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Co-Director of the Center for the Study of Pacific War Memories at UC Santa Cruz Alan Chisty, Associate Professor of History Elaine Sullivan, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neufeld-Levin Chair of Holocaust Studies, Associate Professor of History</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Alma Heckman, and continuing lecturer in History Edward Kehler.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also during her time at UC Santa Cruz, Michaels immersed herself in public history, serving as the student leader of the archival and oral history teams for the </span><a href="https://okinawamemories.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okinawa Memories Initiative (OMI)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Formerly the Gail Project, the initiative is designed to help undergraduate and graduate researchers gain valuable out-of-classroom experience from professionals while advocating Okinawan history.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;OMI was the perfect opportunity to explore Japanese history outside of the classroom,&#8221; Michaels said. &#8220;OMI allowed me to study history and learn skills that I did not get from regular history courses, such as conducting interviews and video editing. By leading two teams, I also gained important leadership skills that have been and will continue to be incredibly useful in my professional life.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f95ac6fc80727046333851b1112252b4"><name>fieldwork-harassment-research</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Training program helps prevent harassment in fieldwork environments</title><summary>Fieldwork often puts researchers and students in remote environments that have unique challenges.

The unusual setting of fieldwork can make sexual harassment and assault more likely, and it also calls for distinct approaches to prevent and respond to it. To address this systemic problem, University of Santa Cruz scientists developed a sexual harassment prevention and awareness training program specifically tailored to fieldwork environments.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49203-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific Reports paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the researchers assessed the impacts of the workshop by surveying hundreds of California Department of Fish and Wildlife employees before and after they participated in the training. The training focuses heavily on prevention rather than reporting incidents after the fact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We really want to prevent incidents before they happen,&#8221; said Melissa Cronin, a marine fisheries ecologist at Duke University who co-designed the workshop while doing her PhD at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;And we do this by using tools from the literature that help people build positive environments where the norm is such that you don&#8217;t let harassment happen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team drew from social psychology studies to design an in-person workshop that involves group discussions and scenario-based problem-solving. The training started at UC Santa Cruz as a program called Building a Better Fieldwork Future in 2018. After a pilot study, Cronin and the team worked with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers trained a small group of CDFW staff to become instructors, and those instructors then delivered 90-minute trainings to 925 CDFW field scientists in 2022. They conducted the trainings in batches to create control groups, and participants voluntarily completed confidential surveys before and after the trainings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team found that the trainings worked similarly well for people of different genders and racial groups. In general, the trainings increased employees&#8217; knowledge of the issue and their feelings that they can prevent and intervene in harassment incidents.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group also found that the impact of the training lasted longer than expected.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We had hypothesized that the effects of participating in the just 90-minute training might be short-lived,&#8221; said Erika Zavaleta, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz who helped design the trainings. &#8220;And that&#8217;s not what we found. To a large degree, across all demographic groups, months after the training people still felt and reported an elevated sense of knowledge about this issue, confidence that they could respond and desire to respond &#8212; both in prevention and reporting.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cronin believes the effectiveness of the training comes in part from its interactive design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think that has to do with the fact that the training is live and interactive and that it is tailored to fieldwork,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It involves four separate scenarios where people have to interact with the content in small groups and then in large groups, and they have to actually engage. There&#8217;s not really any way out of it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another result of the surveys showed that women and people from underrepresented minority identities scored their knowledge and ability to confidently intervene as lower than men and white people in both pre and post surveys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One explanation for that is that women and people of color either underestimate their own abilities, or perhaps the opposite &#8212; that white people and men overestimate their ability to prevent harassment in fieldwork,&#8221; said Cronin. &#8220;People who have very little experience with a problem might think, &#8216;Well this is very easy to respond to,&#8217;&#8230; while women and people of color, who are statistically more likely to experience harassment, perhaps know that this is a really difficult issue.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new paper provides the first data-based study of a fieldwork training program that addresses sexual harassment and assault.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the first training for which we have concrete evidence that it works,&#8221; said Cronin, adding that the researchers will continue testing what works and what does not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team plans to continue refining and building the training workshop, and in November of 2022, Cronin and Zavaleta co-founded FieldFutures, a company that offers the fieldwork-tailored training to institutions and government agencies. They offer the 90-minute trainings as well as more intensive four-hour trainings and have been impressed by the interest.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No one should be excluded from field science by sexual harassment and assault,&#8221; said Zavaleta, who emphasized that enabling everyone to do fieldwork safely also has broader impacts for science and society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They include things like addressing threats to biodiversity and tackling climate change,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This work is really connected to solving these other big challenges in addition to equity.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>

Goldberg reflects on advocacy journey from UCSC to teacher’s union president 
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David B. Goldberg was never late to Professor Dana Frank&#8217;s labor studies class.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three days a week, promptly at 8 a.m., Professor Frank closed the doors to her lecture hall. The expectation was that if the working class could wake up to get to work before the sun rose, her students, privileged enough to attend college, should be able to reach class on time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldberg </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Oakes &#8217;94, community studies) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">took great interest in the power of organizing on behalf of the working class while he was a student at UC Santa Cruz and in her class.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When speaking with Professor Frank about his desire to become a union organizer, she told him, &#8220;Become a worker first.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that&#8217;s what Goldberg did, following in his mother&#8217;s and grandmother&#8217;s footsteps. Both were educators and strike captains for United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA). In 1971, when it was illegal for teachers to strike, Goldberg&#8217;s grandmother walked the lines to protect teacher&#8217;s rights. His mom walked the line in 1989. Thirty years later, he did the same.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Goldberg serves as President of the California Teachers Association (CTA) which represents 310,000 educators in the state.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldberg didn&#8217;t always know what he wanted to do. He came to UCSC wanting a break from his competitive streak as a basketball player. Division III ball was the perfect median. Coming from Los Angeles&#8217;s Fairfax High School filled with the hustle and bustle of city life, Santa Cruz&#8217;s tall trees and tranquility enchanted him.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I remember running around the track and thinking, &#8216;Oh my god, is this for real?&#8217; And then all of a sudden, you&#8217;re looking over the ocean,&#8221; Goldberg said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the trees, Goldberg found solace in his major, community studies. His first stint at educating came through working at the Ark Independent Studies school as fieldwork for his major.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ark was a continuation school for students who left comprehensive school for various reasons. The teacher Goldberg worked with spent a lot of time with her students, developing different ways to engage their learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was beautiful to see what it meant for a teacher to lay everything on the line and be connected with her students and have both be accountable to one another,&#8221; Goldberg said. &#8220;In the community studies department, we spent a lot of time doing work and looking at the theory and practice of how those relate to each other.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldberg found a community on campus called Concerned Students, where he could practice what his professors preached. He was part of a student-led protest that advocated for freezing fee hikes and other student-centered demands. A confrontation with campus police during a takeover of McHenry Library resulted in Goldberg&#8217;s arrest. But that didn&#8217;t deter him; organizing is in his blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His father was an outspoken free speech advocate in the &#8217;60s and was expelled from UCLA and UC Berkeley for it. For the past 50 years, his father has served as a community lawyer in Los Angeles.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t come into organizing without pretense. I grew up&#160; going to actions,&#8221; Goldberg said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both organizing and working with teachers, and professors like Dana Frank, pushed Goldberg to find his path into education. As soon as he graduated in 1997, and after a short season of professional overseas basketball, Goldberg decided to pursue his teaching credential.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He started work as a bilingual teacher in Boyle Heights, in Northeast LA.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I came to teaching amid a huge attack on students I was serving. It was during the time of No Child Left Behind, right after Prop 187, an attack on undocumented students. I was a bilingual elementary teacher, and the government had just outlawed bilingual education. I found myself at the frontlines of a lot of bigger struggles.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The path was clear, and just like his mother and grandmother before him, Goldberg began organizing with UTLA. From employee protections to pushing for an anti-racist curriculum for all students, he stands on the frontlines for equitable education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldberg wanted to influence a more widespread change among members of the union and students. His part divulged into more involvement with the union. He went from serving as site leader to becoming union treasurer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldberg didn&#8217;t even know the CTA existed before 2008&#8212;until the recession hit. Teachers and union members were being laid off left and right. Goldberg realized if he wanted to increase protections for teachers at a larger scale and to fight for what his students deserved, he needed statewide support.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldberg has since served on CTA&#8217;s Board of Directors for six years, served as secretary-treasurer for a four-year term, and then served as vice president for another four-year term. Now, Goldberg is serving his first term as president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel blessed that what I chose to spend my life working around is an issue that is great to build movement around and it resonates with people,&#8221; Goldberg said. &#8220;It allows us to put anti-racism, class issues, and social justice issues at the center of our work and help serve our community every day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldberg hopes one day to make a better world for his kids and future generations to enjoy. A world he attributes to his mom, grandmother, father, and wife's work and their consistent love for people.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is a privilege and honor to be in connection with others that serve the community,&#8221; Goldberg said. &#8220;The work we do is to continue to fight for a better world that doesn&#8217;t have so much pain and hurt to begin with.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the frontlines of student advocacy at UCSC to the forefront of teacher&#8217;s rights in the state, Goldberg&#8217;s journey is a testament to the transformative power of passion, purpose, and a profound commitment to creating a better world for generations to come.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="13391558807270465b5904d9fcd42c89"><name>living-writers-series</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Alumni and professor authors return to UCSC</title><summary>Ten alumni authors and two former professors will be featured in the Creative Writing Program’s Living Writers Reading Series in Jan. through March. &#13;

Championing important and diverse perspectives, these authors and their works reflect the excellence and diversity for which we celebrate the Literature Department&#8217;s Creative Writing Program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For over two decades, the Living Writers Reading Series has connected current UCSC students with trailblazing alumni authors through live readings and engaging dialogues. This year, the series invites back 10 recent creative writing alumni and two former professors to talk about their publications and careers after graduating from UCSC. Students and community members are invited to attend lecture presentations from Jan. through March at the </span><a href="https://creativewriting.ucsc.edu/news-events/living-writers-series/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanities Lecture Hall or on Zoom. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">The events are free and open to the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These 12 distinguished authors exemplify the transformative power of our Creative Writing Program,&#8221; said Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder. &#8220;Their impactful contributions to literature serve as a beacon of inspiration for current and future students. Through their words and experiences, they illuminate the limitless possibilities that lie ahead, inspiring a new generation of writers to explore, create, and make their mark on the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Living Writers Reading Series was started by Humanities Associate Dean and Literature Professor Micah Perks and Emerita Professor of Literature Karen Yamashita nearly two decades ago when they were hired the same year. Students in the program are required to attend the readings; as a result, the entire creative writing program comes together five times a quarter, cultivating a growing community space. The Living Writers Lecture Series seeks to introduce current students and the larger UCSC community </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to new writing and the many ways of being a writer in the world by celebrating accomplished authors across a variety of writing mediums.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perks, the organizer of this quarter&#8217;s reading series, emphasizes the importance of these events for building community within the Creative Writing Program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want students to be connected to more ways of being a writer in the world,&#8221; Perks said. &#8220;Maybe the alumni author is a detective novelist or maybe they are an extremely experimental poet. Our trailblazing alumni run the gamut of writing and we want to create a space for our current students to be exposed to all of the possibilities. We want to connect them to the work while creating a space for community within the creative writing program at UCSC.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This quarter, the Living Writers Lecture Series will highlight the work of alumni authors in their careers' early stages and welcomes back two former creative writing professors. Featured alumni will include creative/critical concentration Ph.D. alumni, undergraduate debut novelists, undergraduate poets, and former UCSC professors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This time we're highlighting people who are earlier in their career,&#8221; explains Micah Perks, &#8220; We're trying to do a series that features alumni who the students will feel more connected to because they&#8217;re just a little further on&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

the Mellon Foundation will propel new program focused on experiential learning and career readiness for humanities students</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Humanities Division at UC Santa Cruz has embarked on a transformative journey with a $1 million grant from the Mellon Foundation to launch the groundbreaking <a href="https://humanities.ucsc.edu/employing-humanities/index.html">Employing Humanities</a> initiative. This visionary program aims to redefine humanities education by providing students with unparalleled experiential learning opportunities, bridging the gap between academic studies and real-world applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanities Division Dean Jasmine Alinder, a passionate advocate for humanities-focused education, leads this innovative initiative. With a rich background in experiential learning, Alinder envisions "Employing Humanities" as a link connecting students to meaningful careers and fostering community engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Humanities gives you skills that are durable and flexible, that can really serve a student throughout the arc of their career," Alinder said. "We&#8217;re moving in the direction of making skill-building more explicit, and giving students opportunities to&#160; see clear pathways from classroom to career."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engaging in experiential opportunities offers a multitude of benefits, providing participants with practical skills applicable to their future careers by translating classroom knowledge into real-world scenarios. These experiences contribute to a deeper comprehension of specific job fields and industries, shedding light on their challenges and opportunities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond professional practices and skill sets, these opportunities offer insights into personal expertise, interests, passions, and values. Participants emerge with enhanced self-confidence and leadership skills, along with a strengthened resume, providing a competitive edge as they navigate the job market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mellon Foundation, renowned for its commitment to critical thinking and just communities, acknowledged the potential of the Employing Humanities initiative, proudly awarding a $1 million grant. This substantial investment reflects the foundation's belief in empowering humanities students with the skills necessary for success in a rapidly evolving world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Employing Humanities initiative will revolutionize humanities education by offering undergraduate majors and minors expanded opportunities for service learning, undergraduate research, and paid internships throughout Santa Cruz County and the region. Beyond career preparation, the initiative emphasizes civic engagement and global citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alinder, who joined UC Santa Cruz in August 2020, envisions this initiative as a response to the national decline in humanities-based degrees, positioning humanities studies for long-term success. "To counter this decline, we are outlining a comprehensive plan,&#8221; Alinder said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the upcoming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> three years, the Humanities division will concentrate on five pivotal elements crucial for the initiative's success: expanding infrastructure to support student achievement, devising innovative curricula, diversifying faculty hires, enhancing infrastructure to support faculty research, and fostering a transformative shift in the campus culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlighting the significance of the initiative, Humanities Division Assistant Dean Amy Bruinooge stated, "We are trying to capture the success of humanities-oriented students and build a curriculum centered on career readiness and a well-rounded education."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumna Theresa Bostic, who graduated this past June with a double major in history and sociology and a minor in Black studies, and was awarded an undergraduate award and research fellowship by the </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanities Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, praised the well-rounded humanities education she received at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her freshman year, she enrolled in history courses that helped her to explore the various paths she could take in her educational and professional career. Bostic was also a Humanities Institute Public Fellow and </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/undergrad-profile-theresa-bostic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undergraduate Research Fellow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She also had the opportunity to participate in a </span><a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2023/03/a-journey-through-egypts-past-and-present/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funded trip to Egypt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with 10 other students and two History professors to explore in-person what they had studied together in class. Now, Bostic works as a Project Specialist for UC Berkeley&#8217;s School of Education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bostic attested to the positive impact a humanistic-focused education has had on her career trajectory. &#8220;Studying humanities at UC Santa Cruz helped me prepare for my career by allowing me to think about how I want to contribute to my environment and what my passions are,&#8221; Bostic said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gained important research and discussion skills through my history courses, which I&#8217;ve been able to apply to my job position today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Employing Humanities program has already generated immense student interest. The first eight paid internship opportunities advertised this fall received over 200 applications, showcasing the demand for forward-looking humanities education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mellon Foundation's investment in the Employing Humanities initiative extends its positive impact beyond students, aiming to forge a mutually beneficial relationship between academia and society. By connecting scholars with community organizations through service learning opportunities, the program seeks to enrich both the student experience and the broader community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the initiative aligns with the division's commitment to social justice, introducing cross-disciplinary academic certificates like </span><a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2023/08/when-humanists-met-technologists/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanizing Technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, and </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/10/vast-feature.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visualizing Abolition Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also funded by the Mellon Foundation. These certificates ensure that humanistic training is accessible to students across diverse majors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We believe that training in the humanities is essential for a successful and fulfilling future, both individually and collectively," Dean Alinder said. "We aim to equip our students with the skills to succeed as socially-just leaders in professional, academic, and community-engaged settings."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Employing Humanities initiative unfolds, UC Santa Cruz's Humanities Division faculty, staff, students, and alums are set to prove once again that they excel as both thinkers and doers, contributing to the continued reimagining of the world through the transformative power of humanities education.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="13ace34e807270465b5904d95b7a2c4d"><name>call-for-interdisciplinary-proposals-leading-the-change</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Leading the Change: Call for Interdisciplinary Proposals</title><summary>I write to invite you to apply for the Leading the Change Collaborative Series.

Globally, coastal hazards produce increasing costs, often to the most vulnerable populations.

A new paper from the tool&#8217;s creators outlines the &#8220;game-time&#8221; decisions that the programmers made to keep up with an evolutionary tree of millions of genomic sequences, offering guidance for the future of web tools for tracking pathogen evolution.&#160;<br/><br/>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01622-5">paper</a>, which was recently published in the journal <em>Nature Genetics</em>, aims to serve as a resource for bioinformaticians and public health officials. It lays out the results obtained by the UShER team and especially UCSC Bioinformatics Programmer and &#8220;keeper of the tree&#8221; Angie Hinrichs, showing the biggest and most important innovations along the way.<br/><br/>&#8220;Angie is recognized in the field as one of the major heroes of the pandemic, and rightly so. [The work] is pretty special and really worth documenting, because it probably, hopefully, won&#8217;t happen again,&#8221; said UCSC Associate Professor of Biomolecular Russell Corbett-Detig, who is the paper&#8217;s senior author.&#160;<br/><br/>UShER, which stands for Ultrafast Sample Placement on Existing tRees, is an online tool that takes in genomic sequences of major human pathogens (such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus) that have been sampled in communities around the world and maps them onto an evolutionary tree. The software runs an analysis which places new samples into their correct branches, rather than starting the analysis from over again and re-computing everything each time, which is how other tools function. They call their approach &#8220;online phylogenetics,&#8221; where &#8220;online&#8221; means that the analysis is continually extended to include new information, as opposed to the classical &#8220;offline&#8221; approach of starting over from scratch whenever new information becomes available.&#160;<br/><br/>To date, the massive tree contains more than 15 million sequences, which are interpreted by public health officials to track the spread of strains in their communities.<br/><br/>&#8220;This is a really widely used resource &#8212; people use it hundreds of times daily,&#8221; Corbett-Detig said. &#8220;I think we owed the community an explanation of all the decisions that we had made behind the scenes, because we've just been changing things to make it work for a long time.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>In the earlier days of the pandemic, the research team joked that the diagram of the virus&#8217;s evolution was more of a phylogenetic &#8220;lawn&#8221; than a tree because it was very wide and not very tall, due to the large number of&#160; samples and relatively small number of mutations.&#160;<br/><br/>Now, about four years since the beginning of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, tracking the evolution of the virus looks very different from the early days. Simply put, there are many more samples and many more mutations, the sorting of which slowed down USHER&#8217;s software.&#160;<br/><br/>In the paper, the authors took a detailed look at their server logs to describe problems that arose and the strategies they used to solve them.<br/><br/>Through &#8220;profiling&#8221; UShER, a computer science process for determining the slowest elements of their program, the team was able to find out that it was the algorithm running more &#8220;tree traversals&#8221; than necessary that was slowing down the tree. This analysis, led by co-author UC San Diego Assistant Professor Yatish Turakhia&#8217;s student Cheng Ye, allowed the team to create additional levels of parallelism in the code in order to run the tree over an order of magnitude faster and more efficiently, drastically lowering USHER&#8217;s runtime and solving their largest problem.<br/><br/>These insights helped the team keep up the software that is a crucial piece in the public health response COVID-19, and could inform similar efforts for any future pandemics. Because there is now very cheap access to commercially available sequencing technology nearly everywhere, the major limitations of this work are now mainly on the analysis side rather than the data production side.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;We want to encourage doing [phylogenetics] this way for the next pandemic, or for any pathogen,&#8221; Hinrichs said. &#8220;We believe this can and should be applied to any pathogen as genome sequencing increases &#8212; we should be maintaining a resource where anybody can upload their new genome and instantly see what it's mostly closely related to.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>Going beyond just pandemic-level respiratory viruses, similar software is being developed to track other pathogens such as influenza and tuberculosis. Some of these other pathogens are harder to study than the relatively simple SARS-CoV-2 virus, for which scientists essentially have an ancestral reference point from when the virus first emerged in 2019. Other viruses and bacteria have larger, more complex genomes with more mutations, and so being able to quickly process data will be advantageous for handling these pathogens.&#160;<br/><br/>This paper offers insight into online analysis as a tool that can be used beyond phylogenetics, as biomedical data sets continue to get larger and larger. The team argues that for many data sets it will be more efficient&#160; to do online analyses that do not require analyzing an entire dataset from scratch each time more data is added in, but instead run an&#160; analysis to fit the new data into an established data set and structure.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;I don't want people to think this is a fundamentally solved problem,&#8221; Corbett-Detig said. &#8220;I think that with the bigger idea of online phylogenetics, there's going to be lots and lots of innovation in this field going forward. It's really useful to have us sit down and say &#8216;here are the things we&#8217;ve tried, and we hope there are better things soon!&#8221;</p>

The event is designed to share strategies for student success, facilitate networking and community-building among educators, and connect teachers and local organizations to exchange ideas on region-specific science topics to help engage students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s conference has a sustainability theme, with a keynote speech by UC Santa Cruz alumna Judit Camacho, Co-Executive Director of the local garden-based education organization <a href="https://www.lifelab.org/">Life Lab</a>. Other participating organizations include the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, CalRecycle, Elkhorn Slough Foundation, Monterey Bay Area Mathematics Project (MBAMP), and the Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gretchen Andreasen, director of </span><a href="https://calteach.science.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Cal Teach Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Soleste Hilberg, director of the </span><a href="https://education.ucsc.edu/academics/mac-info/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teacher Education Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in UCSC&#8217;s Education Department, served on the planning team for the conference. Andreasen said the local focus is part of what makes the conference uniquely valuable.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some of the teachers who we work with have said that professional development meetings are often too abstract and not focused enough on the particular local needs of the community,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;In our region, we&#8217;re lucky to have really rich local STEM resources, from both informal and formal educational institutions, so this conference draws on those resources to serve the specific needs of our local teachers and our local student population.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting will cover a wide range of topics, from climate change to artificial intelligence. UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Education Eduardo Mosqueda will present a session on how language-learning is related to math education opportunities, UCSC Assistant Professor of Education Emily Reigh will demonstrate how students can use data to explore social justice and climate change issues in California&#8217;s food systems, and UCSC teacher educator Johnnie Wilson will discuss how to support parents in teaching math to their children. MBAMP, based in UCSC&#8217;s Mathematics Department, will offer a session on integrating math games into instruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will also be a meet-and-greet with representatives from 11 local school districts and offices of education. Teachers from each of the participating districts can attend for free, and others who would like to attend can </span><a href="https://commerce.cashnet.com/cashneti/static/storefront/csumb_E036S/login?token=storefront:eXKXq3XIk8XsutaFIqvEgrvdAXjNdqO2texkIlQg7ZwX"><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase tickets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online. Students from UC Santa Cruz and other local universities and colleges who are interested in teaching will also participate in order to connect with the local STEM education community and learn more about the challenges and rewards that come with the career.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Andreasen and Hilberg consider the event part of their broader efforts to recruit and train STEM teachers and close gaps in academic achievement and college readiness among K-12 students in California. There&#8217;s currently a shortage of math and science teachers in the state, and Hilberg says part of the problem is a lack of understanding about the benefits of a career in education. She hopes that college students who attend the conference will be reassured and empowered to pursue their interest in teaching.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to get the word out that teaching is really a great career,&#8221; Hilberg said. &#8220;Salaries for mid-career and advanced-career teachers are actually highly competitive, plus the profession offers retirement pensions, high job security and stability, and STEM teachers have high rates of job satisfaction. But the most important thing is that it&#8217;s incredibly rewarding to be able to make a positive difference in the lives of kids.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz offers several programs to help students explore and prepare for careers in teaching. UCSC&#8217;s </span><a href="https://education.ucsc.edu/academics/mac-info/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teacher Education Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, led by Hilberg, trains new K-12 teachers through a one-year combined master&#8217;s degree and teaching credential program, while </span><a href="https://calteach.science.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cal Teach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, led by Andreasen, places university STEM majors in K-12 classrooms as teaching interns.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1dde2dfa807270467057cc3dcb3da9ea"><name>ben-breen-psychedelics-book-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Historian Benjamin Breen explores the troubled birth of psychedelic science in acclaimed new book, Tripping On Utopia. </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz Associate History Professor Benjamin Breen will read from his new book about the fraught history of Cold War-era psychedelic science at Bookshop Santa Cruz this Tuesday.&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But their dreams about the potentials of psychedelic research collided with seamier realities, including unethical government testing of these substances on unwitting humans, writes University of California, Santa Cruz Associate Professor of History Benjamin Breen in his acclaimed new book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tripping on Utopia: Margaret Mead, The Cold War, and The Troubled Birth of Psychedelic Science </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Grand Central Publishing.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breen is also the author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Age of Intoxication: Origins of the Global Drug Trade</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, winner of the 2021 William H. Welch Medal from the American Association for the History of Medicine.</span><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tripping On Utopia </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">delves deeply into the early utopianism of psychedelics researchers including Mead and Bateson, who had strong, idealistic beliefs in the power of altered states of consciousness to help humanity heal after the trauma of World War II.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the book also goes into detail about how easily such dreams can be coopted for dubious purposes. Breen shares the bizarre story of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">American physician John C. Lilly&#8217;s widely publicized dosing of dolphins - and himself - with LSD in a NASA-funded experiment into whether dolphins could be induced to communicate with humans.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breen also describes the widely reviled CIA-funded and administered MKULTRA program, which tested psychedelics and other substances on unsuspecting participants to test enhanced interrogation techniques during the Cold War. The program, which started in the early 1950s, was kept a secret until 1975.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breen&#8217;s canny combination of startling details and rigorous archival research, along with the current revived interest in the therapeutic potentials of psychedelics, has made </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tripping On Utopia </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a hot new nonfiction title.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newly released book is getting the kind of massive publicity and buzz that eludes most nonfiction authors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/books/review/tripping-on-utopia-benjamin-breen.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A detailed laudatory New York Times review </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">went live this week, </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/16/1224894129/margaret-meads-psychedelics-benjamin-breen-tripping-on-utopia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">along with Breen&#8217;s recent chat with Terry Gross&#8211; arguably the world&#8217;s most famous living radio interviewer &#8211; on her NPR show, &#8220;Fresh Air.&#8221;</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than embark on a barnstorming book tour, Breen will stick close to home. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I'm actually going to go on paternity leave pretty soon,&#8221; Breen said. &#8220;And so I'm honestly just switching gears to putting together a crib and organizing the diaper changing station.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, he&#8217;s excited about the chance to reach a wide audience with a book that is heavy on research and interviews, and arose, in part, from his experiences as a p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rinciple Investigator of the 2019-2020 </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/clusters/drug-histories-and-futures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THI research cluster Drug Histories and Futures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Often, we (academics) are not really trained or oriented towards speaking to the general public and I think it's a real privilege and honor to do it,&#8221; said Breen, who honed his ability to reach a non-academic audience during a funny, irreverent, and sometimes gasp-inducing talk </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">called &#8220;Summoning Spirits,&#8221; at the 2019 edition of Alumni Weekend on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that sold-out talk, which was geared to non-academics, he explored the strange and mutable life of distilled liquor from the 15th through the 18th centuries, and its changing identities, from miracle elixir to alleged social scourge.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The reason I became interested in history was from hearing people speak on Fresh Air and places like that,&#8221; Breen explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s central to my work as an historian to reach a wider public and make it legible to them. And also it's really important for UCSC and UCSC&#8217;s Humanities Division, which is very strong on community engaged scholarship. That outreach is part of the mission of a public university.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tripping On Utopia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has sparked widespread discussion about one of Breen&#8217;s provocative and rigorously researched arguments: that the era of psychedelic drug experimentation did not begin in the &#8216;60s but the 1930s.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, the 1960s marked the end, not the beginning, of the Cold War psychedelic research era, he argues. As early as the 1940s, these mind-altering substances were entering the mainstream, at a time when they were not just legal but hailed as potential shortcuts to self-awareness and actualization.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But government bodies soon elbowed their way into Mead&#8217;s and Bateson&#8217;s utopian visions of these drugs&#8217; potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Breen explains in the book, the Office of Strategic Services &#8211; the World War II-era forerunner of the CIA - helped direct and shape psychedelic research early on.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After LSD was discovered in 1943, the CIA soon recognized its potential as a secret weapon for Americans to wield against its enemies in the Cold War.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Mead and Bateson worked on an OSS team that explored hypnosis and mind-altering drugs as tools against totalitarian governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But both of them &#8211; and Bateson in particular &#8211; were horrified about the deceitful way in which many of those experiments were carried out.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CIA bankrolled public LSD studies in the MKULTRA program, which used the Macy Foundation as a research front. Both Bateson and Mead were involved in the foundation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MKULTRA would become notorious for its disregard of legality as well as ethics as researchers engaged in drug testing on subjects without their consent.&#160; Breen writes that &#8220;scraps, and hints, fragments of a larger story&#8221; strongly suggest that &#8220;despite her genuine good intentions, Mead likely contributed in some way to a project that has gone down in history as among the twentieth century&#8217;s most infamous abuses of medical research ethics.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breen hopes that his book - including those troubling passages about MKULTRA - are helpful for contemporary scientists who are embarking on their own psychedelic research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that ongoing work is happening at UC San Francisco, whose</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Neuroscape Psychedelics Division is dedicated to advancing the field of psychedelic science and medicine through multi-level research covering basic to translational to clinical science.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research aims for breakthrough discoveries in psychiatry, neurology and neuroscience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breen said that today&#8217;s scientists should learn from Mead&#8217;s capacious view of psychedelic research, which encompassed non-Western cultural traditions as well as mainstream medical approaches.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To a certain extent, that kind of research integration is happening today.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I think there's a danger of creating this false binary between those two approaches,&#8221; Breen said. &#8220;On the one hand, we have the prescription psychedelics - which I think is going to happen quite soon - and on the other, there is a somewhat naive set of assumptions about psychedelic or plant medicine as something which is fixed in an unchanging past.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In reality&#160; there's a huge amount of gray area between those two areas,&#8221; Breen continued. &#8220;For instance, there are anthropologists who do field work with non Western cultures of psychedelic use and then also are interested in the medical applications today.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, many of the lessons of the past are most helpful in terms of showing today&#8217;s scientists what not to do, Breen said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#8220;Getting informed consent (from research subjects) and being transparent with people is crucial,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At best, the 1950s approach to psychedelic medicine was somewhat condescending because it assumed an expert authority who is coming from on high and giving instructions, and at worst it was pretty brutal, with testing on unwitting civilians.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breen notes that Mead never publicly endorsed the use of LSD, nor is there any evidence that she ever used it herself - though she did write, in unpublished letters from 1954, that she intended to volunteer to take it as part of a study.&#160; If Mead had ever made such a bold public statement about this drug, her fame and influence could have reshaped the legal and social trajectory of LSD in particular, and psychedelics as a whole, Breen said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Margaret Mead&#160; really is there at the very beginning of widespread awareness of LSD, and&#160; she has this history of researching peyote,&#8221; Breen said. &#8220;<span>&#8220;In the&#160;</span>1930s<span>, her mentor Franz Boas, the anthropologist, had actually come out in favor of keeping peyote legal&#160;</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a religious sacrament, so she was really looped in with that world very early.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mead&#8217;s reticence about the drug made it possible for others, including the notorious self-publicizer and LSD proselytizer Timothy Leary, to assume the role of psychedelics advocate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I personally think it would have been far preferable to have Mead in that role,&#8221; Breen said. &#8220;You know, Margaret Mead was not perfect, but she was deeply thoughtful and also motivated by genuine idealism.

The researchers will work with an international team to build and test systems in Santa Cruz and eventually install the final designs in seven telescopes at three ground-based observatory sites around the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The alignment systems will be the first major United States contribution to the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), an international project that aims to improve our understanding of the universe through gamma-ray research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Very high-energy gamma rays give us a way to probe some of the most extreme events in the universe &#8212; things like gamma-ray bursts that come from the mergers of two black holes or the collapse of a star much more massive than our sun after it&#8217;s burned out,&#8221; said David Williams, a researcher in the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) and an adjunct professor of physics who has worked on the development of CTAO for nearly 20 years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy Furniss, a new UC Santa Cruz teaching professor, is working alongside Williams on the alignment system project. She added that studying extreme events helps scientists investigate the formation of the universe and the properties of matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you really want to understand how something works, you put it in extreme states,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So if you want to understand how steel works, you're going to heat it up and bend it around and do all these extreme things to it... the black holes, the galaxies, the pulsars, the gamma-ray bursts are doing the job of putting matter into those extreme states so we can really understand how it works.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark matter is another focus for gamma-ray researchers, and the next generation of telescopes will open the door for new research questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;CTAO is uniquely capable of looking for those gamma rays from dark matter particles at a certain mass range that hasn&#8217;t yet been explored,&#8221; said Williams.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new CTAO telescopes are expected to be five to ten times more sensitive than the current generation of ground-based gamma-ray detectors. With over sixty telescopes at two sites &#8212; Paranal in Chile and La Palma in Spain &#8212; the CTAO will also allow scientists to complete sky surveys about three hundred times faster than is currently possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers plan to install the first Medium-Sized Telescopes at the two CTAO sites. After their completion, CTAO intends to build at least 21 more Medium-Sized Telescopes, which could lead to additional involvement for UC Santa Cruz scientists and students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Santa Cruz-led team will also install alignment systems at the Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT) prototype for CTAO at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona. The scientists expect that installation to begin in early 2026.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>The groundwork</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every telescope has around a hundred mirror segments that will each need their own alignment system. The lab at UC Santa Cruz will develop ideas for the systems, build prototypes and work with manufacturers to find a scalable option. In addition to being accurate, reliable and cost-effective, the systems must also be hardy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need it to withstand the weather and the elements, because, unlike optical telescopes, the gamma-ray telescopes don't have domes over them. They're sitting out in the weather,&#8221; said Williams.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is based out of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics, which &#8220;has long had a strength in doing instrumentation for high-energy particle physics and now high-energy particle astrophysics,&#8221; said Williams. Designing and testing the systems will allow early career scientists and students to experience hands-on research and training and contribute to a large international goal.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be able to see things with higher resolution,&#8221; said Furniss. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be able to see things farther afield, and our students, our graduate students and our faculty here at UC Santa Cruz, by putting in that work at the fundamental level, are going to be part of making this huge effort possible,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Santa Cruz team will work with colleagues at UCLA, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY and Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics Tuebingen (IAAT) in Germany.&#160; UCLA will lead the development of the positioning system for the SCT mirrors. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SAO will manage the alignment system installation on the SCT and its subsequent operation.&#160; The Goddard team will develop software for operating the SCT alignment system.&#160; DESY is the lead group for the medium-sized telescopes at the two CTAO sites and will design and fabricate the electronics for the alignment systems on those telescopes. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IAAT will provide precision test equipment and protocols to verify the performance of the production components for the CTAO sites.&#160; Once completed, the project will also benefit other researchers around the country and the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the first direct U.S. contribution to CTA construction,&#8221; said Williams. &#8220;And as such, it will potentially open up access to CTA data for U.S. scientists.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the grant, the researchers will also lead the development of K-12 curriculum about gamma-ray astronomy. Over the summer, experts in high-energy gamma-ray astrophysics will collaborate with educators to design materials for different grade levels. The following summer, researchers will host teacher trainings.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s an opportunity for us to create curricular materials and pedagogical tools so we can start introducing these different viewpoints of the universe from gamma rays into the classroom at the earliest stages possible,&#8221; said Furniss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the advances in technology led by UC Santa Cruz and CTA partners around the world, scientists expect there to be plenty of new, exciting observations to teach about in the years to come.</span></p>

Dodd</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When stars get too close to the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, the black holes shred them apart in a process called a tidal disruption event (TDE). These TDEs cause bright flashes, but recent models suggest that scientists should see more of them than have been observed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One leading idea about the missing TDEs was that dust within some galaxies blocks the emission of visible light, obscuring certain TDEs from view. To investigate this possibility, a team of students at the University of California, Santa Cruz looked to the infrared, where the dust reemits most of the original light signal. In a </span><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad1112"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, they determine that scientists are not likely missing tidal disruption events because of dust &#8212; sending those searching for missing TDEs back to the drawing board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers studied the properties of 103 nearby galaxies that exhibit mid-infrared outbursts using a catalog based off of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. They compared these galaxies to known tidal disruption events and active galactic nuclei &#8212; the bright centers of galaxies that emit light as the central supermassive black hole gulps down nearby gas&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To their surprise, the researchers found that many of the mid-infrared outbursts they studied were likely not caused by tidal disruption events and instead looked more like highly variable active galactic nuclei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team, led by UC Santa Cruz Astronomy and Astrophysics PhD student Sierra Dodd, analyzed star formation rate and total stellar mass in the galaxies, as well as the dust properties of the nearby galaxies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t go in with strong expectations,&#8221; said Dodd. But one finding in particular surprised her.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous assumptions held that the amount of dust in the center of a galaxy correlates to the amount of dust in the galaxy as a whole.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People were saying these certain highly-star forming galaxies that have more dust in them at large will probably have more dust in the nucleus, and therefore we&#8217;d be missing a bunch of tidal disruptions,&#8221; said Dodd. &#8220;So when we analyzed the dust mass in the center versus the galaxy for the 103 mid-infrared outbursts that we had and found that they weren&#8217;t correlated, that was very surprising to me.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The implication that most of the mid-infrared outbursts are not hidden black holes tearing stars apart brings astrophysicists back to searching for an explanation for missing TDEs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now that we found out that that&#8217;s probably not the case, it means that we&#8217;re still missing a population of these tidal disruption events or the models are missing something,&#8221; said Dodd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She says the discovery of more mid-infrared outbursts and tidal disruption events will help researchers uncover where the missing TDEs are and what is causing some of the non-TDE outbursts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Doing some simulations of tidal disruption events and seeing what it might look like to have one enshrouded in dust would be useful as well,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lamat Institute gets students involved</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the project, Dodd mentored two students in </span><a href="https://lamat.science.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Lamat Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arya Nukala learned to use the galaxy catalog and contributed to analysis as a high school student, and Isabelle Connor worked on graphing and data analysis as a second-year undergraduate student at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lamat is this incredible research program that focuses on giving opportunities in STEM to underrepresented groups of people. They focus a lot on not having to leave your identity at the door when you go into a space of academia, which is amazing,&#8221; said Connor. &#8220;It was my first experience, and to be able to do that in my first year of college was just extremely transformative and opened so many doors for me.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She adds that the Lamat Institute made the transition from competitive Olympic-level gymnastics to academia much easier for her. She plans to stay involved in the Lamat Institute and expand on her black hole research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think overall it&#8217;s really cool how even just in this specific area of study of black holes, there&#8217;s still so much that people have yet to do research on,&#8221; Connor said. &#8220;It makes whatever you find very exciting because you are one of the first people to test and question assumptions that have been made with actual data... TDEs do seem to be quite unique events that happen in a very specific area, and I hope we can learn more about how we can find this unaccounted-for population.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1eda3ccf807270467057cc3d2232d3a2"><name>sab-winter-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Invitation to the SAB Virtual Winter Forum on January 31, 2024</title><summary>The purpose of the SAB-supported forums is to provide staff with an opportunity to ask questions of campus leadership.</summary><start-date>1705478400000</start-date><display-name>Invitation to the SAB Virtual Winter Forum on January 31, 2024</display-name><path>/2024/01/sab-winter-forum</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/01/sab-winter-forum</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1705619635389</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1705619635389</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr">The Staff Advisory Board enthusiastically invites you to attend our Winter Forum on Wednesday, January 31, 2024, at noon.

<p><a href="https://kapsar.sites.ucsc.edu/meet-the-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anne Kapuscinski</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an interdisciplinary scholar committed to finding scientifically and socially robust solutions to issues affecting coastal communities. She was the natural fit to lead the new </span><a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coastal Science and Policy </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(CSP) graduate program which offers a two-year master of science degree and a PhD designated emphasis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kapuscinski, whose research has included examining the impacts of dams, fish hatcheries, aquaculture, and genetic engineering on fish conservation, is a leader in sustainability science and shifting aquaculture&#8212;the world&#8217;s fastest-growing food sector&#8212;towards enhancing food diversity and climate resiliency in coastal regions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She has served</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a scientific advisor at the national and global level and currently chairs the Board of Directors of the Union of Concerned Scientists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since joining UCSC in 2018, Kapuscinski has led six cohorts through the inaugural years of CSP. The program prepares rising leaders to identify, innovate, and implement scalable and socially just solutions to climate, biodiversity, and other sustainability challenges in coastal zones around the world.</span></p>
<h3><strong>The start of something new</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kapuscinski was more than keen to join the new endeavor at UCSC, the first of its kind in the UC system. She had led two programs with interdisciplinary goals like CSP at previous institutions but both lacked the central focus that CSP has on using interdisciplinary approaches to design and implement practical solutions. She was excited to see what kind of an impact that the practical focus, close collaboration with practitioners, and global scope of CSP could make.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was inspired by the opportunity to lead, teach, and mentor in a graduate program with a deep-change structure to it, and that has this more &#8216;out-of-the-box&#8217; way of thinking about advancing solutions,&#8221; she says. For example, under her leadership, CSP launched the nation&#8217;s first </span><a href="https://hacking4oceans.ucsc.edu/home"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hacking for Oceans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> course, where graduate and undergraduate students use Lean Startup methods to solve actual problems facing ocean focused organizations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CSP program uses a cohort structure to provide in-depth mentorship and a collaborative space for its students, most of whom have worked professionally before starting graduate studies. The students in each cohort work together through coursework over the first year and then conduct individual&#160; capstone projects with a partner organization either locally, elsewhere in the US, or abroad for the second year. This can include work with nationally recognized or globally recognized organizations as well as organizations that the students had worked with before their time at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cohort structure has led to students deeply bonding over both their singular and collective projects to advance solutions to complex coastal challenges. For example, they have addressed issues such as conserving marine biodiversity, shifting fishing and aquaculture to sustainability, and enhancing coastal climate resilience while improving equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the added benefits of the cohort structure is the transformative learning and new connections that emerge from a supportive community with high diversity, reflected among the program&#8217;s students, their past professional standings, and their projects. Kapuscinski notes that this aspect&#8212;an opportunity for students from the U.S. to work with and learn from students from Belize, Indonesia, and Malawi, for instance&#8212;has made the program all the more competitive with other renowned universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As the director, but also as someone learning along with our students and our faculty, I have found that to be one of the most rewarding aspects of the program,&#8221; Kapuscinski said. &#8220;I can genuinely say I have learned so much more myself, from being in a community and leading a community of students with such great diversity of lived and professional experiences at the table.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Building community along the coast</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program has trained 78 students thus far, representing 23 nations including the US. Their successes have proven that CSP serves as a stepping stone to advancing their careers and discovering solutions to environmental issues. Since 2020, CSP also has extended its impact by running the </span><a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/blue-pioneers-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue Pioneers Accelerator Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enhancing innovation skills and collaborative networks of&#160; 82 early career, marine conservation working professionals from the Asia Pacific region.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly every student in CSP is hired&#8212;either permanently or in long-term contractual work&#8212;within six months of graduating or less according to Sarah Eminhizer, CSP director of programs and workplace development. More often than not, the students had worked previously in their chosen field, and the added training from CSP propels them forward into more influential positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ross Davison can attest to that fact. A member of the first cohort which graduated in 2020, Davison had previously worked in archeological preservation and habitat conservation, spending nearly a decade with private, public, and multinational stakeholders to utilize high-tech and innovative tools to protect natural capital. With his roommate, an ecologist, the pair formed a startup that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">used machine learning (also now called AI) to guide conservation of coastal lands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even still, Davison wanted to expand his understanding of conservation work, and applied for the newly launched CSP program, soon returning to his undergraduate alma mater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was very cool for us to get the first pass at the program, and define what we wanted from it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because our cohort developed strong connections, it let us have more of that&#8230;there was a nice dialogue those first two years.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fter graduating from CSP, Davison founded</span> <a href="https://www.understory.ai"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">focusing on remote monitoring and evaluating conservation interventions and natural capital from his home base in Pacific Grove. He also won highly competitive National Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research grants for his startup development.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamal Galves is a member of the class of 2023, with a primary focus on manatee conservation. The Belizean native had worked as a program coordinator and research </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">biologist for </span><a href="https://mission.cmaquarium.org/research-institute/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Clearwater Marine Aquarium Research Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, emphasizing manatees as a flagship species to promote coastal conservation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was excited by the opportunity to attend UCSC due to its renowned work in the science and coastal conservation community. The added benefit of being part of the CSP program helped to establish a &#8220;practicality&#8221; to his continued efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re coming from a place that provides recognized knowledge,&#8221; Galves said. &#8220;I felt that it was more fitting for me to get into a program that would allow me to pick up from where I am, a program that translates into action&#8230;you can leave with a world of knowledge, experience, partnership, and networks that allows you to move into many organizations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Galves said, reflecting on the practicality of the program in tandem with mentoring helped him influence policy change: &#8220;It encompassed what I needed for my future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galves has returned home to Belize, where he has continued working with manatees and sharing his work via Instagram to his 75,000 followers. Recently, h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e was recognized as one of </span><a href="https://theexplorersclub.cmail20.com/t/y-e-nkutitd-dyityuyhjk-o/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Explorers Club 50</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and has also been featured on an </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/podcast/meet-the-manatee-man/?fbclid=PAAaaBKk1fm8U_qvl0k7nmepn-TUFalkYRHKX8RHQTYJtHwX-2cuSIkHnOvI4_aem_AQHX4pm9e67-Poj80yqpTk1M0ml3eLlDrS9hSwDyo1J4MMNdKP3_mKYbSgLTl2WCikk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brook Thompson is currently completing her second year in the CSP PhD designated emphasis, while also working toward her Ph.D. degree in environmental studies. Thompson brings her background as a Yurok and Karuk Native of Northern California to her studies, focusing on water rights, salmon restoration and Native American rights through frontline activism. She spoke about these issues on an international panel of indigenous leaders at COP27, the 2022 United Nations climate treaty negotiations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For me, what aligns well is that I get to be on the policy side and have this deeper understanding of coastal policies that affect my people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Through CSP, I have the privilege to travel and work with a global community, finding similarities between different groups across the world and issues facing our coastal communities.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, Thompson was also one of 87 students nationally to be awarded the prestigious Predoctoral Ford Foundation Scholarship.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Towards the future</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kapuscinski and the team have launched a six-year evaluation to strengthen the program for cohorts to come. Among the issues at the forefront of their minds, Kapuscinski notes, &#8220;We want to scale the training of early-career leaders while maintaining the program&#8217;s best qualities, such as the strongly supportive, diverse community and steady stream of <a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/">honors</a> awarded to our students.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another goal is to turn the global scope and influence of CSP alumni into a collective force to help drive policies and actions that accelerate coastal solutions that work. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the esteemed awardees is Terrie M. Williams, a comparative ecophysiologist from the University of California, Santa Cruz, who will be honored with the 2024 NAS Award in the Evolution of Earth and Life - Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams, renowned for her groundbreaking work in the ecological physiology of large mammals, will receive the award, accompanied by a $20,000 prize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am so excited to be standing on the shoulders of the previous recipients of this award. One of the first, nearly a century ago was Ernest Thomspon Seton, a personal hero of mine. His books and illustrations detailing the lives of wild animals inspired my entire career,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;I&#8217;m working on an illustrated book of big mammals hoping to emulate his awe of nature.&#8221; &#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams' profound impact on the field of ecological physiology stems from her fundamental contributions to understanding the functioning of large mammals within their varied habitats. Her research has transformed our comprehension of the ecological significance of large carnivores, unraveling the physiological adaptations crucial for species survival in an ever-changing world shaped by human impacts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delving into the metabolic, cardiovascular, neural, and thermal physiology of terrestrial and aquatic mammals, Williams has meticulously detailed the intricate relationships between animals and their environment. Her innovative micro-technologies have facilitated field measurements of the physiology of free-ranging mammals, including Arctic narwhals, sea otters, African lions, seals, and polar bears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal, bestowed in recognition of a most meritorious, recently published work in zoology or paleontology, serves as a testament to Williams' exemplary contributions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The winners will be honored in a ceremony during the National Academy of Sciences&#8217; 161</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual meeting on April 28, 2024.</span></p>
<h4><strong>About the National Academy of Sciences</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit institution that was established under a congressional charter signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. It recognizes achievement in&#160; science by election to membership, and &#8212; with the National Academy of Engineering and the National&#160; Academy of Medicine &#8212; provides science, engineering, and health policy advice to the federal&#160; government and other organizations.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3228d22680727046200c01f4debec559"><name>safety-study</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Call for participation: Campus roads Bike and Pedestrian Safety Study</title><summary>The University of California, Santa Cruz has recently launched the Campus Roads Bike and Pedestrian Safety Study to identify safety enhancements and develop conceptual street designs for key campus corridors.</summary><start-date>1705910400000</start-date><path>/2024/01/safety-study</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/01/safety-study</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1705943552533</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1706025302396</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California, Santa Cruz has recently launched the Campus Roads Bike and Pedestrian Safety Study to identify safety enhancements and develop conceptual street designs for key campus corridors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study aims to develop concept designs that would improve safety for vulnerable road users while taking into consideration the broader context of university mobility and the campus experience. Ultimately this study will assist UC Santa Cruz in securing grant and other funding to advance priority corridor improvements through to construction. This study is the first in a series of transportation initiatives on campus to improve circulation, mobility and safety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That project also put 1619 into the popular imagination as a fateful year in slavery&#8217;s history.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why was that year a turning point for the institution of slavery in America? This question lies at the heart of </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/what-actually-happened-in-1619-the-origins-of-slavery-in-north-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What Actually Happened In 1619,&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a panel discussion that uses </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1619 Project</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a jumping off point for a deeper dive into the happenings and consequences of that year. </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Humanities Institute at the University of California, Santa Cruz (THI)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is presenting this free event on Thursday, Feb. 1, from 6:30-8:30 p.m. at the Music Recital Hall on campus.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This panel brings together three historians who have done extensive research on slavery: UCSC History Professor Gregory O&#8217;Malley, author of</span> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Passages-Intercolonial-1619-1807-University-dp-1469629844/dp/1469629844/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid="><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Passages: The Intercolonial Slave Trade of British America, 1619-1807</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (University of North Carolina Press, 2014)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">;&#160; Elise Mitchell, Presidential Postdoctoral Research Fellow in History at Princeton University, whose essay, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#8220;Morbid Crossings: Surviving Smallpox, Maritime Quarantine, and the Gendered Geography of the Early Eighteenth-Century Intra-Caribbean Slave Trade,&#8221; appeared in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">William and Mary Quarterly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and UC Merced Associate Professor of History Kevin Dawson, author of </span><a href="https://www.pennpress.org/9780812224931/undercurrents-of-power/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ndercurrents of Power: Aquatic Culture in the African Diaspora</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2021).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O&#8217;Malley notes that the essays collected in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1619 Project </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the public conversations that followed only touch on the events of that year, or even on the slave trade more generally.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1619 Project</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focuses crucial attention on the legacy of that year, with essays on slavery&#8217;s long-term impacts on American democracy, capitalism, incarceration, and even modern transportation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As an historian of colonial America and the slave trade, I&#8217;ve noticed that many people are left with only hazy notions of what happened in 1619,&#8221; O&#8217;Malley said. &#8220;So I hope &#8216;What Actually Happened In 1619&#8217; will help people understand how slavery took root in North America. I&#8217;m hoping the upcoming event will illustrate that slavery spread to the English colonies in North America rather than being invented there. I want to underscore how early that date is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O&#8217;Malley notes that the Mayflower</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">landed in New England in 1620, a year later than the first enslaved Africans landed in Virginia. &#8220;This begs the question of why so many people now know the name of the Mayflower, but few know that the ship delivering the English colonies' first Africans was the White Lion,&#8221; O&#8217;Malley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White Lion was also a privateering vessel, which stole its captives from a Portuguese ship trying to deliver enslaved people to Spanish America.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O&#8217;Malley hopes the event will invite reflection on the importance of slavery to colonial empires, as illustrated by sending privateers to steal enslaved people from one another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elise Mitchell will focus more on the shipboard experiences of enslaved people, with a particular eye to disease and the other dangers of being a captive in the ugly business of slavery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Dawson will address the knowledge, culture, and ideas that enslaved African women and men carried with them, with a particular focus on maritime skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enslaved people were denied the right to bring possessions to the Americas, but they brought ideas, skills, and ways of seeing the world that shaped colonial life and economies, with legacies that persist.</span></p>

<p>The Coha Nowark Art &amp; Science Residency program brings artists and scientists together to innovate creative, social justice-oriented approaches to climate change. Through the three year pilot program, nationally significant artists, selected by&#160;<span>University of California, Santa Cruz</span> faculty and IAS staff, are awarded residencies at the IAS. During these residencies, the artists will develop new work in conversation with&#160;<span>UC Santa Cruz</span>&#160;scientists at the Friedlaender Lab studying the impacts of environmental change on large marine mammals. The residency program provides support for the collaborative conversations and projects which emerge from these partnerships, and the production of new artworks about climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vicki and I are happy to be supporting this art + science initiative,&#8221; Peter Coha said. &#8220;While understanding the specific impacts of climate change on flora, fauna, and environment is important, we also need to consider the interrelations of these impacts across the web of life. When some threads are weakened or severed in the intricate interconnections that weave the fabric of life on Earth, how do the remaining threads and the fabric react to these changes? The IAS Art and Science Pilot Residency Program will enable artists and scientists to consider these shared vulnerabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first year of the program, the IAS has awarded two residencies. Imani Jacqueline Brown is an artist, activist, and architectural researcher from New Orleans, based in London, and Christine Howard Sandoval, an enrolled member of the Chalon Nation in Bakersfield, CA, is an artist and assistant professor of Interdisciplinary Art at Emily Carr University (Vancouver, BC). Both artists explore issues of ecology and the complex histories, including indigenous dispossession, slavery, and extractivism, which have contributed to climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are grateful to Peter and Vicki for supporting this new and transformation endeavor,&#8221; Dr. Rachel Nelson, director and chief curator of the IAS says. &#8220;Bringing these amazing artists into discussion with Ari Friedlaender and other scientists and researchers at UC Santa Cruz&#160; is reflective of our mission at the IAS to support artists and researchers in developing creative approaches to the crucial issues of our time, of which climate change is central. We need imaginative responses to the challenges we are facing in this rapidly changing world, and artists are key to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The artists will visit UC Santa Cruz several times over the course of their residency and will work with the Friedlaender Lab to develop their creative and&#160; research-based approaches to issues impacting focusing on climate resilience and community precarity. The resulting artworks and scientific research will be included in a major, group art + science exhibition at the IAS in Spring 2025.</p>
<p><strong>About the Artists</strong>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Imani Jacqueline Brown</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br/> Imani Jacqueline Brown (b. 1988) is an artist, activist, and architectural researcher from New Orleans, based in London. Her work investigates the &#8216;continuum of extractivism&#8217;, which spans from settler-colonial genocide and slavery to fossil fuel production, gentrification, and police and corporate impunity. In exposing the layers of violence and resistance that form the foundations of US society, she opens up space to imagine paths to ecological reparations.</p>
<p>Imani makes videos and installations, organizes public actions, delivers testimony to organs of the United Nations, occupies billboards, writes polemics, performs lectures, and uses counter-cartographic strategies to map the spatial logics that make geographies, unmake communities, and break Earth&#8217;s ecologies. Her work has been presented internationally, including in the US, the UK, Poland, Germany, and the UAE, most recently at the 12th Berlin Biennale. Among other things, she is currently a PhD candidate at Queen Mary, University of London, a research fellow with Forensic Architecture and an associate lecturer in MA Architecture at the Royal College of Arts.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Christine Howard Sandoval<br/> </strong>Christine Howard Sandoval is a multidisciplinary artist who questions the boundaries of representation, access, and habitation, where what is held in the land and what is held within state sponsored archives negotiate shared spaces of meaning.</p>
<p>Howard Sandoval&#8217;s work has exhibited nationally and internationally including: The 12th Seoul Mediacity Biennial (Seoul, S. Korea), Museo de Arte Contempor&#225;neo de la Universidad de S&#227;o Paulo (Brazil), The Contemporary Art Gallery (Vancouver, BC), Oregon Contemporary (Portland, OR), The Museum of Capitalism (Oakland, CA), Designtransfer, Universit&#228;t der K&#252;nste Berlin (Berlin, Germany), El Museo Del Barrio (New York, NY), and Socrates Sculpture Park (Queens, NY). Her work has been the subject of solo museum exhibitions at the ICA San Diego (2021) and Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center at Colorado College (2019).</p>
<p>Howard Sandoval currently lives in the unceded territories of the Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh, and Musqueam First Nations and is an Assistant Professor of Interdisciplinary Art at Emily Carr University (Vancouver, BC). Howard Sandoval is an enrolled member of the <span><a href="https://chalontribe.com/">Chalon Nation </a></span>in Bakersfield, CA.</p>

Shimizu discusses movies from the last decades including but not limited to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spa Night</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2016), </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellow Rose</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2019), </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Half of It</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2020), and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minari</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2020).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She uses psychoanalytic approaches to cinema in exploring the alienation and joy felt by Asian American youth especially in terms of race and gender. These conflicts overlap with the youth&#8217;s simultaneous infantilization, sexualization, and adultification. Shimizu explores&#160; representations of childhood, race, gender, and sexuality as a mode of empowerment towards self-reflection and attunement in cinema and child-rearing both.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born in the last days of the 1960s to Filipino political refugees, Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu moved to Boston in her early teens. She later moved to California to get her Bachelor's in Ethnic Studies from UC Berkeley, her Master of Fine Arts from UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, and her Ph.D. from Stanford University in Modern Thought and Literature. After getting married and having children, her youngest son Lakas suddenly died in 2013 due to&#160; a virus that attacked his heart. Shimizu&#8217;s experience as a grieving mother plays into the analysis of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Movies of Racial Childhoods</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Her family endowed a scholarship for UC Santa Cruz students in honor of her son.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other written works of Shimizu&#8217;s include her award-winning </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hypersexuality of Race (2007)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Straitjacket Sexualities </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2012)</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, The Proximity of Other Skins</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2020),&#160; as well as her co-editing of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Feminist Porn Book</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2013) and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unwatchability of Whiteness</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2018). Her movies have won numerous awards, and her last film, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">80 Years Later: On Japanese American Racial Inheritance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2022), was shown at 50 national and international festivals and won 19 awards. She is working on her new fiction film </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So To Speak</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filming in March 2024.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A film scholar and filmmaker, Shimizu is the Dean of the Arts Division at UC Santa Cruz since July of 2021. She previously led the School of Cinema at San Francisco State University and worked as a full professor of Asian American, Feminist, and Film and Media Studies at UC Santa Barbara&#160; where she chaired the Senior Women&#8217;s Council</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Engineering Shiva Abbaszadeh is developing technology that will enable precise multitracer positron emission tomography imaging of the human body&#8217;s most complex organ.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Positron emission tomography, or PET, uses radiotracers to allow researchers and clinicians to take images of organs and tissues inside the body. Abbaszadeh, an expert in PET imaging, is collaborating with researchers and clinicians at multiple institutions to create a new modality for the technology that will enable the detection of multiple biomarkers at once and improve the spatial resolution of brain imaging.&#160;<br/><br/>The research team will develop their technology with the support of a $4 million grant from the <a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health&#8217;s Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative</a>. The five-year project will consist of two years in simulation and proof-of-principle phase, followed by three years of exploratory and developmental phase to build the tomographic system.&#160;<br/><br/>The project is led by Professor of Medical Imaging at the University of Arizona Lars Furenlid, and other collaborators include Professor of Radiology at UMass Chan Medical School Michael King, Professor of Medicine at the University of Arizona Phillip Kuo, and Professor of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona Matthew Kupinski.<br/><br/>&#8220;The start of this technology was the first grant of my career, and now seeing that we are using the idea I had in my mind and implementing it for something bigger is very important,&#8221; Abbaszadeh said.<br/><br/>The technology, in line with the directive of the BRAIN Initiative, is not disease-specific, and instead is a general demonstration of technology that could be used for anything from cancer to neurodegenerative disease.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Technical developments for improved PET imaging</strong><br/><br/>PET imaging has been long seen as highly useful for the study of the brain. In PET imaging, a radiotracer is injected into the body and attached to a biomarker and releases gamma photon after&#160; positron annihilation, which can be detected to allow for imaging. It has not been possible to do imaging of multiple biomarkers at the same time because the positron signals are emitted at the same frequency and cannot be distinguished from each other.&#160;<br/><br/>However, Abbaszadeh&#8217;s technology aims to introduce a method for tracing multiple biomarkers at once by taking advantage of prompt gamma signals in addition to the positron signals. Prompt gamma signals are a second type of signal that can be detected through sophisticated PET imaging, making it possible to trace multiple biomarkers with one PET scan. Developing the scanners with a very wide dynamic range of detection enables the technology to measure both low to high energy tracers.&#160;<br/><br/>Multitracer imaging is useful for clinicians who want to observe multiple health indicators at once, such as the metabolic activity of a region and how well the region filters chemicals across the brain blood barrier. Mutlitracer imaging was not in high demand in the field just a few years ago, but now it has become increasingly relevant with more clarity on the clinical benefit of this imaging and the emergence of theranostics, which combines cancer diagnosis and treatment with radiotracers.<br/><br/>Despite the surge of interest in multitracer imaging for theranostics, at this point groups must use two separate scanners to do so, a cost and space hurdle that could be overcome by Abbaszadeh&#8217;s technology.&#160;<br/><br/>Using prompt gamma signals also helps to overcome spatial resolution limitations in PET imaging. This is particularly relevant for the BRAIN initiative as higher spatial resolution imaging is especially important for studying very small features of the brain.<br/><br/>PET imaging with positron signals is inherently limited by the nature of the physics involved, in that positrons can only travel for a limited distance, and the tracer does not capture the exact point of the positron in the body. Prompt gamma signals, on the other hand, do not have this spatial resolution issue, meaning imaging can be much more accurate.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;These tools haven&#8217;t been available before,&#8221; Abbaszadeh said. &#8220;We are leveraging the physics and the engineering of those tracers to come up with a new modality.&#8221;<br/><br/>The technology is direct conversion technology, which also improves spatial resolution image quality. Direct conversion detects high energy particles directly, whereas indirect conversion transforms high energy to visible light and then detect, which causes light to be isotropically scattered and thus lower resolution.&#160;<br/><br/>Once Abbaszadeh&#8217;s technology has been able to detect both the positron and the prompt-gamma signals, those signals must be reconstructed into a usable image. Using a joint reconstruction technique will greatly enhance the utility of the imaging. To do this, Abbaszadeh and her group will collaborate with researchers at the University of Arizona, world leaders in joint reconstruction.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Veins and the flow of blood through the body introduce an element of motion into the imaging, further complicating the process. Michael King at the UMass Chan Medical School is an expert in motion and will also collaborate on this project, correcting for motion in the imaging.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;I am very excited because three very good teams are coming together for this grant,&#8221; Abbaszadeh said. &#8220;Something really good is going to come out of it because we have all of the expertise that will lead to the success of this project.&#8221;&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>A fourth collaborator, Phillip Kuo, is professor of medicine, cancer biology, and biomedical engineering at the University of Arizona and a clinician who can help champion the technology among physicians to demonstrate its impact and advocate for adoption in the clinical world.&#160;<br/><br/>In general, Abbaszadeh sees this technology as a platform which can be adapted to the needs of different stakeholders, in this case doctors and clinicians within varying medical fields. In the future she hopes to expand the technology to a myriad of fields that could benefit from improved tomographic imaging. Abbaszadeh has seen the manufacturing costs of PET and semiconductor technology drop over the past ten years, and hopes to see this trend continue with innovation in the field.&#160;<br/><br/>This project is funded under the National Institutes of Health&#8217;s Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, which was established in 2013 to accelerate the development of innovative neurotechnologies.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="337e5c16807270467a9f6ffaf2ee6b47"><name>community-resources-israel-hamas-war</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Resources supporting community during Israel-Hamas War</title><summary>Last quarter our UC Santa Cruz community was deeply affected by the conflict in Israel and Palestine.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry, a James Beard Award&#8211;winning chef and author of several critically acclaimed cookbooks, is widely recognized for his groundbreaking work at the intersection of food, culture, and social justice. His commitment to promoting healthy, sustainable, and culturally relevant food practices aligns seamlessly with the principles and values championed by the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his interactive talk, &#8220;Food Justice: At the Intersection of Food, Politics, Poverty, Public Health, and the Environment," Terry will show how the food we eat can reduce the impacts of poverty and structural racism while increasing sustainability for all. Through a multisensory approach that fuses song, cooking, and personal history, Terry will explore how to improve access to fresh food in our communities and demonstrate how simple (and delicious) making better food choices can be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear UC Santa Cruz students,&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we settle into winter quarter, I&#8217;m writing to share important updates about the 2024-25 continuing student housing process.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>2024-25 continuing student housing selection process and eligibility changes</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the continuing student room selection process will be conducted via a lottery open to all eligible continuing students. The Room Selection Lottery will be completed across a series of passes throughout the month of April. For each pass, the order by which eligible students can access the 2024-25 Room Selection process will be determined by a randomized lottery.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be eligible for the Room Selection Lottery students must meet both of the following conditions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuously live in university housing during Winter 2024 and Spring 2024 quarters.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Re-apply for Fall 2024 university housing during the housing application period (Feb. 26 - March 4).</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Room Selection Lottery replaces the priority system for continuing student housing selection. While this new process affords all eligible continuing students an equal chance to participate in the housing lottery, we know this change is significant &#8211; especially for those who may have been expecting to receive priority housing status. In acknowledging the significance of this change &#8211; and its potential impact &#8211; I want to share more about the decision and the data that informed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you might expect, available housing capacity was the catalyst for this change. Though the total number of available beds has remained relatively steady over the past few years, various factors have impacted available housing for continuing students. These factors include our commitment to a one-year housing guarantee for new first year and transfer students as well as a considerable increase in the number of students who would have been eligible for priority status.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this, continuing to use a priority-based selection process as has been done in recent years would have resulted in a housing shortfall this year. While priority status was not a guarantee of housing, we always strived to accommodate students with priority and would no longer be able to do so. Facing such a shortfall informed our decision to replace priority-based housing selection with a lottery process open to all eligible continuing students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Earlier application period and process timeline</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In concert with the overall process changes and in an effort to afford students the opportunity to know sooner if they&#8217;ve secured on-campus housing, we will be starting &#8211; and ending &#8211; the selection process much earlier than in years past. This year, the continuing student housing application period will take place almost six weeks earlier than it has in recent years. It will open Monday, Feb. 26 and close Monday, March 4. </span><strong>Students currently living in university housing who are interested in reapplying for Fall 2024 must submit an application between Feb. 26 and March 4 to be eligible to participate in the room selection process.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Waitlist information</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the conclusion of the Room Selection Lottery, any student who has not selected a room will be placed on the continuing student housing waitlist. While housing staff will work throughout spring and summer to accommodate as many students as possible, all students placed on the waitlist are strongly encouraged to also begin looking for off-campus housing as soon as possible.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Off-campus housing support and resources</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who will be living off campus next year, we are committed to supporting your search. In the coming weeks, we will share more information about off-campus housing related resources to help build awareness of the tools available to you and how to access them. Be on the lookout for tabling sessions, off-campus housing fairs, the renters workshop and various other resources to help students navigate off-campus housing searches.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Additional information and next steps</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know you will likely have many questions about this new process. I encourage you to review <a href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/continuing/index.html">our housing website</a> for more information. Please continue checking your university email for updates, tips, events, and guidance about how best to prepare for and participate in the Room Selection Lottery and for information to support your off campus housing search.</span></p>
<p><strong>Housing Information Sessions&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each housing community will host Housing Information Sessions the week of Feb. 5 &#8211; Feb. 9. These sessions will offer greater detail about the Room Selection Lottery process as well as resources for off-campus housing. I encourage you to attend an information session to learn more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are committed to supporting you throughout the process. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a id="spanish"></a>Estimados estudiantes de la UC Santa Cruz:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Como ya entramos en el trimestre de invierno, les escribo para compartir actualizaciones importantes acerca del proceso de viviendas estudiantiles en curso para el 2024-25.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Selecci&#243;n de viviendas estudiantiles en curso para el 2024-25 y cambios en elegibilidad</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Este a&#241;o, el proceso de selecci&#243;n de viviendas estudiantiles en curso se har&#225; mediante una loter&#237;a abierta a todos los actuales estudiantes elegibles. La Loter&#237;a de Selecci&#243;n de Habitaciones se llevar&#225; a cabo por medio de una serie de pases durante el mes de abril. En cada pase, el orden en que los estudiantes elegibles tendr&#225;n acceso al proceso de Selecci&#243;n de Vivienda para el 2024-25 se determinar&#225; con una loter&#237;a al azar.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Para ser elegible para esa Loter&#237;a de Selecci&#243;n de Vivienda los estudiantes deber&#225;n cumplir con las siguientes condiciones:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haberse alojado de continuo en una vivienda de la universidad durante los trimestres de Invierno y de Primavera del 2024.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Re-solicitar alojamiento en una vivienda de la universidad para el Oto&#241;o del 2024 durante el periodo de solicitud de vivienda (26 de febrero al 4 de marzo).</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Loter&#237;a de Selecci&#243;n de Vivienda reemplaza el sistema de prioridad para la selecci&#243;n de vivienda estudiantil en curso. Si bien este nuevo proceso ofrece a todos los estudiantes elegibles en curso igualdad de oportunidades para participar en la loter&#237;a de viviendas, sabemos que este cambio es significativo &#8211; especialnente para aquellos que pudieran estar esperando tener prioridad en cuanto a su estatus de vivienda. Al admitir lo significativo de este cambio &#8211; y su potencial impacto &#8211; quiero compartir algo m&#225;s respecto a la decisi&#243;n y los datos que la respaldan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Como Uds. pudieran esperar, la capacidad de vivienda disponible ha sido el catalista de este cambio. Aunque el n&#250;mero total de camas disponibles se ha mantenido relativamente estable durante los a&#241;os recientes, hay varios factores que afectan las viviendas disponibles para los estudiantes que contin&#250;an. Estos factores incluyen nuestro compromiso de garantizar un a&#241;o de vivienda para los nuevos estudiantes de primer a&#241;o y los estudiantes trasladados, as&#237; como un aumento considerable en el n&#250;mero de estudiantes que hubieran sido elegibles para tener estatus de prioridad.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dado esto, continuar usando el proceso de selecci&#243;n basado en la prioridad como se ha estado haciendo en a&#241;os recientes hubiera causado que nos quedasemos cortos este a&#241;o. Aunque el estatus de prioridad no era una garant&#237;a de tener vivienda, nosotros siempre nos hemos esmerado en acomodar a los estudiantes con prioridad y ya no podr&#237;amos seguir haci&#233;ndolo de esa manera. El prever que nos quedar&#237;amos cortos dio pie a nuestra decisi&#243;n de reemplazar la selecci&#243;n de vivienda basada en la prioridad con un proceso de loter&#237;a abierto a todos los estudiantes elegibles en curso.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Adelanto del periodo de solicitud y cronograma del proceso</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conforme al proceso de cambios en general y haciendo un esfuerzo para facilitar a los estudiantes la oportunidad de saber m&#225;s temprano si han asegurado su vivienda en el campus, comenzaremos &#8211; y terminaremos &#8211; el proceso de selecci&#243;n mucho antes que en a&#241;os anteriores. Este a&#241;o, el periodo de solicitud para la vivienda estudiantil tendr&#225; lugar casi seis semanas antes que en a&#241;os recientes. Abrir&#225; el lunes, 26 de febrero y cerrar&#225; el lunes 4 de marzo. </span><strong>Los estudiantes actualmente alojados en viviendas de la universidad que est&#233;n interesados en resolicitar vivienda para el Oto&#241;o del 2024 deber&#225;n presentar una solicitud entre el 26 de febrero y el 4 de marzo para ser elegibles para participar en el proceso de selecci&#243;n de vivienda.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Informaci&#243;n sobre la lista espera</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al concluir la Loter&#237;a de Selecci&#243;n de Vivienda, cualquier estudiante que no haya seleccionado una vivienda ser&#225; colocado en una lista de espera de vivienda para estudiantes en curso. Mientras el personal de&#160; vivienda se ocupa durante la primavera y el verano de acomodar la mayor cantidad posible de estudiantes, se insta a todos los estudiantes colocados en la lista espera que tambi&#233;n busquen vivienda fuera del campus lo antes posible.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Apoyo y recursos para la vivienda fuera del campus</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Para aquellos de Uds. que se alojen fuera del campus el pr&#243;ximo a&#241;o, nos comprometemos a darles nuestro apoyo en su b&#250;squeda. En las pr&#243;ximas semanas, compartiremos m&#225;s informaci&#243;n acerca de los recursos relacionados con las viviendas fuera del campus a fin de ayudar a crear conciencia sobre los instrumentos disponibles para Uds. y c&#243;mo tener acceso a ellos. Est&#233;n al tanto de las sesiones de presentaci&#243;n, ferias de vivienda fuera del campus, talleres para inquilinos y varios otros recursos de ayuda al estudiante para navegar en su b&#250;squeda de vivienda fuera del campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Informaci&#243;n adicional y pr&#243;ximos pasos</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabemos que Uds. probablemente tendr&#225;n muchas preguntas acerca de este nuevo proceso. Los animo a echarle una mirada a <a href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/continuing/index.html">nuestro sitio </a></span><a href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/continuing/index.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">web</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, donde hallar&#225;n m&#225;s informaci&#243;n. Por favor contin&#250;e checando los </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">emails</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> que reciba de la universidad en cuanto a las actualizaciones, consejos pr&#225;cticos, eventos, y orientaci&#243;n sobre la mejor forma de prepararse para y participar en la Loter&#237;a de Selecci&#243;n de Vivienda, y a fin de obtener informaci&#243;n acerca del apoyo que le ofrecemos en su b&#250;squeda de vivienda fuera del campus.</span></p>
<p><strong>Sesiones de Informaci&#243;n sobre Vivienda&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cada comunidad de vivienda brindar&#225; Sesiones de Informaci&#243;n sobre Vivienda durante la semana del 5 al 9 de febrero. Estas sesiones ofrecer&#225;n m&#225;s detalles acerca del proceso de Loter&#237;a de Selecci&#243;n de Vivienda as&#237; como recursos para las viviendas fuera del campus. Los insto a que asistan a una Sesi&#243;n de Informaci&#243;n para aprender m&#225;s al respecto.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tenemos el compromiso de apoyarlos a Uds. a lo largo de todo este proceso. Por favor, no vacilen en dirigirse a nosotros con cualquier pregunta que puedan tener.</span></p>

<h2><span>Security and Privacy Guidance</span></h2>
<p><span>The guidance below outlines the appropriate use of generative AI as it relates to data security and privacy at UCSC. Due to the rapid evolution of generative AI, this guidance is likely to change. It is the responsibility of every member of our campus community to stay informed of data security and privacy policies, security protocols, and guidance.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Prohibited use</strong>: When using generative AI services, do not submit personal, confidential, or otherwise sensitive information, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII), FERPA-protected student records and information, and <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://its.ucsc.edu/policies/data-protect.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1706139054664000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0CPqXwo7D2dE1Yf-Vdgdhr" href="https://its.ucsc.edu/policies/data-protect.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">data classified as Moderate Risk (P3) or High Risk (P4)</a>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Permitted use</strong>: University faculty, staff, students and affiliates may enter institutional data into generative AI tools or services only when the information is classified as <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://its.ucsc.edu/policies/data-protect.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1706139054664000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0CPqXwo7D2dE1Yf-Vdgdhr" href="https://its.ucsc.edu/policies/data-protect.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Minimal Risk (P1) or Low Risk (P2)</a>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Procurement and licensing </strong>: All software licensing and supplier agreements must adhere to University of California (UC) policies for data security and privacy. The data security and privacy provisions contained in these agreements are a critical part of UC&#8217;s ongoing efforts to ensure the protection of the data and information related to its operations and the personal information of its staff, faculty, and students. However, UC Santa Cruz does not currently have licenses or agreements with any generative AI services that provide similar protections. The use of these services could expose individual users and UC to the potential loss and/or abuse of highly sensitive data and information. Follow the guidance outlined in items and 1 and 2 above.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong>Cultivating awareness</strong>: Some generative AI may be embedded within tools that you are already using (such as within Zoom, Microsoft, or Otter.AI) and you may not realize it has been enabled or is in use. Please be aware and exercise caution as this landscape evolves rapidly. ITS will develop additional guidance in this area soon.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Please share this message with any student employees that you manage or supervise.</span></p>

<h2><span>About Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)</span></h2>
<p><span>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to language models trained on massive amounts of data which are able to produce human-like responses in the form of text, code, images, audio, and video. Generative AI services, such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, Anthropic, and DALL-E, can be used to support teaching and learning, research, and administration.</span></p>
<p><span>Similar to a search engine, you can submit questions or prompts to these platforms. However, unlike a search engine that just returns links to more information, Generative AI platforms can take the user-generated questions and provide comprehensive responses, in certain instances, may even complete tasks on your behalf.</span></p>
<p><span>Individuals can submit more information into a generative AI platform in order for it to do more accurate work for them; however, the utility of generative AI platforms needs to be balanced with the inherent risks to information security and privacy.

<p>In the days ahead, we hope to better understand what will be needed to repair and reopen the road. We will share more information as soon as we have an anticipated reopening date.</p>
<h2>Campus Transit services / METRO</h2>
<p>Campus Transit will operate modified Loops and Upper Campus routes, and will continue to serve the Village stops in both directions as well as the interior of East Remote. East Field House and Quarry stops will not be served during this closure, nor will East Remote stops on Hagar.</p>
<p>In addition to continuing to serve all other regular stops, Campus Transit modified routing will include detours into Cowell Circle, in both directions for picking up and dropping off passengers.</p>
<p>METRO will bypass Hagar completely during the closure, instead using Coolidge in both directions. This will result in the suspension of METRO service at Quarry, East Field House, East Remote and Village. METRO will pick up and drop off eastbound passengers at McLaughlin and Hagar, provided it is safe to do so.</p>

Please refer to the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/parking-map.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1706137749039000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2G9RrndauItpBSK12nLEeG" href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/parking-map.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campus map</a> for other stops around campus.</p>
<p>The Disability Van Service and Safe Ride will continue to serve all areas of campus to the extent feasible.</p>
<p>All transit passengers should expect delays during this closure.</p>
<h2>Parking</h2>
<p>The East Remote Parking Lot will remain open and accessible from the south only. The following Parking Lots will not be accessible until further notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lot 103A (East Field House)</li>
<li>Lot 103B (Athletics and Recreation)</li>
<li>Lot 163 (Cowell Provost)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional impacts</h2>
<p>The closure of Hagar Road may increase traffic and congestion on other campus roads, particularly Coolidge Drive and Heller Drive. Members of the campus community should anticipate potential delays, and we encourage everyone to be patient and understanding.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Transportation and Parking Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3c89ab258072704660d5bcfda8d1e180"><name>aesthetic-of-resilience</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Institute of Arts and Sciences announces new interdisciplinary initiative on climate change</title><summary>A new multi-year initiative will bring together arts and science to start a conversation about marine biology and the effects of climate change.

He and Rachel Nelson, the director of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences (IAS), have teamed up to create an interdisciplinary project that shows the effects of climate change in California, especially in regards to marine life through both art and science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two met after Friedlaender collaborated with multimedia artist Yolande Harris, and Nelson invited them to speak. &#8220;I was really fascinated both by their processes of collaboration and the work that they were doing,&#8221; says Nelson, &#8220;I was also struck by the openness that Ari had to working with artists and how he was thinking about the roles art can play in communicating science research.&#8221; On meeting Nelson, Friedlaender describes being &#8220;shocked&#8221; to find out IAS existed: &#8220;as soon as I talked to Rachel, it was very clear to me that we were very much aligned in the ideas that we had.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their new project, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Aesthetic of Resilience</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is a multi-year initiative that will display research, artworks, and exhibitions starting in Spring 2025. Friedlaender and Nelson are hosting an event on January 24th where they will discuss their collaborative methods and the cultural shifts they are hoping will be a result of this initiative.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Aesthetic of Resilience</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will include three research projects in the Friedlaender Lab and art from nationally renowned artists. Collaborating artists include but are not limited to Imani Jacqueline Brown, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christine Howard Sandoval</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolina Caycedo. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The artists that we're working with are incredibly well trained in thinking about the aesthetic approaches to social justice issues,&#8221; says Nelson. Friedlaender also mentioned enjoying the conversations with the artists and watching their ideas begin to germinate during their collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Drs. Friedlaender and Nelson emphasize that the art will not be scientific drawings, diagrams, or direct depictions of the research, but that the science and art will be in constant communication with each other. &#8220;I'm just grateful to be able to be part of that process,&#8221; says Friedlaender. &#8220;As scientists, we have an opportunity to have these opinions and these voices impact how we actually do things, we can adjust or modify or direct our science based on the kinds of questions that the artists are going to be asking of us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the desire to put art and science in communication, was to broaden the scope and perspective of the research and to emphasize how climate change intersects with forms of social inequity. This is in part to emphasize the people who are often the most impacted by the effects of climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Aesthetic of Resilience</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes mostly from the California Climate Action Seed Grant. This $2 million in funding comes as part of the $80 million of grant money going to University of California schools. &#8220;I want to send an acknowledgement to the folks that are funding these projects, who saw the vision that Rachel and I had for this,&#8221; says Friedlaender. &#8220;[They understood that] this is a valuable thing to pursue..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both are excited for this unique interdisciplinary project that embodies what the IAS was created for. &#8220;Some of the solutions to climate change are going to come from scientific research,&#8221; says Nelson. &#8220;But it is clear that narrative and cultural shifts are also necessary. The arts can be a vital part of leading the cultural changes we need.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3d525389807270463907a9e6d944386c"><name>neh-awards-2024</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>National Endowment for the Humanities gives $60,000 award to two UCSC faculty members</title><summary>The National Endowment for the Humanities included two UC Santa Cruz professors in their most recent round of grants and awards.

Of the 260 humanities projects included are two UC Santa Cruz professors: <a href="https://history.ucsc.edu/faculty/profiles/index.php?uid=jderr">Jennifer Derr</a>, an associate professor of history, and <a href="https://havc.ucsc.edu/faculty/stacy-l-kamehiro">Stacy Kamehiro</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an associate professor of history of art and visual culture. Both professors are receiving $60,000 thanks to their individual projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These awards come as part of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Tapestry: Weaving Together Past, Present, and Future </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiative. The initiative takes inspiration from the founding legislation of NEH which states it is searching for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.&#8221; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Tapestry </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">focuses on issues of diversity and democracy to advance equity in our country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the hope of NEH Chair Shelly C. Lowe that &#8220;This funding will help preserve and expand access to community histories, strengthen the ability of small museums and archives to serve the public, and provide resources and educational opportunities for students to engage with history, literature, languages, and cultures.&#8221; Projects receiving awards and funding around the country include but are not limited to: a Kansas initiative to collect oral history of Spanish-speaking and Indigenous communities about the effects of the pandemic; a machine learning project aiming at enhancing access to photography by using resources from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston Globe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and a CSU Northridge project to transcribe and archive documented experiences of people of color in the 18th through 20th centuries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Jennifer Derr&#8217;s award comes from one of NEH&#8217;s 30 Awards for faculty for her most recent research into liver disease in Egypt. Her project </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Organ that Traveled the World: Medicine, Capitalism, and the History of Liver Disease in Egypt </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">looks at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">intersection of the histories of science, medicine, environmentalism, and capitalism to understand increased rates of Hepatitis C in Egypt.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I'm thrilled that Jennifer Derr has been awarded this prestigious NEH Fellowship!&#8221; says Jasmine Alinder, the Dean of Humanities. &#8220;Her work represents the kind of truly interdisciplinary scholarship that the Humanities Division at UCSC aims to foster."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derr recently wrapped up her research and plans on using the award money to help finance her as she spends the next three or four years writing. When finished this will be her second book. Her first, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lived Nile</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2019), investigates the construction of the first dam on the Nile as a &#8220;manifestation of colonial economy in Egypt [with an interest] in how patterns of environmental disease shifted as a result of the construction of that dam&#8221; she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her new work picks up where the last book left off, especially in terms of her early research on how treatments campaigns by the Egyptian Ministry of Public Health caused </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schistosomiasis and Hepatitis C which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led to liver disease. Derr uses this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigate and think about the relationship between global public health and a broader capitalist world economy, and how medicine was shaped by that relationship,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I'm very excited about this book, because it gives me a devoted opportunity to think about how medicine within a capitalist world has come to be and what its limitations are, what its strengths have been, and how we should think about that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor&#160;</span>Stacy Kamehiro&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">received part of the $4.7 million in fellowship funding for her work on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Objects of the Nation: Hawai&#8217;i at the World&#8217;s Fairs, 1855&#8211;1899</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Her research and writing reflect how representation at the world&#8217;s fair reflected indigenous sovereignty and Hawiian nationhood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This very competitive and prestigious award from the NEH recognizes the outstanding work of Professor Kamehiro regarding indigenous cultures, particularly&#160; Hawaiian visual and material culture,&#8221; said Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu, Dean of the Arts Division and Distinguished Professor of Film and Media at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;The entire Arts Division community celebrates this great honor.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guided by the belief that philosophy can be a force for positive change, the CPP,&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;which is housed at&#160;<span class="il">Cowell</span><span> College and was created in collaboration with The Humanitiies Institute at UCSC,&#160;</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeks to share the joy of philosophy beyond the confines of higher education through community outreach and public events.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CPP&#8217;s programs range far and wide, from running an Ethics Bowl program at San Quentin prison to leading philosophy programs in elementary schools. The Center has developed animations and other media about thinking and reasoning, including recently the "TEQ Deck: Technology. Ethics. Questions" for use in assorted curricular and public modalities, a collaboration with the Baskin School of Engineering.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it is their </span><a href="https://publicphilosophy.ucsc.edu/ethics-bowl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outreach Invitational High School Ethics Bowl</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program that has recently garnered national recognition, and in 2023 received the Prize for Excellence and Innovation in Philosophy Programs from the American Philosophical Association and the Philosophy Documentation Center.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The award recognizes </span><a href="https://www.apaonline.org/page/apa_pdc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">organizations &#8220;for creating programs that risk undertaking new initiatives in philosophy and do so with excellence and success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; It was presented to CPP on January 16 in New York City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Outreach Invitational came out of CPP&#8217;s experience with the regional and national High School Ethics Bowl (HSEB), where it became clear that most of the participating schools were well-resourced. The Center decided to develop a program to bring the Ethics Bowl to under-served high schools that &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.apaonline.org/page/2023prizes-s#PDC"><span style="font-weight: 400;">would not otherwise have the resources or coaching to experience the special form of collaborative debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethics Bowl is an alternative form of debate activity, which serves as a kind of counter-programming to traditional high school debate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In traditional debate, competition teams are assigned to defend one side of an issue at random, whether they agree with the position or not. Associate Professor of Philosophy Jonathan Ellis, who founded the Center for Public Philosophy in 2015, observed in a</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New York Times </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">editorial co-written with Francesca Hovagimian (B.A. philosophy, 2017): &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/opinion/sunday/school-debate-politics.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is not to determine the most reasonable or fair-minded approach to an issue, but to defend a given claim at all costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In placing persuasion ahead of inquiry and understanding, traditional debate fortifies habits of reasoning that serve primarily to defend the conclusion one wants to reach, Ellis and Hovagimian argue. In contrast, the structure of the Ethics Bowl rewards meaningful listening and the disposition of an open mind in contexts of disagreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lorenzo Barranco, the English Language Development Department Chair at Alisal High School and long-time Ethics Bowl coach, spoke of the impact of the Outreach Invitational Ethics Bowl in particular: &#8220;The UCSC Invitational Ethics Bowl has opened up opportunities for my students to participate in an academically rigorous debate that helped them grow personally and as 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century students delving into contemporary issues,&#8221; Barranco said. &#8220;The Invitational is an enriching opportunity to learn the rigors of debate and the need to articulate one's ideas clearly in the context of collaborative teamwork while being receptive to other ideas. Many of my students have shared that the Invitational was a milestone moment in their high school years.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three especially innovative features of the prize-winning program CPP created. The first is the role that undergraduate students from UCSC play.&#160; CPP trains select students, many of them drawn from the college Ethics Bowl team, to serve as coaches at the schools. For eight to 10 weeks, the undergraduates, and sometimes also graduate students,&#160; visit the high school to which they've been assigned to work with the teams in preparation for the culminating Outreach Invitational on the UCSC campus in April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another distinctive feature of the CPP program is its Spanish track. In 2019, Juan Ruiz (MA, philosophy, 2019) &#8211; who created the Outreach Invitational with Jon Ellis and Kyle Robertson (lecturer in Philosophy and Politics, who runs the regional HSEB event and coaches the undergraduate Ethics Bowl team) &#8211;&#160; &#8211; noticed that many students at the schools where he was coaching were intrigued by the Ethics Bowl.&#160; Yet the idea of participating in their second language in an already difficult activity kept them from signing up.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Ruiz, who is now a PhD student in Latin American and Latino Studies, spearheaded the creation of a Spanish-only track, in which students, coaches, and judges participate throughout in Spanish. &#8220;Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e Outreach Bilingual Invitational represents a horizon of possibilities to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nurture equity, diversity, and inclusion in higher education with students from communities not included in our transformative platforms,&#8221; Ruiz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marian Avila Breach (Cowell &#8217;20, politics and philosophy), who is now in her second year as a J.D Candidate and Public Interest Scholar at UC Berkeley Law School, was central to building the Spanish track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a Spanish Ethics Bowl coach, I enjoyed going back and forth with my team, trying to find the words to express already difficult philosophical concepts and ideas,&#8221; Breach said. &#8220;Part of what I discovered is that Spanish allowed me a space for greater philosophical expression, as I was able to give shape to concepts that were natural to Spanish, but uncommon or less intuitive in English.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there are the judges. Unlike traditional forms of school debate, judges in the Ethics Bowl are more like discussion participants who engage with the teams on their arguments, participating in the inquiry themselves. That makes all parties involved in the Ethics Bowl committed to engaging in substantive but collaborative dialogue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellis describes how everyone works in tandem on the day of the event to make it so memorable:&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have this incredible forum of groups coming together on the day of the event. Judges are drawn from the community&#8212;from medicine, local politics, industry, non-profits&#8212;along with faculty from across campus, along with undergraduate students and graduate student coaches. All of them join the high school students and one another to discuss difficult issues, but in a mode where everyone's trying explicitly to practice real intellectual hospitality.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The low-stakes competition offers students from under-resourced schools an empowering and eye-opening experience on a college campus, making a university education feel both personally meaningful and accessible.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcia Ochoa, provost of Oakes College and Associate Professor of Theater Arts, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, has served as a judge in the Spanish track since its start and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offered this observation:&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Latin America, when someone comes to your house, to tell them they're always welcome back, you say &#8216;ya conoces el camino&#8217; &#8211; now you know the way here,&#8221; Ochoa said. &#8220;The bilingual Invitational Ethics Bowl does important work to build relationships with surrounding communities, welcoming Latinx students, parents, and teachers to our campus and letting them know we belong here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The award for Innovation and Excellence is another testament to UCSC&#8217;s identity and commitment as a </span><a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Hispanic Serving Institution.&#160;</span></a></p>

Healthy forests help in the fight against climate change by absorbing some of our excess carbon dioxide emissions, and they can provide wildlife habitat and quality-of-life benefits for local human communities too. So why not plant more trees? It seems like an easy win.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the problem is, there&#8217;s a huge difference between simply planting a tree and making sure that trees survive and grow over the long-term. And without the necessary ecological understanding or long-term planning and follow-up that goes into successful reforestation projects, tree-planting efforts can end up being useless, wasteful, or even actively harmful to people and the planet.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why restoration ecologists, like UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies Professor Karen Holl, have been working to educate tree-planting organizations and the public about best practices for successful reforestation. The </span><a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.13002"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Holl&#8217;s research team set out to examine the possible impact of those education efforts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the common problems is that organizations will just say, &#8216;We're going to put this many trees in the ground,&#8217; but the important question is, &#8216;What comes afterward?&#8217;,&#8221; Holl said. &#8220;There are many documented failures from tree-planting campaigns, so we would hope to see organizations improving their practices and taking on more accountability, including through publicly reporting data.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To examine these issues, UCSC postdoctoral researcher Spencer Schubert led an analysis of publicly available web content for 99 organizations that coordinate large-scale tree-planting programs around the globe. The research team, which included three undergraduates and one graduate student from UCSC, rated each organization based on how well their public information demonstrated a commitment to best practices.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We reviewed websites as well as annual reports and other linked documents to really get a broad view of the information that organizations reveal to the public,&#8221; Schubert said. &#8220;We wanted to focus on how transparent organizations are about their practices, because that&#8217;s what allows potential donors or investors to evaluate what these organizations are promising.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, researchers rated the organizations against a set of </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/04/tree-planting-funding-questions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> established by Holl&#8217;s prior work. Those guidelines focus on community engagement, addressing underlying causes of deforestation, preventing unintended harms, and committing to long-term management and monitoring of projects. The more specific an organization was about their goals and demonstrating their impacts in these areas, the higher they were rated.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers compared the findings of their analysis with those of prior research to see how trends in application of best practices have changed over time. One improvement area was community involvement, which critics have often called out as a missing element. The team&#8217;s analysis showed that 91% of organizations now recognize community involvement as a key component of successful reforestation, and almost all organizations discussed benefits that their projects would provide to local communities. However only 38% of organizations actually reported data demonstrating how communities benefited from projects.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, 78% of organizations successfully provided information about specific drivers of deforestation in their working regions, and 75% of those discussed how they would address these issues. The study showed some positive progress around monitoring of projects. A </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721002767"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had previously found that only 18% of organizations mentioned monitoring on their websites, but in the current study, that measure had risen to 70%.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, only 41% of organizations actually reported data on tree survival rates, and 61% of all organizations failed to specify how long projects would be maintained, monitored, or financed. Only 10% of organizations mentioned required commitments to their projects beyond 10 years. And only 19% discussed any potential negative consequences of tree planting, although those that did also presented strategies to avoid those issues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Overall, there are still many gaps in the details and data that we&#8217;re seeing,&#8221; Schubert said. &#8220;That and the general lack of clarity about long-term management, financing, and protection for these projects raises some serious concerns. This doesn't necessarily mean that reforestation is not being successful, but there is a lot of uncertainty about whether these emerging global tree growing efforts will achieve their desired long-term benefits.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holl said she did find it heartening that some organizations are clearly beginning to pay more attention to recommendations from the scientific community, and she hopes that trend will continue.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Things are moving in the right direction with some of these organizations,&#8221; Holl said. &#8220;The next step they&#8217;ll need to take is to go beyond generalities and be more specific about how they&#8217;re going to implement best practices, including making longer term commitments and focusing on data collection to back up what they&#8217;re saying they're going to do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By deepening their focus on improving practices, tree-planting organizations and their supporters will have the best possible chance of achieving positive impact and avoiding unintended consequences.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

400;">UC Santa Cruz is now providing expanded services to faculty, staff, and students traveling internationally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Price, Global Travel Security Manager, was hired last year in the Division of Global Engagement. This new position provides assistance with pre-travel preparation as well as support while abroad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price&#8217;s focus is on anticipating potential risks specific to location and activity type, and developing risk mitigation plans, faculty briefings, and expanded educational resources for students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a university with a global footprint and growing portfolio of international agreements, it is vital that international travel for faculty, staff, and students is a secure, safe, and supported process,&#8221; said Michael Price, Global Travel Security Manager at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Implementing simple and convenient travel safety plans will also help provide beneficial learning and research experiences for everyone at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the simplest ways to gain access to travel resources and support is to register your travel, as required by UC Santa Cruz for all university business-related travel and outlined in the </span><a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/international-travel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Travel section</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Global Engagement website. Registering travel is a quick and simple process that provides many benefits to travelers, including location-specific alerts for safe and reliable travel, access to travel insurance and emergency contact information, and timely assistance in the event of a crisis, including emergency evacuation if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus community is encouraged to become familiar with the important travel resources available at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>

The 16-week extracurricular training program takes place in the Winter and Spring quarters. Unlike previous years, the program has two tracks this year: general and agriculture. Altogether, the cohort has 40 students, of whom 17 focus on agriculture-related drone use and 23 on the broad use of drones. The program is for UC Santa Cruz undergraduate students, regardless of their major. This year, there is also one auditing graduate student participating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first eight weeks of the program focus on training the students to obtain FAA commercial drone pilot licenses. To gain the license, students will study a broad range of aviation topics and regulations and complete a written exam at an FAA facility, the closest one being the Watsonville Airport. After the Winter quarter, among other topics, the students will master the federal drone regulations, be able to read aeronautical charts, understand the limitations of different types of airspace for drone operations, and, most importantly, how to operate drones safely and responsibly. Besides the content required to learn for the FAA exam, the program focuses on three essential aspects of drone use: safety, privacy, and security. The students will also get their first flight experience during the Winter quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spring quarter is project-based, and each student works in a small group to complete a drone operation project. These projects include inspecting solar panels, identifying the health of crops, assessing crop damage after storms or droughts, inspecting greenhouses, and more. In order to complete the projects, students learn to use data processing and analysis software commonly used in the drone industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz CIDER was founded in 2021, and the first Drone Pilot Training Program cohort started in 2022. The program has changed its form slightly every year as the CIDER team has modified it to be more engaging and hands-on. The core idea of CIDER and the Drone Pilot Training Program is to increase and support DEI in the drone industry, along with training responsible drone pilots who are aware of safety, privacy, and security when flying drones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to running the Drone Pilot Training Program, CIDER works with other educational organizations in the community, including Hartnell College and Digital Nest, to train their instructors and support their drone program curriculum development.

The program, co-sponsored by the </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Social Transformation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, supports cross-disciplinary student projects and events focused on exploring technology-based solutions to significant social challenges. Student teams can receive up to $5,000 for research projects and up to $1,000 for events and is open to undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students across all campus disciplines and divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this year&#8217;s program, three innovative teams were selected for the technology development track.&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mobile App for Interaction with an Electric Tractor project team is developing a mobile application control system for Amiga, a small and adjustable electric tractor used at the UC Santa Cruz CASFS farm. Amiga was developed by Farm-ng to automate manual tasks, receive real-time updates, and minimize maintenance and fuel expenses at farms. The team aims to mitigate challenges currently faced in a more traditional agricultural approach: labor-intensive tasks, time-consuming processes, and excessive use of pesticides resulting in workforce shortage, increased operational costs, unsafe working environments, and reduced efficiency. The mobile device can reduce the physical intensity of farm work, allow two farmers to manage the tractor cooperatively, enhance the tractor&#8217;s control and safety, and give farmers the ability to repair and maintain their equipment. The application will also be integrated into organic farming.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gateways Digital Literacy Classes project team focuses on providing digital design skills to incarcerated people to improve their opportunities as they are reintegrated into society, aiming to reduce recidivism. It also increases community engagement among those currently incarcerated. The project is implemented in two Santa Cruz County facilities. The curriculum covers topics including Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and Rush, with integrated personal development and interpersonal communication.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Greener Greenhouses project team is developing an ultra-low power open-source sensor to provide a more affordable, less energy-demanding, and less human intervention-requiring monitoring system for greenhouses. Greenhouses equipped with sensors can use less water, fertilizer, and lighting, increasing crop yield efficiency. The team&#8217;s goal is to reduce the financial barrier that greenhouse operators face in adopting &#8220;smart agriculture&#8221; techniques to minimize resource wastage. Releasing the work as open-source ensures that those needing low-cost agricultural sensing the most can reach the technology.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CITRIS will organize a Student Project Showcase at the end of the Spring semester of 2024, where the three teams will present their progress. The event will be open to anyone interested.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute create information technology solutions for society&#8217;s most pressing challenges. Established in 2001, the center leverages the interdisciplinary research strengths of multiple Campuses &#8211; Berkeley, Davis, Merced, and Santa Cruz &#8211; along with public and private partners to advance the University of California&#8217;s mission and the innovative spirit of California. The institute was created to shorten the pipeline between world-class laboratory research and the development of cutting-edge applications, platforms, companies, and even new industries.

The mighty redwoods, the iconic banana slug, the small sorrel are all interwoven in their existence and survival.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Favianna Rodriguez&#8217;s solo exhibition at the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery, &#8220;Power From The Roots,'' draws parallels between the interconnectedness of the redwood ecosystem and principles of mutual aid. This concept, people coming together with shared responsibility and respect to address common challenges, resonates throughout Rodriguez&#8217;s work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Oakland-based artist and activist, Rodiguez is renowned for her impactful social justice posters. In &#8220;Power from the Roots,&#8221; she illuminates the deep connections between critical social issues&#8211;climate change, migration, gender justice, racial equity&#8211;and the ecological landscape that we share with our more-than-human neighbors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibition, which opened on January 9 and will run until March 9, is thematically organized around portraits of local species of plants and animals alongside activist posters. Rodriguez&#8217;s iconic image of a monarch butterfly is displayed next to migrant justice posters, while her portrait of a coho salmon is positioned alongside decolonization and food justice posters. The arrangement exemplifies the exhibition's theme of exploring activism from the roots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martabel Wasserman, the curator of the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery this year, emphasized the unique connections Rodriguez draws between activism and the environment. Wasserman explained, &#8220;Power from the roots refers to the idea of understanding power on a systemic level &#8230; It's easy to feel overwhelmed and hopeless as we're facing so many interlocking systemic crises. I think what's inspiring about this show is to see the important role art can play in social movements and the ripple effects of just one person expressing themselves.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibition also highlights the gallery's commitment to student involvement. Chancellor's Undergraduate Intern (CUI), Malia Reid, a third-year History of Art and Visual Culture major, played an important role in exhibition planning. Reid's efforts </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rvK-Y1MWxyLBtmp-vqw9GqRvi2wtyoXu/view?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">culminated in a Zine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that provides a connection between the artwork and different themes. She described the Zine as "another way for students to engage with the story behind the work."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid explained, "It&#8217;s beautiful how [Favianna] turns these very complex and important issues into a full body of beautiful graphics and art. Through the art form, students are able to confront topics that are more difficult and challenging to deal with. I feel very lucky that we have this space where we can get these ideas out to students in a visual way."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the gallery has been turned into a makerspace during the exhibition, and Reid leads an art workshop for students every Friday to explore themes and tools used by Rodriguez in her work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 1966 at Cowell College, The Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery has a long history combining art, activism, and education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The art that we promote goes beyond the gallery and goes beyond being just a visual space,&#8221; said Shelly Grabe, associate provost at Cowell College. &#8220;We try to make it multidisciplinary and help students understand the social topics that are being taken up through the art.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The namesake of the gallery, Eloise Pickard Smith, was an artist and founder of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Prisons Arts Project who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">felt art could contribute to social change. In honor of its founder, the gallery is hosting a year-long sequence on art activism, focused on women activists and artists.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Favianna is an artist who works doggedly on issues related to inequity,&#8221; explained Grabe. &#8220;She is a brilliant, truth-telling powerhouse. There's so much integrity in her, lining up with her values and the contribution she wants to make in the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodriguez will provide insights into her decade-long artistic journey and activism during an </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/power_from_the_roots_in_conversation_with_favianna_rodriguez"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artist Talk on February 7, 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 4 to 6 p.m. at the Stevenson Event Center, Stevenson College.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Favianna is really an amazing example of someone who hasn't compromised her message and has been able to build a career as an artist,&#8221; emphasized Wasserman. &#8220;Being able to hear from someone who's done that is an inspiring opportunity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibition, artist talk, and related events at the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery offer a unique opportunity for the entire UC Santa Cruz community to explore the roots of critical social and environmental issues and be inspired by the catalytic power of art towards the social good.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Highlights &amp; Key Dates:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Housing Info Sessions: <strong>Feb. 5&#8211;9</strong></li>
<li>Housing Application Period: <strong>Feb. 26 &#8211; March 4</strong></li>
<li>Room Selection Lottery: <strong>April 9&#8211;18</strong></li>
<li>Housing Waitlist Information</li>
<li>Community Rentals: Off-campus housing resources</li>
<li>Open office hours</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Attend a Housing Info Session: Feb. 5&#8211;9</strong></h2>
<p>Plan to attend a <a href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/continuing/info-sessions.html">housing information session</a> during the week of Feb. 5&#8211;9 to learn more about housing options and the Room Selection Lottery.</p>
<h2><strong>Housing Application Period: Feb. 26 &#8211; March 4</strong></h2>
<p>To be eligible for the Room Selection Lottery,&#160;students currently living in university housing must reapply for housing during the housing application period, which opens Feb. 26 and closes March 4. Understanding your options and the Room Selection Lottery process can help you decide which college/community to choose on your application. For example, if you would like to form a group with friends you hope to live with, you must all apply to the same community.</p>
<h2><strong>What's new this year?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>We are changing from a priority-based system to a lottery system. All continuing students living in university housing during Winter &amp; Spring 2024 who apply during the application period will be in the lottery.</li>
<li>The application period and room selection process are being held six weeks earlier. This means students can know sooner if they&#8217;ve secured on-campus housing or if they are on a waitlist and need to consider off-campus options.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What&#8217;s staying the same?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Before the Room Selection Lottery, housing staff will assign students with DRC accommodations, students accepted into campuswide theme housing or the Camper Park, and Resident Assistants (RA) and Neighborhood Assistants (NA).</li>
<li>The 2024-25 Room Selection Lottery will take place in a series of passes. Randomly generated lottery times will be emailed to participating students in advance of each pass.<em>&#160;</em></li>
<li>Roommate groups who can completely fill a space (a full apartment or a residence hall room) and students who apply to live at their affiliated college will have the earliest opportunity to select a space.</li>
<li>The housing lottery is based on availability at the time a student logs in, with spaces becoming more limited as other students complete their selections. Unfortunately, space availability is not certain, and some students will not be able to make a selection during the lottery.</li>
<li><strong>Important: </strong>If you have a disability-related housing need, you must submit a Housing Accommodation Request in addition to completing a housing application. Visit <a href="http://drc.ucsc.edu">drc.ucsc.edu</a> for information. A new accommodation request is needed each year.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Housing Waitlist:</strong></h2>
<p>After the lottery, any student who did not secure housing during the lottery (or was not eligible to participate in the lottery) will be on the housing waitlist. Additionally, any late applications will be placed on the waitlist.</p>
<p>A small number of housing spaces may become available as cancellations occur, though we cannot predict when or how many. When a space becomes available it will immediately be reassigned to a student from the waitlist. While housing staff work throughout spring and summer to accommodate as many students as possible, all students on the waitlist are strongly encouraged to also pursue off-campus housing.</p>
<h3><strong>Waitlist management</strong></h3>
<p>Housing Coordinators will first work to assign any waitlisted <a href="https://renaissancescholars.ucsc.edu/who-we-are/index.html">Renaissance Scholars</a>, <a href="https://financialaid.ucsc.edu/types-of-aid/scholarships/ucsc_merit_scholarships.html">Regent Scholars</a>, and students with <a href="https://drc.ucsc.edu/accommodations/">disability-related accommodations</a> issued by the Disability Resource Center (DRC). Additional students will be assigned on a space-available basis.</p>
<h2><strong>Community Rentals: Off-campus housing resources</strong></h2>
<p>If you are considering living off-campus next year, it&#8217;s never too early to start planning your search. Here are a few important first steps you can take now:</p>
<p><strong>Renters Workshop:&#160;</strong>Take the online <a href="https://communityrentals.ucsc.edu/renters-workshop/index.html">Renters Workshop</a> and receive a Certificate of Completion to show landlords you are a knowledgeable prospective tenant.</p>
<p><strong>Networking:&#160;</strong>Think about who you want to live with, and start networking. You never know who will have information about a place to rent unless you ask, so cast a wide net! You could also meet a potential housemate or group to search with.</p>
<p><strong>Places4Students:&#160;</strong>Familiarize yourself with <a href="https://communityrentals.ucsc.edu/search-rentals/index.html">Places4Students</a>, UCSC&#8217;s rental listings partner.

He will be performing with Nitin Mitta, an internationally recognized tabla player. Both musicians are cornerstones of Indian classical music, who have brought their talents all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The performance is funded by the Kamil and Talat Hasan Endowed Chair for Classic Indian Music, Dard Neuman, and by the Ali Akbar Khan Endowment for Classical Music. It is also co-sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Center for South Asian Studies. UC Santa Cruz puts a heavy emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion, and is happy to welcome performers and audiences from diverse backgrounds to be present and included on campus.</span></p>
<p><strong>Ustad Nishat Khan</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khan is part of one of the most highly regarded musical families in India. The Khan family has been contributing to classical Indian music professionally for seven generations. Nishat started learning to play at the age of three and made his first public debut at seven. He went international by age 17 playing at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nishat draws on his own musical heritage in the North Indian classical idiom and engages in other genres including jazz, Flamenco and Gregorian chant. He has worked with other major performers and composers such as John McLaughlin, Philip Glass, Paco Pe&#241;a and Evelyn Glennie among many others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nishat stands at the threshold of the future of sitar and Indian music with his uniquely invigorating and contemporary approach. He is one of India&#8217;s finest musicians and a virtuoso sitar player, transcending musical barriers with his provocative expression and spellbinding technical mastery.</span></p>
<p><strong>Nitin Mitta</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nitin is one of the most sought-after tabla players of his generation. He has performed with many of the top notch Indian Classical Musicians worldwide. He has also collaborated with Grammy-nominated pianist Vijay Iyer and Carnatic electric guitarist R. Prasanna to produce their album titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tirtha</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nitin&#8217;s gurus, Pandit G.Satyanarayana and Pandit Arvind Mulgaonkar, were disciples of Ustad Amir Hussain Khan, Nishat Khan&#8217;s father. Nitin has been mentoring many young tabla enthusiasts and also teaches Tabla at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Nitin has performed at the Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, at Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</span></p>

says assistant professor of music </span><a href="https://music.ucsc.edu/people/russell-rodriguez"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russell Rodriguez</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> speaking about the Am&#233;rico the Paredes Prize which he won in 2023. The prize was given by the </span><a href="https://americanfolkloresociety.org/our-work/prizes/americo-paredes-prize/#:&#126;:text=Each%20year%2C%20the%20AFS%20Committee,communities%20one%20studies%2C%20or%20in"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Folklore Society</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reward scholars who invest in studying folklore and expanding cultural traditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This award was named for journalist and scholar </span><a href="http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/benson/paredes/biography.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Am&#233;rico Paredes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who spent his life living in Texas along the Mexico border. His work focused largely on the experiences of Mexican-Americans especially when it came to cultural heritage and traditions of folklore. The Paredes Prize aims to honor those whose work is cross-disciplinary, socially engaged, and fosters work in their community or culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodriguez has worked both with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of California, Santa Cruz</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campus and the surrounding communities on projects that carry on the legacy of Chicanx arts traditions. He has helped compose music for local community theaters and worked with local Mariachi bands. &#8220;I did a lot of community work as a musician and I grew up working as a dancer and a musician,&#8221; says Rodriquez. &#8220;I would be at all the Chicano protests and rallies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodriguez also found the Mariachi band on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campus which he formed in 2018.&#160; Though the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the work of the on-campus group he is excited to bring back performances, with an upcoming show on May 17th. Rodriguez also credits Dard Neuman, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hasan Endowed Chair in Classical Indian Music, for encouraging him when he first came to campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He grew up learning Mariachi music and sees it as community oriented. &#8220;Working in mariachi is seeing all these convivial spaces in which families celebrate. We will play weddings, baptism, and funerals. We've come to understand that we have a really specific role in these communities,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Music and intercultural expression are important, not for the sense of entertainment, but the sense of engagement and establishing collective memory.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodriguez is the 22nd winner of the Am&#233;rico the Paredes Prize which was established in 2002. He is the second winner from UC Santa Cruz after Olga N&#225;jera-Ram&#237;rez.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Russell is both an innovative scholar and a highly skilled musician who has acquired a deep and intimate knowledge of diverse cultural practices, particularly those of marginalized communities,&#8221; says the American Folklore Society when announcing Rodriguez as the prize winner. &#8220;His scope and depth of knowledge, talent, humor, and incredible modesty makes him an exceptional teacher, scholar, and colleague. His combination of theoretical sophistication and real-world engagement is especially inspiring and refreshing. As someone who has been a program manager for the Alliance for California for Traditional Arts, a scholar and teacher, and consultant and partner with the Smithsonian, and ever a practitioner, Russell&#8217;s distinguished academic performance is deeply connected to his community service, and well-deserving of the 2023 Paredes Prize."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5c601849807270460a4f76706d4b4c89"><name>leo-merle</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Crafting smiles and setting records on the track: An alumnus’s unique dual-pursuit</title><summary>Alumnus Leo Merle is juggling two major life goals: graduate from the University of Michigan with a doctorate in dentistry, and be the first American with cerebral palsy to run the 1,500 meter race in less than four minutes at the 2024 Paris Paralympics. </summary><start-date>1706727600000</start-date><display-name>leo-merle</display-name><path>/2024/01/leo-merle</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/01/leo-merle</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1706651818036</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1706731912837</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Haneen Zain</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/merle-lead1-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2024/merle-lead1-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>merle-lead1-1.jpg</name><display-name>merle-lead1-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>97932</file-size><width>450</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/merle-lead-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2024/merle-lead-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>merle-lead-1.jpg</name><display-name>merle-lead-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>17910</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Leo Merle (Rachel Carson &#8217;20, mollecular, cellular, and developmental biology) at the&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Parapan American Games.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/img_0550-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2024/img_0550-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>img_0550-1.jpg</name><display-name>img_0550-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>119111</file-size><width>450</width><height>292</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Leo Merle running for UC Santa Cruz as a student.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Leo Merle is months away from receiving his doctorate in dental surgery and is a candidate to represent Team USA at the 2024 Paris Paralympics</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leo Merle is on the fast track to achieving two significant life goals. One, graduate from the University of Michigan School of Dentistry with a doctorate of dental surgery (DDS). Two, be the first American with cerebral palsy to run the 1,500-meter race in less than four minutes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a recent </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/11/leo-merle.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gold medal win</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Team USA at the Parapan American Games, making him a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">candidate for the 2024 Paris Paralympic stage, and a graduation date set in May 2024, Merle is down to the wire.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;May 10, 2024, I will officially go from no doctor title to doctor title,&#8221; says Merle. &#8220;So I&#8217;ll enjoy that for a bit, bask in it, and then for three months entirely focus on running. I have a great chance to make the US team to go represent the US in Paris, and I want to give myself the maximum chance to do that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merle graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2020 with a B.S. in molecular, cellular, and developmental (MCD) biology and a rekindled passion for running. He had been running since the 6th grade, but when it came time to attend college, continuing the sport competitively wasn&#8217;t his biggest priority. He sought out UCSC for its reputation in the biological sciences and its unique campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The most important thing for me then was a good biology program and something coastal; those were the two big things. Santa Cruz really called my name.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, a connection between his high school coaches and a former UCSC track coach led Merle to try out for the university&#8217;s track team.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an athlete and MCD bio student, Merle recalls having consistent 15-hour days, waking up at 6:30 a.m. for track practice, having a day full of classes, labs, and studying, and then getting home around 9:30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t until he came across a series of YouTube videos of para-athletic track races from the 2012 London Paralympics Games that Merle realized he could potentially compete in a class with other athletes that had a similar level of cerebral palsy as he does.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was like, &#8216;Wait a minute, some of these guys are running like I do,&#8217; and then I totally fell down this rabbit hole of researching the whole thing,&#8221; Merle recalled. &#8220;I was looking at the US Para Athletics, the Paralympics, and the World Para Athletic Committee, and I realized this seems reasonable; this doesn&#8217;t seem like a far-fetched idea.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fairness in para-sport, athletes are placed in classifications of like-ability to ensure a level playing field and strong competition. These classifications include wheelchair users, short stature, amputee&#8217;s, visual, mental and physical impairment. Merle and his level of cerebral palsy place him under the physical impairment category as part of a classification of high functioning individuals with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and/or cerebral palsy (CP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his third year at Santa Cruz, Merle competed in his first-ever competition as a para-athlete in the 2019 U23 U.S. Nationals. At this event he went on to set the U23 U.S. record for the 5K among T38 athletes, that high functioning TBI/CP classification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natalie Marquardt, a former teammate of Merle at UCSC and a current assistant track coach, says the team is always excited to hear about Merle&#8217;s pursuits.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Leo is a really great representative of our track program,&#8221; Marquardt said. &#8220;Every time he does something incredible, we&#8217;re all very proud of him.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Merle can hit his current goal&#8212;being the first American with cerebral palsy to run the 1,500-meter race in less than four minutes&#8212;he will set another national record and become the second individual with cerebral palsy in the world to do so.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Path to dentistry&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merle grew up in Folsom, California, with an affinity for the arts. He played multiple instruments, participated in musicals, painted, and sculpted with clay. When he was in high school, he began to grow a deeper passion for the sciences, and biology in particular. Merle didn&#8217;t always know that he wanted to pursue dentistry, but after a summer shadowing a dentist in his hometown, Merle noticed the similarities between the field and art.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Art has always been a cornerstone growing up and was a big part of my upbringing along with science,&#8221; Merle said. &#8220;And so, once I found dentistry, it was this interesting hybrid between science and art. Cavities need to be filled, people want their teeth to look different, or they want them bleached,. And so it felt like this nice combination of treating somebody as a medical professional and allowing the artist inside to flair a little bit.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from the University of Michigan School of Dentistry and committing the following three months to running, Merle plans to transition into becoming a dental professional. He wants to specialize in endodontics and will be a root canal specialist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nearly 65 percent of dental emergencies are tooth pain. So, this is the kind of field of dentistry where you can potentially solve that. I would be able to treat the large majority of those emergencies that come in through the door.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merle plans to return to California and says Santa Cruz will always hold a special place in his heart&#8212;especially the view of the Monterey Bay from the UCSC campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;d wake up in the morning, go up to the field house, and the sun was coming over the horizon, illuminating the bay. You can see the Monterey mountains, and everything was pristinely clear on some of those mornings, and you could see the reflection of the light hitting the ocean sometimes. It was an absolutely pristine orange glow. It&#8217;s completely locked in my brain.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5ca1c7e8807270460ccbe83f6568eb3e"><name>upcoming-storms</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Preparing for storms on Wednesday and Thursday</title><summary>Over the coming days, we expect a major winter storm to affect Santa Cruz County alongside much of California.</summary><start-date>1706601600000</start-date><display-name>Preparing for storms on Wednesday and Thursday</display-name><path>/2024/01/upcoming-storms</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/01/upcoming-storms</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1706656122814</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1706656122814</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>Over the coming days, we expect a major winter storm to affect Santa Cruz County alongside much of California.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iskander is the featured speaker at this year&#8217;s edition of the</span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/projects/peggy-downs-baskin-ethics-lecture-series/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#160; a lively forum for the discussion and exploration of ethics-related challenges in human endeavors. The talk, entitled </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/peggy-downes-baskin-ethics-lecture-with-maryana-iskander/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Humans In The Loop: Wikipedia&#8217;s Future In The Age Of AI,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; is scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday, February 22 at the Cowell Hay Barn. &#160;the event is co-sponsored by <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu">The Humanities Institute </a>at the University of California, Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hosts Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, created, edited, and verified by volunteers around the world, known informally as Wikipedians. Wikipedia is one of the world&#8217;s most visited websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iskander&#8217;s talk will explore the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">role that humans play in shaping the future of the internet, especially given the meteoric rise of generative artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wikipedia is tech-enabled, but with human beings at the helm of this massive enterprise.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each month, it receives more than 15 billion visits as people search for information online. Iskander will share more about how Wikipedia is doubling down on humans in a world of machine-generated content. This talk is a chance to learn more about how people should be preparing for the future of knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Wikipedia is a unique example of how a human-led, technology-enabled platform can increase access, opportunity and knowledge,&#8221; Iskander said. &#8220;The use of AI is one of the biggest questions of our time, and I believe that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">disciplines like history, philosophy, linguistics, literature, art and others can add to our understanding of how technology is shaping the human experience, and how we can harness its potential. I look forward to using this talk to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">explore key lessons we have learned from Wikipedia about how to design a human-led approach to artificial intelligence."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethics Lecture is made possible by the </span><a href="https://humanities.ucsc.edu/giving/endowments/downesbaskin.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peggy Downes Baskin Humanities Endowment for Interdisciplinary Ethics </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which enables the Humanities Division to promote a dialogue about ethics and ethics-related challenges in an interdisciplinary setting.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The endowment was established in honor of Peggy Downes Baskin&#8217;s longtime interest in ethical issues across the academic spectrum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peggy Downes Baskin was a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n educator and scholar, advocate for women&#8217;s rights, and longtime philanthropic supporter of UC Santa Cruz. She died at her home surrounded by her family on Dec. 11, 2023. She was 93.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baskin was renowned for her courage and generosity of spirit. She supported and advanced UC Santa Cruz in numerous ways. She shared her expertise with students as a senior lecturer in Feminist Studies and supported efforts to promote a diverse and inclusive expansion of opportunities in STEM fields and increase educational equity in the Monterey Bay region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lecture series, now in its 14th year, has drawn many luminaries to speak on and off campus in Santa Cruz, including </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/toni-morrison/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toni Morrison, </span></a><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/projects/peggy-downs-baskin-ethics-lecture-series/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fania Davis, </span></a><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/jaron-lanier-how-the-internet-failed-and-how-to-recreate-it/?_sft_category=event-archive"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jaron Lanier, UCSC alumnus Ezra Klein, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;and the philosopher</span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/agnes-callard-inquisitive-politics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Agnes Callard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year&#8217;s speaker was </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/joy-connolly-the-peggy-downes-baskin-ethics-lecture/?_sft_category=event-archive"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joy Connolly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, president of the American Council Of Learned Societies.
