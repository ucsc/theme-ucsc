<p>The new ORU status coincides with the move of the Genomics Institute&#8217;s headquarters over the summer to renovated office and laboratory space in the campus-owned complex at 2300 Delaware Ave. on the west side of Santa Cruz. The Delaware Ave. site now hosts about 80 of the institute&#8217;s researchers and technical and administrative staff.</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s genomics researchers are nationally and internationally recognized as leaders in big data analytics. Their work includes developing platforms and technology to acquire, analyze, store, share, and display huge volumes of genomic data. The institute has become a research powerhouse, with external funding from grants and contracts currently around $25 million per year. This was the projected goal for growth in 3 years, but the Genomics Institute has already reached this level of grants and is now aiming even higher.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Genomics Institute at 2300 Delaware Ave. represents a major step toward the campus&#8217;s long-term vision for the complex as a premier research center supporting the campus&#8217;s growing research programs and creating greater opportunities for collaboration and innovation.</p>
<p>A former Texas Instruments facility acquired by the university in 2004, the complex has needed extensive renovations, and work on the site is still ongoing. Over the past few years, however, a growing number of research labs have moved in, including several major laboratories in<span> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/06/materials-science.html">materials science and engineering</a></span>. Labs for robotics and smart power research are being readied for occupation in the near future, and the Genomics Institute also has plans to develop new laboratory facilities at the site.</p>
<p>&#8220;The formal establishment of the Genomics Institute as an ORU, and its relocation to the Delaware research complex, demonstrates the campus&#8217;s commitment not only to genomics research, but also to the community of Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;A prominent research center on the west side of Santa Cruz will foster beneficial collaborations with the growing Santa Cruz tech industry. We&#8217;re very pleased with Baskin Engineering&#8217;s pivotal role in this thriving Santa Cruz research and innovation hub.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Revealing life's code</strong></p>
<p>Based in the<span> <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a></span>, the Genomics Institute brings together staff and faculty in engineering, physical and biological sciences, and social sciences. With a research mission focused on &#8220;revealing life&#8217;s code&#8203;,&#8221; the institute&#8217;s researchers are using genomics to identify the underpinnings of disease, to unravel evolutionary patterns that guide life, and to unite global communities through genomic data sharing.</p>
<p>David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and founding director of the Genomics Institute, said these are exciting times not only for the institute but for the entire field of genomics.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are involved in a new era of genomics that will have a real impact on clinical medicine and patients&#8217; lives,&#8221; Haussler said. &#8220;Beyond clinical medicine and genome sequencing, our researchers are applying genomics in areas such as the conservation of biodiversity, evolutionary biology, and forensics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Genomics Institute is organized around four major themes: health, nature, technology, and society. Haussler noted that advances in the first three areas cannot be made without tackling the fundamental societal and policy questions raised by the growth of genomic technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are huge social issues afoot, with concerns about the privacy of genomic data, ethical concerns about the power of CRISPR technology to edit the genome, and other sensitive issues that need to be addressed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Faculty affiliated with the Genomics Institute include social scientists such as Jenny Reardon, a professor of sociology and director of the<span> <a href="https://scijust.ucsc.edu/">Science and Justice Research Center</a></span> at UCSC. The institute is also developing partnerships with researchers in the humanities and the arts, including plans for an exhibition of genomics-related art at 2300 Delaware Ave. A new artist-in-residence program at the institute is being led by art professor Jennifer Parker.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Cross-disciplinary interactions</strong></p>
<p>While cross-disciplinary interactions have always been central to the genomics research at UC Santa Cruz, the ORU provides a stronger platform for supporting those interactions, as does the new centralized location, said Benedict Paten, associate director of the Genomics Institute and a professor of biomolecular engineering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, we were able to accomplish a lot distributed across several buildings on campus, but now, having a central place combined with an official basis as an institute will make us much more cohesive,&#8221; Paten said. &#8220;It is so important to have people together in one space, talking to each other and having those serendipitous conversations that lead to new ideas. I think it will have a profound effect on our work as a research institute.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Genomics Institute&#8217;s investigators have been at the forefront of cancer genomics, founding the<span> <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/treehouse-childhood-cancer-initiative/">Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative</a></span> to help children with difficult to treat cancers, cofounding the<span> <a href="https://brcaexchange.org/">BRCA Exchange</a></span> to build a comprehensive repository of breast cancer data, and playing a leadership role in the<span> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/04/pan-cancer-atlas.html">Pan Cancer Initiative</a></span> of The Cancer Genome Atlas program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>
<p>The<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/"><span> UCSC Genome Browse</span>r</a>, which receives over a million hits a day, is used by biomedical researchers worldwide. In 2017, Genomics Institute investigators joined with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and the University of Chicago to form the<span> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/11/nih-data-commons.html">Commons Alliance</a></span>, funded by NIH to create a cohesive cloud-based data storage and computation platform for analyzing biomedical data.</p>
<p>UCSC also has leading experts in several other areas of genomics, including<span> <a href="https://pgl.soe.ucsc.edu/">paleogenomics</a></span> (the study of ancient DNA, including that of extinct animals and humans) and<span> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/nanopore-genome.html">nanopore sequencing</a></span>, a novel and powerful DNA sequencing technology that analyzes DNA and other molecules as they pass through a tiny pore called a nanopore.</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s genomics researchers have been among the most prolific innovators and entrepreneurs on campus, spinning off several local start-up companies. Ed Green, professor of biomolecular engineering, has started two companies:<span> <a href="https://dovetailgenomics.com/">Dovetail Genomics</a></span> and<span> <a href="https://www.claretbio.com/">Claret Bioscience</a></span>. Other spin-offs from UCSC genomics research include<span> <a href="https://nantomics.com/">NantOmics</a></span> (formerly Five3 Genomics) and<span> <a href="https://www.ontera.bio/">Ontera</a></span> (formerly Two Pore Guys).</p>
<p>Haussler has been a leading advocate of international data sharing, cofounding the<span> <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health</a></span>, which brings together over 500 leading institutions to develop a common framework for secure sharing of genomic and clinical data. Genomics researchers at UC Santa Cruz have always had a commitment to openness, starting with making the first human genome sequence publicly available on the web. Haussler said the institute, as a public institution dedicated to creating a healthier world and a healthier society, will continue to openly share all that its researchers learn and create.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have always collaborated to produce and publicly distribute the products of our unique expertise in genome data processing, genome interpretation, ecological modeling, and the contributions of DNA variants to disease that have been so transformative,&#8221; he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f4d327dc8072701734bebd3cab079bad"><name>summer-session</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Summer enrollment numbers continue to grow</title><summary>Summer enrollment grew for the third year in a row at UC Santa Cruz Summer Session with more than 5,999 students taking summer classes.

Yet little is known about their prevalence, distribution, or how they might respond to climate change and other ecological disturbances.</p>
<p>Kai Zhu, an assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is determined to shed light on these subterranean scavengers, and a new $700,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) is giving his efforts a boost.</p>
<p>Soil fungi serve a host of functions in the plant community. They act as both decomposers and scavengers, breaking down complex organic materials and gathering scarce nutrients that plants need. There are both pathogenic and beneficial soil fungi, and their interactions with plants help promote biodiversity.</p>
<p>But far less is known about the numbers and types of fungal species in different ecosystems, and how those fungal communities might change over time. Zhu, an ecologist whose background is in physics and statistics, will use the three-year NSF grant to build state-of-the-art models of soil fungal diversity across the North American continent.</p>
<p>"This is really uncharted territory," said Zhu. "The climate is changing, and fungi will change, too. Those changes will impact tree distribution, and changes in fungi may also impact the soil itself."</p>
<p>Understanding those processes is critical, because the amount of carbon in soil exceeds the carbon in all plants and the atmosphere combined, noted Zhu.</p>
<p>"A lot of the carbon discussion focuses on carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but even a small change in soil carbon could override the atmosphere," he said. "It's a big deal. Compared to what we know about trees, we know little about the geographic distribution of soil fungi."</p>
<p>"This research underscores the pressing need to investigate the impacts of climate change on interconnected communities," said Greg Gilbert, professor and chair of Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz. "Kai Zhu is uniquely poised to lead this effort."</p>
<p>Zhu will collaborate with Stanford University biologist and co-principal investigator Kabir Peay to map the presence and abundance of soil fungi. Their team will integrate DNA sequencing data from soil fungi gathered in two projects: the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and the Dimensions of Biodiversity project on North American soil fungi (DoB-FUN).</p>
<p>The datasets are "pretty compatible," said Zhu, explaining that the NEON data was gathered from soil samples in varied forests, while the DoB-FUN data was pulled only from soil near pine trees; both datasets represent species abundances and the major environmental conditions within each domain. All told, the data represent 110 sites, mostly in the United States but including a few sites in Canada, too.</p>
<p>In contrast to previous studies, which typically focus on the details of only one species of fungus in one location, this project will be "hyperdiverse," encompassing many species from many locations, as well as their interactions. Zhu's models will enable researchers to study soil fungal biodiversity across the continent, considering how soil fungi change with the environment, as well as how those changes are impacted by neighboring plant communities.</p>
<p>"Soil fungi are everywhere, and the assumption was that they are dispersed equally, but that's not true," said Zhu. "New molecular techniques have allowed us to identify species and to focus on local distribution. This will be one of the first large-scale studies on the geographic distribution of soil fungi."</p>
<p>Looking at all the species together will allow researchers to consider joint effects on the ecosystem and help them understand geographic responses of soil fungi to climate and environmental changes, he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="febde0298072701734bebd3c651140e6"><name>casfs-panetta</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Farm hosts organic ag research tour for Congressman Jimmy Panetta </title><summary>It was a beautiful September morning when Congressman Jimmy Panetta visited the UCSC Farm to hear from leading researchers in the field of organic agriculture.&#13;

<p>Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) got updates from faculty member <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/08/shennan-usda.html">Carol Shennan</a>, a professor of environmental studies, and <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/05/muramoto-specialist.html">UC Cooperative Extension Specialist Joji Muramoto</a>, who have led the campus's pioneering work on organic strawberry production. He also learned about "no-till" farming, a strategy designed to increase carbon sequestered in the soil, from Farm Manager Darryl Wong, who is also a graduate student in environmental studies.</p>
<p>Panetta, who was delighted to receive a bag of strawberries from grower Rod&#160;Koda of Shinta Kawahara Farm, listened carefully and fielded questions from a number of attendees. The "field day" was a joint production of UCSC's Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) and the Santa Cruz-based Organic Farming Research Foundation (OFRF). The two organizations share a vision of producing food in harmony with natural systems.</p>
<p>CASFS Executive Director Daniel Press underscored the research contributions of public universities, and UCSC in particular, throughout Panetta's visit. Brise Tencer, executive director of OFRF, made the link between university research and public policy. Stacy Philpott, professor of environmental studies, highlighted educational programs and student experiences that can be transformational for undergraduates.</p>
<p>"Thanks to Jimmy Panetta, and Sam Farr before him, UC Santa Cruz has been the beneficiary of federal investment in organic agricultural research for many years&#8212;an investment that has paid handsome returns for farmers and consumers," said Press. "We were delighted to show Congressman Panetta where those dollars have gone and to highlight our leadership in sustainable agriculture."</p>
<p>Press also described the pathbreaking work in <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/research/agroecological-science/aquaculture.html">sustainable aquaculture</a> being done by Anne Kapuscinski, a professor of environmental studies and the director of UCSC's new <a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/">Coastal Science and Policy Program</a>. Kapuscinski has developed an ocean-friendly feed for farmed fish based on microalgae rather than wild fish. Her lab, which is under construction, will be based on the UCSC Farm.</p>
<p>Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell attended the tour and said afterwards that bringing elected officials to campus is an impactful way to communicate the importance of investing in the university. "It really brings the message home when they can see firsthand what we're able to do with their support," she said. "Their work helps make all of this possible."</p>
<p>The visit was organized by OFRF with help from their policy intern Chantal Waite, a UCSC undergraduate who also works in Shennan's lab.</p>
<p>During a free-ranging, post-tour discussion, CASFS research associate Mark Lipson (Merrill, '81, environmental studies) and Tencer expressed concern about structural changes taking place at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, including moving offices from Washington, D.C. to Kansas City.</p>
<p>"We have to do what we didn't do in November 2016, which is get out the vote and vote," Panetta said with a smile.</p>

<p>The prize recognizes Primack &#8220;for seminal contributions to our understanding of the formation of structure in the universe, and for communicating to the public the extraordinary progress in our understanding of cosmology.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the APS&#8217;s most prestigious honors, the Lilienfeld Prize recognizes outstanding contributions to physics by a single individual who also has exceptional skills in lecturing to diverse audiences. It includes an award of $10,000, a certificate, and travel expenses to give three lectures at various institutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joel Primack is an inspired choice for this year&#8217;s Lilienfeld Prize,&#8221; said APS President-Elect Philip H. Bucksbaum, chair of the 2020 prize selection committee. &#8220;Joel has contributed greatly to our current understanding of the fundamental makeup of the universe and has helped to establish the paradigm of cold dark matter cosmology. Equally important is his work as an effective voice for science in the public and in public policy, not only through lectures and books to general audiences, but also through active participation in policy initiatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Primack is one of the main inventors and developers of the modern theory of the universe (cold dark matter with a cosmological constant), which among other things explains why galaxies exist, how they form, and how they are distributed in space. For example, although our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and many other nearby galaxies are disk-shaped, by comparing Hubble Space Telescope images with their supercomputer simulations, Primack and his colleagues recently discovered that most galaxies start out pickle-shaped because of the filamentary distribution of dark matter in the early universe.</p>
<p>A fellow of the APS, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and California Academy of Sciences, Primack joined the UCSC faculty in 1973. He continues to be very active in research, supervising four graduate students and several senior thesis students, and helping lead several international collaborations and scientific organizations. He has hosted the annual Santa Cruz Galaxy Workshop for many years, and he organized and directed the UC High-Performance AstroComputing Center from 2010 to 2015.</p>
<p>Primack's many awards and honors include the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/news-article.html">2016 APS Leo Szilard Lectureship Award</a> for helping establish the Congressional Science and Technology Policy Fellowships. He also started the AAAS Science and Human Rights program and chaired the AAAS Committee on Science, Ethics, and Religion. He was the 2018-19 president of the scientific research honor society Sigma Xi.</p>
<p>In addition to his many publications in scientific journals, Primack coauthored a book on science and public policy with Frank von Hippel,<em> Advice and Dissent: Scientists in the Political Arena</em> (1974), as well as two popular books on modern cosmology and its implications for how we think about global problems, both coauthored with his wife Nancy Abrams: <em>The View from the Center of the Universe: Discovering Our Extraordinary Place in the Cosmos</em> (2006) and <em>The New Universe and the Human Future: How a Shared Cosmology Could Transform the World</em> (2011). He has also written many popular articles and given many lectures for the general public.</p>
<p>The Lilienfeld Prize will be presented to Primack on January 30, 2020, during the APS Annual Leadership Meeting in Washington, D.C.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0236c0b58072701734bebd3cd2f748b6"><name>cronin-switzer-fellowship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Switzer Environmental Fellowship awarded to UCSC graduate student</title><summary>Melissa Cronin, a Ph.D. candidate in ecology and evolutionary biology, has been awarded a Switzer Environmental Fellowship from the Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation.</summary><keywords>Melissa Cronin</keywords><start-date>1567666800000</start-date><display-name>Switzer Environmental Fellowship awarded to UCSC graduate student</display-name><path>/2019/09/cronin-switzer-fellowship</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/cronin-switzer-fellowship</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1567700204957</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1567700419963</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/melissa-cronin-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/melissa-cronin-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>melissa-cronin-350.jpg</name><display-name>melissa-cronin-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>81502</file-size><width>350</width><height>398</height></image><image-alt>Melissa Cronin</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/melissa-cronin-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/melissa-cronin-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>melissa-cronin-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>melissa-cronin-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19198</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Melissa Cronin</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Melissa Cronin (photo by C.

The prestigious fellowship recognizes promising environmental leaders and provides $15,000 to support their research.</p>
<p>Cronin's research focuses on threatened manta ray and devil ray populations, which are often caught as bycatch in industrial fishing operations. She works in the <a href="https://ccal.ucsc.edu/">Conservation Action Lab</a> at UC Santa Cruz led by EEB professor Donald Croll and adjunct professor Bernie Tershy.</p>
<p>Funding from the Switzer Fellowship will help with the cost of genetic analyses Cronin is conducting to help understand and characterize manta and devil ray populations. She will also use the fellowship to further her professional development as a conservation biologist by attending domestic and international conferences to present her work and learn from others working to develop novel conservation solutions.</p>
<p>"Already, this grant has allowed me to attend the Conservation Optimism Summit in Oxford, U.K., where I led a workshop on effective conservation storytelling and how we can create positive narratives to galvanize support for threatened species," Cronin said. "I am extremely grateful to the Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation for this career-changing support, as well as for the opportunity to join such an incredible network of environmental leaders."</p>
<p>The Switzer Foundation has invested nearly $16 million in these fellowships and related grant programs over the past 33 years. In addition to the fellowship funding, Switzer Fellows have access to critical leadership skills trainings and networking during their fellowship year and beyond, including membership in the Switzer Fellows&#8217; Network comprised of more than 650 Switzer Fellows based throughout the U.S. and internationally.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="023d62ff8072701734bebd3cfaeb3efd"><name>paytan-huntsman-medal</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Marine scientist Adina Paytan to receive A.G.

Huntsman Award for Excellence in the Marine Sciences presented by the Royal Society of Canada. Paytan will receive the Huntsman Medal and give a public lecture in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on November 7.</p>
<p>The 2019 A.G. Huntsman Medal will be awarded to Paytan "in recognition of her discoveries in the paleoceanographic history of important elements used to recreate the geochemical history of the planet, and of outstanding contributions to understanding the biogeochemical links between global earth-ocean-atmosphere nutrient controls on carbon productivity and paleoclimate."</p>
<p>Paytan studies chemical and biological processes in the oceans, how they have changed over time, and how they are affected by human activities. An overarching goal of her research is to understand the processes and feedbacks operating in the Earth System and how they relate to global changes in climate and tectonics. In addition, she is interested in natural and anthropogenically induced perturbations that affect biogeochemical processes and their impact on humans and the environment.</p>
<p>A fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), Association of Limnologists and Oceanographers (ASLO), and the Geochemical Society (GSA), Paytan is internationally recognized for her leadership and scientific accomplishments. Her awards and honors include the Dansgaard Award for Mid-Career Scientists, the AGU Rachel Carson Lecture, and the Petersen Foundation Excellence in Research Award. She has mentored many students and has coordinated a wide range of education and outreach initiatives.</p>
<p>Paytan received her Ph.D. in oceanography at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. She came to UC Santa Cruz in 2007 as a research scientist in the IMS.</p>
<p>The Huntsman Award was established in 1980 by the Canadian marine science community to recognize excellence of research and outstanding contributions to marine sciences. It honors marine scientists of any nationality who have had and continue to have a significant influence on the course of marine scientific thought. The award is named in honor of Archibald Gowanlock Huntsman (1883&#8211;1973), a pioneer Canadian oceanographer and fishery biologist.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="02451a828072701734bebd3ce1979f55"><name>lam-k99-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Postdoc Hanh Lam awarded prestigious NIH grant</title><summary>Hanh Lam, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology, has received the NIH Pathway to Independence Career Development Award.</summary><start-date>1567666800000</start-date><display-name>Postdoc Hanh Lam awarded prestigious NIH grant</display-name><path>/2019/09/lam-k99-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/lam-k99-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1567701145455</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1567701393719</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Environmental Toxicology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/hanh-lam-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/hanh-lam-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hanh-lam-350.jpg</name><display-name>hanh-lam-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>82962</file-size><width>350</width><height>381</height></image><image-alt>Hanh Lam</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/hanh-lam-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/hanh-lam-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hanh-lam-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>hanh-lam-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19359</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Hanh Lam</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Hanh Lam</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Hanh Lam, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology (METX), has received a major grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) known as the Pathway to Independence Career Development Award, or NIH K99/R00 grant.</p>
<p>The grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases will support Lam's ongoing research to develop novel therapeutics to combat infections caused by <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, a bacterial pathogen that is often resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Lam's work in the lab of METX Professor Victoria Auerbuch Stone uses a combination of experimental and bioinformatic approaches to target this top priority pathogen.</p>
<p>Antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause over $20 billion in direct health care costs every year in the United States, with additional lost productivity valued at $35 billion. More than 2 million illnesses from antibiotic-resistant infections occur every year in the U.S., resulting in at least 23,000 deaths, and 8% of all healthcare-associated infections are caused by <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. As many as 13% of all <em>Pseudomonas</em> strains are resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics, and several classes of antibiotics are no longer curative for this important pathogen.</p>
<p>Traditional antibiotics work by targeting bacterial structures found in both harmless bacteria and pathogens, resulting in collateral damage to the healthy microorganism community in our bodies and increasing the frequency of antibiotic resistance. One way to address the current crisis of rising antibiotic resistance is to develop novel, targeted strategies to fight pathogenic bacteria. Together with a large team of collaborators, Lam aims to identify and develop chemical compounds that target an important virulence-associated structure, called the type III secretion system, used only by pathogens such as <em>Pseudomonas</em>.</p>
<p>The K99 phase of the award will support Lam's research in the Auerbuch Stone lab at UC Santa Cruz, while the R00 phase will support her once she transitions to a tenure-track assistant professor position.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="02a2e7ec8072701734bebd3c3bfdfaab"><name>callanan-language</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Talking about scientific results without overstating the findings</title><summary>Developmental psychologist Maureen Callanan has coauthored a new paper about researchers' use of "generic language" when they report scientific findings, a tendency that leads to bolder claims that may sacrifice precision. </summary><keywords>psychology, language</keywords><start-date>1567666800000</start-date><display-name>Callanan-Language</display-name><path>/2019/09/callanan-language</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/callanan-language</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1567707292915</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1567707292915</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/callanan_400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/callanan_400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>callanan_400.jpg</name><display-name>callanan_400.jpg</display-name><file-size>46541</file-size><width>400</width><height>285</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Maureen Callanan</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/callanan_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/callanan_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>callanan_80.jpg</name><display-name>callanan_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>7836</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Maureen Callanan</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>"The challenge is figuring out how to report findings in a way that's honest and also gets the work noticed," said Maureen Callanan, who speculated that the use of so-called "generic language" may also occur in fields other than psychology.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Sometimes the most productive conversations at scientific conferences happen outside the formal sessions. That was the case for Psychology Professor Maureen Callanan, who attended a meeting a few years ago during which she participated on a panel about research on diversity in developmental psychology.</p>
<p>Afterwards, she and her colleague Susan Gelman, a professor of psychology and linguistics at the University of Michigan, discussed researchers' tendency to take a simple finding and state it as a universal truth, generalizing beyond the scope of an individual study.</p>
<p>"It's the difference between saying, 'What the 5-year-olds <em>in this study did</em>&#8230;' and 'What 5-year-olds do,' " explained Callanan, a developmental psychologist. "To imply that <em>all </em>children behave a certain way ignores that most research in developmental psychology is based on studies of white, middle-class children."</p>
<p>This use of "generic language" gives the impression there's no nuance, and it can be misleading, Callanan and Gelman agreed. And they started to wonder how prevalent it is in the literature.</p>
<p>Fast forward to August 26, when Callanan and Gelman published an article they coauthored with Jasmine DeJesus and Graciela Solis in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, "<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/08/23/1817706116#sec-12">Generic Language in Scientific Communication</a>." Their analysis of nearly 1,150 psychology journal articles published in 2015-16 revealed that generic language was used in 89 percent of the research summaries. The use of such "universal" language is particularly troublesome given that 73 percent of those articles made no mention of the race or ethnicity of their participants, one of several demographic factors that could limit the relevance of findings about one group to another; similarly, 79% of articles did not mention the income level of the sample, and 74% didn't note language background.</p>
<p>"Using generic language is especially problematic if researchers are overgeneralizing from selective or limited samples," said Callanan. The authors noted that the field of psychology even has an acronym that acknowledges the homogeneous nature of typical samples: WEIRD, which stands for participants from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic societies.</p>
<p>The authors identify several forces contributing to the use of generalizations, including a desire to make the work accessible to broad audiences&#8212;and appealing to funding agencies. However, glossing over findings and failing to describe study samples could lead to exaggerated conclusions, they caution.</p>
<p>"Because scientists are encouraged to reach broad conclusions, their writing may sacrifice precision in favor of bolder claims,&#8221; said DeJesus, assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and the article&#8217;s first author.</p>
<p>A follow-up study indicated research summaries that used generic language pack more punch than more nuanced summaries, at least among the undergraduates and others survey participants, who consistently rated them "more important."</p>
<p>"The challenge is figuring out how to report findings in a way that's honest and also gets the work noticed," said Callanan, who speculated that this phenomenon may also occur in fields other than psychology. "I'd like to see researchers do a better job of being accessible and concise, while also fully acknowledging variability and the limits of our evidence."</p>
<p>At a minimum, Callanan urged researchers to refrain from making sweeping generalizations and to consider referring to their participants&#8217; behavior in the past tense to emphasize that the findings are limited to the study and not necessarily applicable to other groups or a predictor of future behavior.</p>
<p>"A single study really isn't enough basis for a broad generalization," she said. "That type of language might be more appropriate when reviewing a whole literature and summarizing across multiple studies."</p>
<p>Even with a representative sample, it may not be appropriate to generalize, noted Callanan, who has wrestled with these issues in her own work. "I'm less focused on findings that can be generalized, because there is always nuance," she said. "There are always differences, even among white, middle-class kids."</p>
<p>Callanan also sees broader negative consequences of using generic language to talk about scientific findings that are based on samples from very specific groups&#8212;often middle-class, white families. "It makes people think that's the norm, and if findings among another group are different, it is considered a deficit," she said. "That's the danger."</p>
<p>Rather, it's important to study individual communities on their own terms, not as outliers or exceptions to the norm, she said. Avoiding generic language is part of a broader effort to be inclusive, an effort that has shaped Callanan's work over three decades. Her own research focuses on how children learn about science and the world around them, and she appreciates the tremendous range and variety she has observed.</p>
<p>"People have different ways of learning about the natural world," she said. "I'm not looking anymore for the one way children learn. I think that puts us on a false path. We should be looking not just for generalizable findings but also for variation, because there is going to be both in whatever topic we're studying."</p>

<p>How can a spy spend years hidden at the highest levels of the Pentagon?</p>
<p>Why is it so hard to detect a lie or judge a stranger's motives?</p>
<p>Why do we so often get other people wrong?&#160;</p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s latest book, <em>Talking to Strangers</em>: <em>What We Should Know about the People We Don't Know,</em> is an exploration of how we make sense of the familiar. His focus is on the &#8220;default to truth&#8221; theory--how our basic reaction to receiving any new information is to believe it--and the tragic results that often occur when we come into contact with people whose assumptions, perspectives, and backgrounds are different from our own.</p>
<p>The author of five <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers--<em>The Tipping Point, Blink, Outliers, What the Dog Saw,</em> and <em>David and Goliath, </em>Gladwell has been included in <em>TIME</em> magazine&#8217;s list of 100 Most Influential People and named one of <em>Foreign Policy</em>'s Top Global Thinkers. He has been a staff writer at the <em>New Yorker</em> since 1996 and previously was a journalist at the <em>Washington Post</em>.</p>
<p>Gladwell&#8217;s new book, his first in six years, will be published on September 10. And on September 21, The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz and Bookshop Santa Cruz, will present &#8220;An Evening with Malcolm Gladwell&#8221; to discuss <em>Talking to Strangers</em>&#160;at the San Mateo Performing Arts Center.</p>
<p>As Gladwell puts it: &#8220;Something is very wrong with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don&#8217;t know. And because we don&#8217;t know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The subjects in <em>Talking to Strangers</em> are often drawn straight from the news. They include a look at the gullibility of investors who lost fortunes to the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the Italian government&#8217;s case against Amanda Knox, the Jerry Sandusky pedophilia scandal at Penn State University, and the death of Sandra Bland, a young black woman who killed herself in police custody after she was arrested following a dispute with a Texas police officer.</p>
<p>He also uses research to re-examine Nevillle Chamberlain&#8217;s trust of Adolph Hitler, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, challenging traditional wisdom about their behavior and its motivations.</p>
<p>Last year, Gladwell co-founded Pushkin Industries, an audio content company that features his signature podcast, <em>Revisionist History</em>--"which reconsiders things both overlooked and misunderstood.&#8221; The podcast has recently drawn as many as 3 million listeners per episode.</p>
<p>He is additionally the co-founder of the <em>Broken Record</em> podcast, where along with Rick Rubin and Bruce Headlam, he interviews musicians from a wide variety of genres.</p>
<p>But Gladwell is best known for his uncanny ability to make complex ideas and research accessible to a mass audience through stories that clearly illustrate their value. As he recently told <em>The Guardian</em>, &#8220;I&#8217;m just trying to get people to take human psychology seriously and to respect the complexity of human behavior and motivations.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first-ever social mobility list measures how well universities graduated students who received federal Pell Grants, which are typically awarded to students who come from households that earn less than $50,000 annually.&#160;</p>
<p>"There is profound value in earning a college degree with lifelong impacts," Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;UC Santa Cruz is proud to be recognized for our efforts to provide access to a high quality educational experience and especially for the impact this experience provides to low income and first-generation students over their lifetime.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is committed to providing access to a high quality education that transforms the lives of students from all backgrounds, as well as supporting students through their college journey.&#160;</p>
<p>The University of California is an <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/climb-mobility-analysis">equalizer for students</a> from low-income families. They go on to earn as much as students who came from middle-income families, and their earnings double by a decade after graduation.</p>
<p>Instruction begins in just under three weeks, and UC Santa Cruz will educate more than 5,700 students from low-income backgrounds.</p>
<p>The ethnic diversity of UC Santa Cruz was also highlighted in the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-santa-cruz-1321">U.S. News and World Report rankings</a>. US News and World Report&#8217;s diversity index for UC Santa Cruz was .72&#8212;with values closer to 1.0 meaning a student is more likely to run into students from a different ethnic group. Only ten universities across the United States had a higher index than UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</p>
<p>In fall 2018, 28 percent of the undergraduate class was Asian, 26 percent was Hispanic/Latino, 4 percent was African American, and .8 percent was American Indian. The campus continues its outreach efforts to students across the state to ensure they know that a UC Santa Cruz education is accessible and affordable.&#160;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz ranked among the top public schools (No. 34) and the top national universities (No. 84). The US News and World Report looks at a variety of factors in its rankings, including retention and graduation rates, social mobility, faculty resources, and more.&#160;</p>

<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz has done an amazing job of aligning its foundational sustainability values with tangible actions, and this achievement speaks strongly to that,&#8221; Sustainability Director Elida Erickson said.&#160;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz moved up to the 21st spot on the ranking from the 23rd spot in 2017. Other UCs on the list include Berkeley (No. 16), Merced (No. 6), and Irvine (No. 2).</p>
<p>Sierra magazine has been ranking universities for 13 years, and a record 282 schools participated this year. Sierra noted that its ranking focuses on what universities offer "the best sustainability-focused courses, ecofriendly cafeteria provisions, and carbon-neutral land and energy policies, as well as the most opportunities to engage with the environmental movement."</p>
<p>Over the next year, UC Santa Cruz will continue to make sustainable strides. Its first major solar photovoltaic array, at the East Remote Parking lot, will come online. The 2.1 megawatt array will provide about 21 percent of the main campus&#8217; electrical needs.&#160;</p>
<p>The campus is also taking significant challenges head-on, including recycling contamination on campus in the midst of major changes in the global recycling market.</p>
<p>&#8220;UCSC has many exciting opportunities to continue to improve our sustainability performance over the years ahead, and will continue to directly engage students in this important work,&#8221; Erickson said.&#160;</p>
<p>Sierra's ranking is based on the information universities provide to the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) for its Sustainability Tracking and Rating System (STARS).&#160;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz once again <a href="https://reports.aashe.org/institutions/university-of-california-santa-cruz-ca/report/2019-03-01/">achieved gold status</a>, the second-highest honor. Platinum is the top level, which was achieved by only five universities.</p>
<p>AASHE assesses universities in 17 areas, ranging from curriculum to purchasing.</p>
<p>For STARS, UC Santa Cruz was highlighted as a top performer in the Investment and Finance category. The campus was the highest ranked University of California campus in this lineup, tying with UC Merced for the fifth spot. UC Berkeley was ranked No. 8 and UC Irvine, UC San Diego, and UC Santa Barbara tied for ninth place.&#160;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz tied for sixth place in a ranking that reviewed universities conducting research focused on sustainability.</p>
<p>The pioneering work of the People of Color Sustainability Collective was highlighted in the STARS report (<a href="https://www.aashe.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SCI-2019.pdf">PDF link</a>).</p>
<p>"The People of Color Sustainability Collective (PoCSC) at the University of California Santa Cruz aims to make UCSC a leader in environmental justice, in recognition of our changing demographics and pressing ecological challenges," the report notes. "PoCSC is accomplishing this by raising awareness about the contributions that people of color have made to the environmental sustainability movement; reexamining the definition and values of the sustainability movement to identify how it can be more inclusive of all underrepresented populations; and creating dialogue about environmental justice through student discussion spaces, social media awareness campaigns, workshops, and speaker presentations."</p>
<p>The report is public, and can be <a href="https://reports.aashe.org/institutions/university-of-california-santa-cruz-ca/report/2019-03-01/">viewed online</a>. The Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System (STARS) is designed by AASHE to be a transparent, self-reporting framework for colleges and universities to measure their sustainability performance.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="26fa227d807270173ecef56bde56164e"><name>the-rankings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz ranks as a top worldwide research university</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is among the top 200 research universities in the world, according to the latest analysis published by Times Higher Education (THE).</summary><start-date>1568185200000</start-date><display-name>Times Higher Education rankings</display-name><path>/2019/09/the-rankings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/the-rankings</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1568316990041</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1568316990041</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/research-group-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/research-group-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>research-group-500px.jpg</name><display-name>research-group-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>67010</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Research group</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/research-group-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/research-group-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>research-group-80px.jpg</name><display-name>research-group-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>10388</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Research group</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2020/world-ranking#!/page/1/length/25/sort_by/scores_citations/sort_order/asc/cols/scores">ranked highest</a> (No. 37) for&#160;research influence, as measured by the number of times its faculty&#8217;s published work is cited by scholars around the world.for research citations.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz is among the top 200 research universities in the world, according to the <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2020/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats">latest analysis published</a> by Times Higher Education (THE).</p>

<p>Roberto Manduchi, professor of computer science and engineering at UC Santa Cruz, will moderate a panel at the conference, which focuses on assistive technology for people who are blind or visually impaired. Manduchi's <a href="https://vision.soe.ucsc.edu/">Computer Vision Lab</a> at the Baskin School of Engineering has been working in this area for many years, and he has worked closely with the Vista Center in his research.</p>
<p>Manduchi noted that many of the top technology companies will be represented at this year's Vista TEC conference, including Google, Netflix, Amazon, and Microsoft.</p>
<p>"This is a timely event, because a lot of big companies have begun to create innovative products and apps for people with disabilities," he said.</p>
<p>The conference provides a platform for assistive technology users, tech researchers, and software developers, along with friends and family of the blind and visually impaired community, to collaborate, exchange ideas, and discuss best practices in the field of technology accessibility.</p>
<p>Manduchi's panel will discuss the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to drive new developments in assistive technology. "Advances in AI and machine learning have led to a lot of interest in using AI to help people with disabilities," he said.</p>
<p>Other panels at the conference will address issues related to autonomous vehicles, inclusive workplaces, and other topics.

<p>The long-term study, <a href="https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjz-2019-0104">published September 17 in the <em>Canadian Journal of Zoology</em></a>, documented the lifetime reproductive success of 7,735 female northern elephant seals at the A&#241;o Nuevo rookery north of Santa Cruz. Only 6 percent of the females gave birth to 10 or more pups during their lifetimes, and those "supermoms" accounted for more than half (55%) of the total pup production.</p>
<p>"It's surprising because there are so many more young females than older females, and you expect them to contribute more to the population. But it doesn't work out that way, because most of them don't live very long," said Burney Le Boeuf, professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and lead author of the paper.</p>
<p>In fact, the researchers found that three-quarters of the weaned female pups die before reaching maturity and never breed at all. Of the ones that survive to maturity, most only breed one to three times before they die. Breeding takes a toll on the young females, who must invest a lot of energy in their pup at a time when they themselves are still growing, Le Boeuf said.</p>
<p>"The supermoms are able to pull it off," he said. "There aren't many of them, but they have a tremendous influence on the next generation."</p>
<p>The longest-lived female in the study lived to age 23 and produced 17 pups in her lifetime. Another supermom produced pups in 16 consecutive years.</p>
<p>Female elephant seals give birth annually to a single pup in winter. They spend four weeks on the beach nursing their pup, relying entirely on stored reserves, before weaning the pup and heading out to sea to feed. Once a female elephant seal begins breeding at the age of three or four, she is typically either pregnant or nursing for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>During their first trips to sea, the weaned pups are naive and may struggle to find enough food or fall prey to sharks or orcas. Because deaths almost always occur at sea, it is hard to say which are the most important causes of the high mortality rate for young elephant seals.</p>
<p>The surviving females get larger as they age, and bigger moms give birth to bigger pups, which are more likely to survive to maturity and breed. The key to the high productivity of the elephant seal supermoms is simply that they live longer than other females and breed as often as possible, Le Boeuf said.</p>
<p>Lifetime reproductive success is an important measure of evolutionary fitness, a central concept in natural selection. Yet studies of this kind are rare in wild animals because it is so hard to track large numbers of individuals throughout their lifetimes. Researchers have tagged elephant seals at A&#241;o Nuevo every year since 1963, not long after the colony was established in 1961. The elephant seal research program at UC Santa Cruz continues to study the colony, and the electronic tagging devices now used to track the seals have grown increasingly sophisticated.</p>
<p>"It's unusual to be able to follow a wild animal throughout its life and determine how successful it is at breeding," Le Boeuf said. "With the elephant seals at A&#241;o Nuevo, we've been able to follow them for two generations, more than 50 years, in part because of the proximity of this colony just up the coast from the UCSC campus."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://anonuevoreserve.ucsc.edu/">A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve</a>, part of the UC Natural Reserve System, is an important breeding site for many species of marine mammals and birds.</p>
<p>In addition to Le Boeuf, the coauthors of the paper are Richard Condit at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago and Joanne Reiter at UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences.

<p>The Tech for Social Good program supports student-led learning and technology development for healthy, sustainable, connected, and equitable livelihoods in the United States and abroad. An <strong>information and matchmaking session for students</strong> will be held on Tuesday, October 1, from 4 to 5 p.m. in Engineering 2, Room 180.</p>
<p>"We're starting Tech for Social Good to inspire students across all campus divisions to work together creating projects that address the big challenges facing our society," said J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, director of CITRIS and the Banatao Institute at UC Santa Cruz. "It's also an excellent opportunity for them to gain experience as innovators and entrepreneurs. We're excited to support this new channel for the tremendous creativity of our campus."</p>
<p>The program is open to teams of graduate and undergraduate students and has two competitive tracks, one to support technology development and another to support student-led events on campus. Through the technology track, students can apply for funding of $500 to $5,000 for tech-focused projects that promote social good by supporting healthy, sustainable, prosperous, and equitable livelihoods in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>The events track will provide between $200 and $1,000 for individual students, student organizations, or student groups at UC Santa Cruz to develop events or programming that improve and support technological innovations that support healthy, sustainable, and connected communities.</p>
<p>CITRIS has successfully run Tech for Social Good programs on the UC Berkeley and UC Davis campuses for several years, funding and supporting a wide range of successful student-led projects and events.</p>
<p>CITRIS and the Banatao Institute create information technology solutions for society's most pressing challenges. Established in 2001, the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) leverages the interdisciplinary research strengths of multiple UC campuses to advance the University of California&#8217;s mission and the innovative spirit of California. The institute was created to shorten the pipeline between world-class laboratory research and the development of cutting-edge applications, platforms, companies, and even new industries.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2cd41fbf807270173ecef56b06e01f42"><name>citl-courses</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Designing or redesigning courses?

When the inevitable couldn&#8217;t be put off for one more day, I&#8217;d take out a piece of paper, put a date for each class meeting in the left hand margin, and agonize over which texts to read and how many days to spend on each. I&#8217;d toss in a couple of paper deadlines (not planning the actual assignments) at reasonably spaced intervals&#8212;largely dependent on the time it would take me or my TAs to grade the work and return it to students in advance of the next paper. Then I&#8217;d decide whether to give a final exam or a final paper or project. Then I&#8217;d type up the whole &#8220;syllabus,&#8221; order the books, and I&#8217;d be ready to go.&#160;</p>
<p>That was what &#8220;designing a course&#8221; meant to me for more than two decades.&#160;</p>
<p>Now, given that I had never received any training in designing courses, there&#8217;s nothing all that surprising or particularly reprehensible about this approach. I was just designing the kind of classes I had taken as an undergraduate and graduate student. I had not only never read anything on the topic of course design&#8212;I had no idea course design was something people read or write about, research, learn, and help others to learn. My course design and delivery were a reflection of what one fantastic new book on college teaching describes in its title as the <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674984417">Missing Course</a>&#8212;that is, the one you never took in graduate school on how to design and teach college courses.&#160;</p>
<p>The good news is that there are better ways to design a course than mine. The really good news is that support and advice in planning and designing your courses and syllabi is easily available to you, and it&#8217;s all accessible from your office or home. If you prefer to have your questions about teaching answered directly, you&#8217;re welcome to email the Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (citl@ucsc.edu) for an email or in-person consultation. Otherwise, there is a vast array of resources available at the touch of a few keystrokes.&#160;</p>
<p>CITL has a website of <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/teaching-resources/">teaching resources</a> prepared or selected by UC Santa Cruz instructors for UC Santa Cruz instructors. Among the many resources you&#8217;ll find there are:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://citl.indiana.edu/teaching-resources/course-design/developing-learning-outcomes/">tools</a> for identifying and articulating what you want students to learn in your course</li>
<li>step by step instructions on how to <a href="https://www.deefinkandassociates.com/GuidetoCourseDesignAug05.pdf">design or redesign a course</a> or an <a href="https://resources.depaul.edu/teaching-commons/teaching-guides/assignment-design/Pages/default.aspx">assignment</a> once you know what you want students to learn</li>
<li>sample language you can adapt for your syllabus such as <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CITL-Syllabus-Language-Academic-Integrity.pdf">academic integrity statements</a> or <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CITL-Syllabus-Language-Accessibility-and-Inclusivity.pdf">statements about inclusivity and accessibility</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/syllabus-design/">design tips</a> for making a syllabus your students will actually read and use</li>
<li>comprehensive resources on how to use <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/teaching-resources/universal-design-for-learning/">universal design for learning</a> and <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/teaching-resources/inclusive-teaching/">inclusive teaching practices</a> to create courses that have the best chance of closing equity gaps for our students</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to materials immediately relevant to course design, there are entire online <a href="http://www.pedagogyunbound.com/pedagogy-unbound-archive">archives</a> of ways to increase student engagement and foster active learning once the quarter starts, tips for encouraging lively <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/instructionalstrategies/discussions.html">discussions</a>, and advice on how to <a href="http://www.crlt.umich.edu/publinks/generalguidelines">manage difficult conversations and navigate &#8220;hot topics.&#8221;</a> If you&#8217;ve done enough reading for the day, we have recently added a library of <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/teaching-resources/mediavideos/">videos</a> of UCSC faculty giving short (5-7 minute) talks on topics ranging from how to encourage active learning in lecture courses to how to curate inclusive office hours or talk with your TAs about inclusivity.&#160;</p>
<p>Beyond what CITL has collected on its website, the higher education press is teeming at this time of year with genuinely useful advice by and for college instructors on the topic of teaching well. There&#8217;s something sweet about the desire faculty members seem to be exhibiting right now to share what they&#8217;ve learned about how to better support student learning, and it&#8217;s worth poking around to see what&#8217;s out there.&#160;</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2019-08-28-how-to-engage-students-and-support-learning-in-large-classes?cid=nwsltrtn&amp;source=ams&amp;sourceId=4631916">particularly great piece</a> I found this week included a long list of easy-to-implement techniques for promoting student engagement from longtime instructors of large lecture courses. One of the best ones there: ask students to say their name when they contribute to the discussion or ask a question in a large lecture course, and refer back to the student by name later in the class. Rather than having to learn 500 names, you just have to learn 6 or 8 per class, yet all students come away feeling that you care even a little bit about who is actually filling those seats.</p>
<p>For the first time this year, CITL is providing targeted programs for new instructors at all levels. New Teaching Assistants will take an online TA Ethics course that provides an outstanding introduction to many issues all instructors face, from power and privilege in the classroom to academic integrity and fostering inclusion and accessibility. Faculty members interested in having a closer look can contact your department graduate advisor to gain access to the course. CITL is also offering a two-day <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/programs/new-faculty-teaching-academy/">Teaching Academy for new and nearly new faculty</a>, held in the week before classes begin, that will help to introduce recently hired faculty to our students and prepare them as they make the transition to teaching at UC Santa Cruz. &#160;</p>
<p>If all of this seems overwhelming, the point is really fairly simple: whether you just arrived or you&#8217;ve been here for decades, there are resources, colleagues, and support staff available to help you get ready for teaching this Fall. When it comes to teaching, no matter what it seemed like in graduate school (or at UC Santa Cruz until pretty recently), you really don&#8217;t have to go it alone.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3b6ebd5b807270173ecef56b8ada9d18"><name>annual-campus-move-in</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Annual campus Move-In begins Thursday, September 19</title><summary>This week we are preparing to welcome more than 9,000 residential students to our community.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new sustainable and reusable UCSC branded bag will be offered to customers for a price of $0.99. To kick-off the Bookstore&#8217;s reusable shopping bag launch, 5000 bags will be distributed to new freshmen and transfer students during move-in weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz continues to strive for zero waste, despite facing challenges posed by international recycling market constrictions.&#160; Zero waste is defined by the UC system by two metrics. The first is reducing total landfill generation by 25 percent by 2025 and 50 percent by 2030. The second metric is diverting at least 90 percent of campus waste away from landfill, by recycling and composting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removing plastic bags from the Bay Tree Bookstore is a very visible step that demonstrates the campus commitment to zero waste. By encouraging folks to bring their own bags and providing reusable canvas bags instead, the Bookstore is contributing to a zero waste culture on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Environmental Center representatives and student leaders Liane Bauer, Max Perez, and Julia Applerouth were instrumental in bringing student concerns about the utilization of single-use plastics on campus to campus administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Attending a university which embodies the ideals it boasts is extremely important to students,&#8221; Bauer said. &#8220;That's why it was such a great experience to be able to work with UCSC and CHES staff to take action on the bold UCSC ideals of being a sustainable and soon to be zero waste campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This awesome accomplishment is a testament to the power of collaboration and it highlights the importance of students and staff working together. Despite many obstacles, through the agency of studen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ts and the cooperation of staff, UCSC is becoming a better, more sustainable campus every day.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3fd9ce25807270173ecef56bf1ecf92b"><name>taft-youth</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Youth activism is on the rise around the globe, and adults should pay attention, says author </title><summary>Greta and Malala get the headlines, but Jessica Taft says that for every young leader pictured on a magazine cover, thousands more are working tirelessly for causes like climate justice, racial and gender equality, LGBTQ rights, and economic change.</summary><keywords>activism, youth, peru, latin america, climate strike, climate change, climate justice, environment</keywords><start-date>1568703600000</start-date><display-name>Taft-Youth Activism</display-name><path>/2019/09/taft-youth</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/taft-youth</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1568734301697</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1568737645404</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/taft-protest_400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/taft-protest_400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>taft-protest_400.jpg</name><display-name>taft-protest_400.jpg</display-name><file-size>43252</file-size><width>400</width><height>204</height></image><image-alt>Photo of young climate justice protesters carrying signs</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/taft-protest_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/taft-protest_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>taft-protest_80.jpg</name><display-name>taft-protest_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>9876</file-size><width>80</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of young climate justice protesters carrying signs</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Youth in 150 countries will strike on Friday, Sept. 20, in a coordinated protest of inaction on climate change.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Greta and Malala get the headlines, but for every young leader pictured on a magazine cover, thousands more are working tirelessly for causes like climate justice, racial and gender equality, LGBTQ rights, and economic change.</p>
<p>That's the message from Jessica Taft, a leading scholar on youth activism who says today's young leaders are building on the legacy of their predecessors who helped desegregate the South, reformed education in Chile, and won rights for working youth in Bolivia.</p>
<p>"Around the world, we are seeing children and youth engage as social, political, and economic actors, demonstrating their capacity to help make social change," said Taft, an associate professor of Latin American and Latino Studies at UC Santa Cruz. "Adults make a lot of assumptions about children and what they're capable of, and those assumptions are often quite false."</p>
<p>Taft, the author of <em>Rebel Girls </em>and the new book <em>The Kids Are in Charge: Activism and Power in Peru's Movement of Working Children</em>, spoke days before the Sept. 20 global, youth-led climate strike. She has spent more than a decade studying children's rights and intergenerational activism.</p>
<p>"Youth, given the opportunity to work alongside adults who are willing to manage their own power, can lead activist communities and organizations," she said. "To not include them is anti-democratic. They deserve to be listened to, to be seen as collaborators and treated as equals."</p>
<p>Recent decades have seen children and youth invited to participate in civic and political activities through schools and municipal children's councils, said Taft. But participating in adult-driven institutions is distinct from what has been unfolding in Peru for 40 years. As Taft details in <em>The Kids Are in Charge</em>, Peru is home to a "horizontal," child-led movement of about 10,000 young people ages 8-16.</p>
<p>The Movement of Working Children is focused on recognizing children as social, political, and economic contributors who deserve respect, dignity, and inclusion. "The goal is to build children's leadership and participation in social movements," said Taft, clarifying that it's not only about children&#8217;s work. "This organization provides on-the-ground support for kids to develop their capacity to address issues in their communities."</p>
<p>Children and youth have organized around the need for safe play spaces, like public parks, and for recognition of children's contributions to family enterprises, such as farms, market stalls, and helping with child care and cooking, said Taft. "The reality is children do meaningful work, much of it in safe and dignified conditions, and the image of the child worker needs to be more expansive," she said.</p>
<p>Other issues include reproductive health rights, climate and environmental issues, and building a gender-inclusive curriculum for schools. The youngest participants are about 8 years old, while regional leaders typically emerge at about 12 years old; national leaders are usually about 14, said Taft.</p>
<p>"I've seen 12-year-olds facilitate meetings better than 35-year-olds," she said. "We need to decouple experience and age. Sometimes the youngest kids get listened to the most."</p>
<p>By contrast, children in the United States don't see themselves as having rights, said Taft, who attributes that in part to what she calls "social amnesia" that has wiped away the memory of the youth who led the Greensboro lunch counter sit-ins, the 1968 East L.A. walkouts, and the undocumented youth movement that led to the creation of DACA.</p>
<p>"Developmental psychologists tell us that how people develop depends on the social, cultural, and political contexts of where they're developing," she said. "The exclusion of children from political engagement isn't inevitable. It's a product of cultural assumptions about childhood and adulthood."</p>
<p>The United States remains the only eligible country that has failed to ratify the United Nations <a href="https://www.unicef.org/child-rights-convention">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>, which marks its 30th anniversary in November, noted Taft. "The Convention has given children in other countries the ability to make demands on their schools and their governments," said Taft. "Here, we talk about children as objects of protection rather than people with rights."</p>
<p>However, youth in the United States are organizing around causes they believe in, including high-profile efforts like the Sept. 20 international climate strike, the campaign for gun control being led by survivors of the Parkland high school shooting, and a campaign to lower the voting age to 16 in San Francisco. These youth leaders are pushing back on the arbitrary quality of age-based criteria for political involvement, said Taft.</p>
<p>"There is a stubborn resistance to treating young people's political activism as normal, but the truth is that it's neither extraordinary nor exceptional," she said. "Children and youth are not on the sidelines. They are protagonists in the fight for their rights and their well being."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="409c4288807270173ecef56b4207fce8"><name>peps-director</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Jolie Kerns appointed director for Physical &amp; Environmental Planning Services</title><summary>Jolie Kerns is an experienced licensed architect, LEED certified professional and skilled leader in large-scale institutional projects and campus planning. </summary><start-date>1568703600000</start-date><display-name>Campus planning </display-name><path>/2019/09/peps-director</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/peps-director</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1568747045434</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1568747045434</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am very pleased to announce Jolie Kerns as the permanent Director of Physical &amp; Environmental Planning Services.

<p>The APS citation for Williams recognizes him "for contributions to the study of gamma rays from extragalactic sources such as gamma-ray bursts and blazars, for using gamma-ray data to test cosmological models of the extragalactic background light, and for leadership in the development of past, present, and future ground-based gamma-ray telescopes."</p>
<p>Williams's research focuses on the study of high-energy gamma rays from astrophysical objects such as supermassive black holes. He is a member of two large collaborations for gamma-ray astronomy: the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) in Arizona, and the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), a planned next-generation ground-based observatory for gamma-ray astronomy at very high energies. Williams currently is deputy spokesperson of the VERITAS collaboration and chairs the CTA-US consortium. He is also an affiliated scientist with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT).</p>
<p>Williams is particularly interested in understanding the nature of gamma-ray bursts and the high-energy emission mechanism of active galactic nuclei. He participates in both the development of the instruments for the experiments, especially the electronics and photodetectors, and in the analysis and interpretation of the data.</p>
<p>The APS recognized Garaud "for fundamental contributions to the understanding of astrophysical double diffusion, especially the formation of layers and staircases."</p>
<p>Garaud's research focuses on fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics applied to astrophysics and occasionally geophysics. She specializes in understanding and quantifying mixing processes produced by large-scale fluid flows and magnetic fields, as well as small-scale turbulence. Her work involves a range of applied mathematical tools from numerical experimentation using high-performance computing to pen-and-paper analytical derivations.</p>
<p>Garaud is the founding director of the Kavli Summer Program in Astrophysics. She is also on the faculty of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Summer Program at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</p>
<p>Election as an APS Fellow is a distinct honor signifying recognition by one's professional peers. Each year, elected fellows number no more than one-half of one percent of APS membership. This year, 168 fellows were selected and recognized for their contributions to science. APS represents over 55,000 members, including physicists in academia, national laboratories, and industry in the United States and throughout the world.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4b8e82d4807270173ecef56b76836cb1"><name>kapuscinski-noaa</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sustainable aquaculture initiative lands $245,000 federal grant</title><summary>Anne Kapuscinski, professor of environmental studies and director of the Coastal Science and Policy Program, has received a $245,000 federal grant that will support her team’s work driving efforts to make aquaculture more sustainable. </summary><keywords>aquaculture, fish, NOAA, sustainability, kapuscinski</keywords><start-date>1568876400000</start-date><display-name>Kapuscinski-NOAA</display-name><path>/2019/09/kapuscinski-noaa</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/kapuscinski-noaa</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1568930693815</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1569002759383</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/kapuscinski-award.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/kapuscinski-award.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kapuscinski-award.jpg</name><display-name>kapuscinski-award.jpg</display-name><file-size>53729</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Anne Kapuscinski in her aquaculture lab</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/kapuscinski_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/kapuscinski_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kapuscinski_80.jpg</name><display-name>kapuscinski_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>4768</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Anne Kapuscinski in her aquaculture lab</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Anne Kapuscinski is&#160;leading efforts to reduce the environmental impact of farmed fish, and a new federal grant will support her efforts.

<p>As the world's appetite for fish continues to grow, Kapuscinski is leading efforts to reduce the environmental impact of farmed fish. Her team is developing an ocean-friendly, algae-based alternative food for farmed fish, who currently consume fishmeal and fish oil extracted from wild fish like anchovies and sardines, putting those populations in jeopardy.</p>
<p>The new grant from the National Sea Grant College Program, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is <a href="https://seagrant.noaa.gov/News/Article/ArtMID/1660/ArticleID/2755/Sea-Grant-awards-16-million-to-advance-US-aquaculture">one of 42 awards announced Thursday</a> (Sept. 19). Sea Grant's mission is to enhance the practical use and conservation of coastal, Great Lakes, and marine resources in order to build a sustainable economy and environment.</p>
<p>"With our 2019 investments, we are building on investments by Sea Grant and NOAA over the last few years to fill critical gaps in information and strengthen connectivity of science to industry," said Sea Grant Director Jonathan Pennock. "These investments will help advance U.S. aquaculture in sustainable, thoughtful ways using the best science and talent across the country."</p>
<p>Kapuscinski is joined on the grant by co-principal investigators Elliott Campbell, professor of environmental studies, and Pallab Sarker, associate research professor of environmental studies, as well as Brandi McKuin, a postdoctoral researcher in environmental studies. The grant will support their work developing a tool to compare the economic and environmental costs of alternative and conventional ingredients in aquaculture feeds.</p>
<p>The team is developing an open-access tool that will allow users to assess whether alternative ingredients meet the nutritional requirements of farmed fish, ensure a high-quality product with low environmental impact, and compete with the costs of conventional ingredients.</p>
<p>"We are working with stakeholders across the supply chain&#8212;aquafeed companies, fish farmers, consultants, investors, nonprofits, researchers, and government leaders&#8212;to help drive innovation, commercialization, adoption, and acceptance of more sustainable aquafeeds," said Kapuscinski.</p>
<p>Grant recipients must match 50 percent of their funding with non-federal funds. Recipients were selected from 136 proposals submitted to Sea Grant.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Warhol, Ai Weiwei, Cindy Sherman, and more than a dozen other influential internationally known contemporary artists will be on display at a new exhibition opening this fall at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery.</p>
<p>Co-curated by assistant professor of art Enrique Leal and Sesnon director Shelby Graham, the show will feature 60 selected works from the <a href="http://www.parkettart.com/"><em><strong>Parkett <em>Collection</em></strong></em></a> housed at the University of Castilla, La Mancha (UCLM) School of Fine Arts and Contemporary Art Archives &amp; Collections, located in Cuenca, Spain.</p>
<p><em>Parkett</em> was a literary arts journal (1984-2017), presenting the work of prominent international artists with essays by writers and critics, that commissioned artists featured in the publication to create a work of art specifically for <em>Parkett</em>, produced in limited edition, signed, numbered and offered for purchase to subscribers.</p>
<p>Graham noted that UC Santa Cruz is the only public educational institution in the United States that is exhibiting this selection of work from the collection, which was donated to UCLM in 2009 by art collector Helga de Alvear in Madrid.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are borrowing these works from UCLM, where our art professor Enrique Leal taught for 20 years before moving to UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Graham. &#8220;He suggested we bring this to the Sesnon Gallery as a teaching opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Titled <em>Unique Multiples: Teaching with the Parkett Collection from the University of Castilla-La Mancha</em>, the exhibition will run at the Sesnon Gallery from October 2 through December 6. The artists featured include <strong>Andy Warhol, Cindy Sherman, Ai Weiwei, Kara Walker, Louise Bourgeois, Fischli/Weiss, Katharina Fritsch, Rebecca Horn, Ilya Kabakov, William Kentridge, Yayoi Kusama, Ernesto Neto, Beatriz Milhazes, Meret Oppenheim, Gabriel Orozco</strong>, and <strong>Sigmar Polke</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;An artist&#8217;s multiple is unique in that it is a limited-edition, comprising a small number of identical copies created by and produced by an artist alone or with a technician,&#8221; said Graham about the show's title. &#8220;It is a series traditionally rooted in printmaking and photography, but is not restricted to any single medium. In this exhibition, we are highlighting the diversity or unique approaches and use of materials/objects to making &#8216;contemporary multiples&#8217;<strong><em>.</em>&#8221;<em>&#160;</em></strong></p>
<p><em></em>Graham described the benefits to students of having the opportunity to view this type of exhibition.</p>
<p>&#8220;The artifacts and graphic works included in the renowned <em>Parkett Collection</em> offer an unparalleled occasion to examine the very premises of &#8216;unique multiples&#8217; as practiced by influential contemporary artists,&#8221; said Graham.&#160;&#8220;This is a perfect opportunity to walk through the exhibition and see if you recognize any of the artists.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We would like UC Santa Cruz students to consider what type of multiple they would make if asked to do this. <em>Parkett</em> essentially gave the artists an assignment to make an interesting multiple for their magazine subscribers. With this exhibition viewed as a teaching opportunity, students can learn from some of the greatest artists of our time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It's also a chance to see an Andy Warhol or Kara Walker up close, for free,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The exhibition kicks off on Wednesday, October 2, with an opening reception at the gallery from 5 to 7 p.m., including curators&#8217; remarks at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Other <a href="https://art.ucsc.edu/galleries/sesnon/events/opening-reception"><strong><em>related events</em></strong></a> include a screen printing performance on First Friday, October 4, from 12 to 5 p.m.; a <em>Parkett</em> Open House at McHenry Library&#8217;s Special Collections &amp; Archives on Tuesday, October 15, from 2 to 4 p.m.; a screen printing workshop<span><strong>&#160;</strong>for students </span>on multiples with Ry Faraola at Baskin Arts Courtyard on October 11-12; and ZineFest and Zine workshops<span><strong>&#160;</strong></span>on multiples with local professionals and students at Baskin Arts Courtyard on October 18-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <em>Parkett</em> Collection celebrates the public reception of art by democratizing the circulation of aesthetic images, objects and ideas,&#8221; noted art professor Leal. &#8220;From the everyday to the esoteric, the variety of narratives and mediums displayed empower audience&#8217;s understandings of contemporary art production.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We started research on this exhibition in 2014 before the final issue of <em>Parkett </em>was released in 2017 and quickly learned the depth and breadth of this cultural project,&#8221; Graham added. &#8220;We are delighted to take this opportunity to teach with the <em>Parkett</em> collection at UC Santa Cruz and expand the concept of contemporary multiples into a unique exhibition space and interactive archive for students and the community to explore.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>December 24, 25, 31 and January 1 are paid university holidays (if eligibility criteria are met)</li>
<li>December 26, 27 and 30 are curtailment days</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees may use vacation, accrued compensatory time off (CTO), or leave without pay (LWOP) for the curtailment days, scheduled for December 26, 27 and 30, 2019. For employees who may not have sufficient accumulated vacation hours, up to three (3) days of vacation leave may be used in advance of actual accrual during the winter curtailment period. In addition, those employees who are normally required to wait six (6) months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their accrued vacation hours even if the required waiting period has not been completed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility needed in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during winter curtailment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Units planning to maintain operations as usual during the winter curtailment period must receive approval from their respective principal officer or designee and should refer to the "Exceptions to Winter Curtailment" memo that will be coming from Physical Plant. This memo will explain the required procedure to ensure that heat is supplied to appropriate working areas. It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El receso de invierno del campus durante el periodo 2019-2020 est&#225; programado desde el martes, 24 de diciembre del 2019 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hasta el mi&#233;rcoles, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1&#186;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> de en</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ero del 2020:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los d&#237;as 24, 25 y 31 de diciembre del 2019 y el 1 de enero del 2020 son d&#237;as de descanso pagados en la universidad (si se cumplen los criterios de elegibilidad).&#160;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">El 26, 27 y 28 de diciembre del 2019 son d&#237;as de receso.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Para estos d&#237;as de receso, los empleados pueden solicitar vacaciones, utilizar tiempo libre compensatorio acumulado (CTO) o tomarlos como d&#237;as con permiso sin sueldo (LWOP). Los empleados que no tengan suficientes horas de vacaciones acumuladas pueden utilizar por adelantado hasta tres (3) d&#237;as de permiso para tomar vacaciones durante el per&#237;odo de receso del campus. Adem&#225;s, aquellos empleados que normalmente deban esperar seis (6) meses antes de utilizar sus vacaciones obtenidas por derecho, podr&#225;n utilizar sus horas de vacaciones acumuladas aun si el per&#237;odo de espera no se ha completado.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">En consideraci&#243;n de las distintas responsabilidades del personal acad&#233;mico y la flexibilidad para el cumplimiento de sus obligaciones, se anticipa que parte del personal acad&#233;mico continuar&#225; trabajando durante el receso del campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Las unidades que planean continuar con las operaciones normales durante el receso del campus tienen que recibir la aprobaci&#243;n de la autoridad correspondiente y deber&#225;n consultar el memorando &#8220;Excepciones por el cierre del campus&#8221; que la &#225;rea de Infraestructura F&#237;sica (Physical Plant) enviar&#225; pr&#243;ximamente.

<p>A vast halo of low-density gas extends far beyond the luminous part of a galaxy where the stars are concentrated. Although this hot, diffuse gas makes up more of a galaxy&#8217;s mass than stars do, it is nearly impossible to see. In November 2018, astronomers detected a fast radio burst that passed through the halo of a massive galaxy on its way toward Earth, allowing them for the first time to get clues to the nature of the halo gas from an elusive radio signal.</p>
<p>&#8220;The signal from the fast radio burst exposed the nature of the magnetic field around the galaxy and the structure of the halo gas. The study proves a new and transformative technique for exploring the nature of galaxy halos,&#8221; said J. Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and lead author of a paper on the new findings <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aay0073">published online September 26 in <em>Science</em></a>.</p>
<p>Astronomers still don&#8217;t know what produces fast radio bursts, and only recently have they been able to trace some of these very short, very bright radio signals back to the galaxies in which they originated. The November 2018 burst (named FRB 181112) was detected and localized by the instrument that pioneered this technique, CSIRO&#8217;s Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope. Follow-up observations with other telescopes identified not only its host galaxy but also a bright galaxy in front of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we overlaid the radio and optical images, we could see straight away that the fast radio burst pierced the halo of this coincident foreground galaxy and, for the first time, we had a direct way of investigating this otherwise invisible matter surrounding this galaxy,&#8221; said coauthor Cherie Day at Swinburne University of Technology, Australia.</p>
<p>A galactic halo contains both dark matter and ordinary (&#8220;baryonic&#8221;) matter, which is expected to be mostly hot ionized gas. While the luminous part of a massive galaxy might be around 30,000 light-years across, its roughly spherical halo is ten times larger. Halo gas fuels star formation as it falls in toward the center of the galaxy, while other processes (such as supernova explosions) can eject material out of the star-forming regions and into the galactic halo. One reason astronomers want to study the halo gas is to better understand these ejection processes, which can shut down star formation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The halo gas is a fossil record of these ejection processes, so our observations can inform theories about how matter is ejected and how magnetic fields are threaded through galaxies,&#8221; Prochaska said.</p>
<p>Contrary to expectations, the results of the new study indicate a very low density and a feeble magnetic field in the halo of this intervening galaxy.</p>
<p>&#8220;This galaxy&#8217;s halo is surprisingly tranquil,&#8221; Prochaska said. &#8220;The radio signal was largely unperturbed by the galaxy, which is in stark contrast to what previous models predict would have happened to the burst.&#8221;</p>
<p>The signal of FRB 181112 consisted of several pulses, each lasting less than 40 microseconds (ten thousand times shorter than the blink of an eye). The short duration of the pulses puts an upper limit on the density of the halo gas, because passage through a denser medium would lengthen the radio signals. The researchers calculated that the density of the halo gas must be less than a tenth of an atom per cubic centimeter (equivalent to several hundred atoms in a volume the size of a child&#8217;s balloon).</p>
<p>&#8220;Like the shimmering air on a hot summer&#8217;s day, the tenuous atmosphere in this massive galaxy should warp the signal of the fast radio burst. Instead we received a pulse so pristine and sharp that there is no signature of this gas at all,&#8221; said coauthor Jean-Pierre Macquart, an astronomer at the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research at Curtin University, Australia.</p>
<p>The density constraints also limit the possibility of turbulence or clouds of cool gas within the halo (&#8220;cool&#8221; being a relative term, referring here to temperatures around 10,000 Kelvin, versus the hot halo gas at around 1 million Kelvin). &#8220;One favored model is that halos are pervaded by clouds of clumpy gas. We find no evidence for these clouds whatsoever,&#8221; Prochaska said.</p>
<p>The FRB signal also yields information about the magnetic field in the halo, which affects the polarization of the radio waves. Analyzing the polarization as a function of frequency gives a &#8220;rotation measure&#8221; for the halo, which the researchers found to be very low. &#8220;The weak magnetic field in the halo is a billion times weaker than that of a refrigerator magnet,&#8221; Prochaska said.</p>
<p>At this point, with results from only one galactic halo, the researchers cannot say whether the unexpectedly low density and magnetic field strength are unusual or if previous studies of galactic halos have overestimated these properties. ASKAP and other radio telescopes will use fast radio bursts to study many more galactic halos and resolve their properties.</p>
<p>&#8220;This galaxy may be special,&#8221; Prochaska said. &#8220;We will need to use FRBs to study tens or hundreds of galaxies over a range of masses and ages to assess the full population.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Prochaska, Day, and Macquart, the coauthors of the paper include UCSC graduate student Sunil Simha and researchers at eight other institutions in Australia, the United States, South Korea, and Chile.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in the morning at Oakes College, groups of parents shoved, rolled, and dragged their children's possessions up a steep dirt path leading to their dorm rooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working together, families maneuvered large laundry hampers up stairwells, assembled fans, arranged photographs, and hefted boxes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move-in weekend requires emotional and physical stamina. There were plenty of advice sessions and reluctant goodbyes, as parents prepared to drive away.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My daughter&#8212;she is my princess,&#8221; said Frederick Martinez, who works as an insurance agent in Mexicali, Mexico. His daughter, Perla, who grew up in El Centro, California, plans to study theater arts. Martinez is very proud of her, &#8220;but leaving her will be hard.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But new arrivals met the challenge with enthusiasm. Personal touches, including the assistance of T-shirt-wearing, smiling student greeters, helped ease the transition.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Move-in can be really hectic,&#8221; said one of the greeters, Patrick Lee (Oakes '22, evolutionary biology). &#8220;We&#8217;re really trying to help expedite the process, and make everyone&#8217;s first day at college a little easier.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving in to college is such an important part of life, said Dani Barker, associate director of college student life operations at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;(Move-in) makes me nostalgic," she said. "It gives me goosebumps because these people, who have been taking care of their sons and daughters for 18 years, are handing them off to us. It&#8217;s a pivotal moment, and we get to be part of it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Welcoming diversity&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz expected to welcome more than 5,000 new students to the community over the course of the week.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A third of these </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new students (frosh and transfers) are first-generation college students, and about 31% of undergrads (new and returning) are from low-income backgrounds. Many have traveled a long way to get here with students hailing from 38 states and 29 different countries.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incoming frosh are: 3.6% African American, 1% American Indian, 38.9% Asian, 22.2% Hispanic/Latino, and 32% white. Incoming transfers are: 4.9% African American, 1.9% American Indian, 24.8% Asian, 30.2% Hispanic/Latino, and 36.9% white, according to preliminary campus figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important for UC Santa Cruz to make students from such diverse backgrounds feel welcome, said Mark Gardner, coordinator for residential education at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From day one, it is important for students to walk on over and see all different kinds of people at the check-in table, in the quad, in the dorm rooms,&#8221; said Gardner, who was greeting students and parents in the West Remote parking lot.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Dream catchers&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making the sudden adjustment to college life can be somewhat easier if you bring valued items that remind you of home. This was certainly the case with Samantha Gonzalez, who hails from Monterey Park, and brought some precious, crocheted &#8220;dream catchers&#8221;&#8212;intricate webbings of fabric inside a hoop-shaped frame.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These priceless items are made with materials from home, including a doily made by Samantha&#8217;s great grandmother, who died a few months ago.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I definitely wanted to fill this room with signs from home,&#8217;&#8217; said Samatha&#8217;s mother, Valerie Gonzalez. &#8220;For me, homesickness was one of the biggest starting hurdles. Hopefully, this will make it a little less.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samantha Gonzalez treasures the dream catchers&#8212;though she seemed much more excited than homesick during move-in day.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am comfortable with who I am,&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not looking to become a different person in college. I just want to strengthen the parts of me that are already there, including my commitment to social justice.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Surfing safari</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Samantha and Valerie were figuring out a place to hang the dream catchers, Samantha&#8217;s new roommate, Skylar Smith of Pacific Palisades, was seeking out a spot for her battered Sakal shortboard, which a friend of hers found on the side of a road and restored for her.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can you teach me how to surf?&#8221; asked Samantha.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course!&#8221; Skylar said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not the best. But I will teach you!&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the new roommates chatted, Skylar&#8217;s father, Dennis Smith, said he was excited for his daughter.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My wife and I think she&#8217;s ready to move on. Take the next step,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, stop being so metaphorical,&#8221; Skylar responded. &#8220;My mom and dad were like, &#8216;Get out of the house.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skylar Smith was not the only incoming Oakes first-year to tote a surfboard into a dorm room. Even in the midst of move-in, Gavin Christy of Bodega Bay made sure to check out the surf reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, he already had plans to get some surfing done that very evening. Christy said he&#8217;s not worried about balancing school work and surfing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing this since high school,&#8217;&#8217; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christy was pleased to find out that being a dedicated scholar and surfer is a vaunted tradition on campus. In fact, the university&#8217;s distinguished alumni include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">William Finnegan (Cowell &#8217;74, English literature), who did quite a bit of surfing in college. He went on to become a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Yorker</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> staff writer in 1987, and won a Pulitzer Prize for his memoir of surfing, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Other famous surfing alumni include big-wave surfers Sarah Gerhardt (Ph.D. '03, physical chemistry) and Ryan Seelbach (Kresge '92, Earth sciences; M.A. '93).&#160;</span></p>

<p>The draft policy is <a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/policiesinreview/draft-uc-copyright_faqs.pdf">available online</a>. Substantive changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expands eligibility to own copyrights.</strong> The definition of &#8220;Academic Authors&#8221; in the revised policy expands the pool of those eligible to own copyright.</li>
<li><strong>Expands and clarifies the pool of works eligible for copyright ownership.</strong> The policy provides a definition of &#8220;Scholarly &amp; Aesthetic Works&#8221; &#8211; a definition that does not exist in the existing policy. It also clarifies that software is a work for which eligible employees may own the copyright.</li>
<li><strong>Creates a definition for &#8220;Significant University Resources&#8221; as a limitation on the University&#8217;s ownership.</strong> The current policy has a broad definition of &#8220;University Resources,&#8221; which directs, in some instances, that the University asserts copyright ownership when the University&#8217;s resources contributed to the development of the copyright work. The revised policy now includes a key limitation such that the level of University resources must be &#8220;significant&#8221; and beyond the support provided to similarly-situated authors.</li>
<li><strong>Clarifies graduate student copyright ownership.</strong> The revised policy provides clarity regarding copyright ownership by graduate students of their theses, dissertations, and other copyrightable works.</li>
<li><strong>Clarifies copyright ownership for represented employees.</strong> The revised policy specifically states that if an inconsistency exists between a union employee&#8217;s collective bargaining agreement regarding copyright ownership and the revised policy, the copyright provisions of the union agreement prevail.</li>
<li><strong>Expands supplemental references.</strong> The revised policy expands the &#8220;Related Information&#8221; and &#8220;Revision History&#8221; sections to reference additional resources and other supplemental information.</li>
</ul>

The presenters portrayed a man with an able wit who knew how to leverage generous gifts to make big changes. <br/><br/>&#8220;Jack&#8217;s generosity and impact is truly unsurpassed at UC Santa Cruz, the City of Santa Cruz, and the Monterey Bay area,&#8221; Wolf said. &#8220;He has a knack for doing the right thing at the right time.&#8221;<br/><br/>Among these propitious acts was Baskin&#8217;s response to the floods that devastated several Santa Cruz County neighborhoods in 1982. Recognizing that the community lacked an institution to focus philanthropic resources on local causes, Baskin helped organize what is now Community Foundation Santa Cruz County.<br/>
<h3>&#8220;Jack is a feminist&#8221;</h3>
<a href="https://baskinfoundation.org/">Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation</a> Executive Director Nicole Baran, who is also Baskin&#8217;s granddaughter, emphasized Baskin&#8217;s deep concern with social issues. <br/><br/>&#8220;You may not think of a 100-year-old white man and feminism,&#8221; Baran said. &#8220;But after all these years, I can say Jack is a feminist.&#8221;<br/><br/>In foundation board meetings, Jack Baskin would be upset about the challenges of homeless women or immigrant families separated at the border, Baran said. And in addition to its support for UC Santa Cruz, the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation funds organizations that support and advocate for immigrants and low-income women.<br/><br/>&#8220;He recognizes his privilege came with responsibility,&#8221; Baran said. <br/><br/>Daughter Elaine Baskin said she holds her father as a role model who worked hard, invested wisely, and made a difference with his philanthropy. <br/><br/>Born to low-income parents who had immigrated from Russia, Baskin studied engineering and designed aircraft during World War II. After the war, Elaine Baskin explained, Jack Baskin knew returning soldiers would need homes. He moved to Los Angeles and became a general contractor, building tract houses. In the 1960s he moved to Santa Cruz and made a business of building housing throughout the Bay Area for seniors and low-income residents.<br/><br/>&#8220;He was proud of building quality homes,&#8221; Elaine Baskin said.<br/>
<h3>Bringing engineering to campus</h3>
Baskin served on the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board of Trustees for more than 30 years and advocated steadily for the campus to train engineers, said Professor Pat Mantey, who was the first dean of the engineering school. <br/><br/>With a $1 million gift in 1984, Baskin made it possible to establish an engineering department in what was then called the Applied Sciences building (now Engineering 1). Some of the funds were used to build dedicated space (now the Elena Baskin Visual Arts Center) for the Arts Division, which then occupied part of the building.<br/><br/>Baskin endowed a chair of computer engineering, which Mantey has held since 1988. The steady stream of funds enabled Mantey to direct resources to numerous projects, including the first high-power computers for the effort to sequence the human genome.<br/><br/>&#8220;With Jack&#8217;s money in my pocket I had freedom to do things I couldn&#8217;t do otherwise,&#8221; Mantey said.<br/><br/>In 1997, Baskin&#8217;s years of advocacy for engineering, along with a $5 million gift, culminated in the establishment of the Jack Baskin School of Engineering.<br/><br/>Following the presentations, numerous members of Baskin&#8217;s family mingled with faculty, staff, and community members. Baskin was not able to attend; however, his daughter Marianna Mejia and stepson Nicholas Baran said their father would have enjoyed the event. <br/><br/>&#8220;He&#8217;d probably be really proud,&#8221; Mejia said. &#8220;He&#8217;d be thinking about what else he could do.&#8221; <br/>
<h3>&#8220;Now I can give back&#8221;</h3>
Beatriz Collazo, a biomedical engineer, said she&#8217;d learned about the possibilities in engineering from <a href="https://gie.soe.ucsc.edu/girls-engineering">Girls in Engineering</a>, a program established with funds from the Baskin Foundation. The program provides math and science instruction for middle school girls in Watsonville and the Salinas Valley and an engineering summer camp at UC Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>She earned a degree at Stanford University and now builds medical devices at Duke Empirical. <br/><br/>&#8220;Girls in Engineering really helped launch my career,&#8221; Collazo said. &#8220;It helped me see engineering is more than programming, it&#8217;s problem solving.&#8221;<br/><br/>Another GIE aluma, Aleida Diaz Roque (Oakes &#8217;23, computer engineering), had her introduction to coding through the program. <br/><br/>Diaz Roque said members of her family have faced health problems, and part of her motivation to become an engineer is to build health-related technologies. <br/><br/>&#8220;I was inspired by Jack Baskin&#8217;s story, that his parents were immigrants like mine,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Now I can give back to my community, thanks to him.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/jack-baskin-featured.gif</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/jack-baskin-featured.gif</link><site>news</site><name>jack-baskin-featured.gif</name><display-name>jack-baskin-featured.gif</display-name><file-size>13322</file-size><width>500</width><height>240</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Jack Baskin</thumb-alt><title>Jack Baskin at 100</title><description>UC Santa Cruz celebrates the 100th birthday of Jack Baskin, a pivotal donor whose generosity has shaped the university and benefited causes throughout the Monterey Bay area</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5f50e844807270173ecef56be9882b73"><name>pangenome-project</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>NIH funds new centers to expand and diversify the human reference genome </title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute will play a leading role in the ambitious new Human Pangenome Reference Sequence Project.</summary><keywords>David Haussler, Karen Miga, Benedict Paten</keywords><start-date>1569337200000</start-date><display-name>NIH funds new centers to expand and diversify the human reference genome </display-name><path>/2019/09/pangenome-project</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/pangenome-project</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1569262200864</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1569336784536</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value><value>Silicon Valley</value><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/david-haussler-320.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/david-haussler-320.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>david-haussler-320.jpg</name><display-name>david-haussler-320.jpg</display-name><file-size>83555</file-size><width>320</width><height>388</height></image><image-alt>David Haussler</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/karen-miga-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/karen-miga-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>karen-miga-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>karen-miga-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26669</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Karen Miga</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>David Haussler directs the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/karen-miga-320.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/karen-miga-320.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>karen-miga-320.jpg</name><display-name>karen-miga-320.jpg</display-name><file-size>85998</file-size><width>320</width><height>415</height></image><image-alt>Karen Miga</image-alt><image-caption>Karen Miga directs the Data Production Center at UCSC for the Human Pangenome Project and is the co-lead of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup">Telomere-to-Telomere consortium</a> (T2T).

<p>The first human genome sequence, produced by the international Human Genome Project in 2000, was a landmark achievement that gave rise to the burgeoning field of genomic medicine. Improved and annotated over the years, that genome sequence (based mostly on one person's genome) has been an essential reference for making sense of new genomic data. But the current reference genome is still an incomplete sequence and woefully inadequate as a representation of human diversity and genetic variation.</p>
<p>The new project will address those shortcomings by creating a new &#8220;human pangenome reference&#8221; based on the complete genome sequences of 350 individuals. The project will be carried out by two new centers funded by the <a href="https://www.genome.gov">National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)</a>, part of the NIH.</p>
<p>"One human genome cannot represent all of humanity. The human pangenome reference will be a key step forward for biomedical research and personalized medicine. Not only will we have 350 genomes representing human diversity, they will be vastly higher quality than previous genome sequences," said David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz and director of the <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a>.</p>
<p>"It has grown more and more important to have a high-quality, highly usable human genome reference sequence that represents the diversity of human populations," said Adam Felsenfeld, NHGRI program director in the Division of Genome Sciences. "The proposed improvements will serve the growing basic and clinical genomics research communities by helping them interpret both research and patient genome sequences."</p>
<p>The two centers&#8212;a sequencing center and a reference center&#8212;are funded by separate grants. NHGRI has awarded approximately $3.5 million per year over a five-year period to UC Santa Cruz, with major collaborators including the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington University in St. Louis, and Rockefeller University in New York, to form the Human Pangenome Sequencing Center, which will aim to sequence up to 350 diverse human genomes using state-of-the-art technologies to incorporate high-quality sequences that are more broadly representative.</p>
<p>NHGRI also awarded $2.5 million per year for five years to three institutions&#8212;Washington University in St. Louis (WashU), UC Santa Cruz (UCSC), and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), which will coordinate with the National Center for Biotechnology Information&#8212;to form the WashU-UCSC-EBI Human Pangenome Reference Center. The center will provide a next-generation reference sequence of the human genome as a resource for the scientific community.</p>
<p><strong>Human Pangenome Project</strong></p>
<p>Together, these grants initiate a new Human Pangenome Reference Sequence Project, or "Human Pangenome Project."</p>
<p>Haussler said the project will push the capabilities of current DNA sequencing technology well beyond what has been attempted before. Directing the sequencing center will be Karen Miga, a research scientist at UCSC who co-led a team with Adam Phillippy (NHGRI) that recently achieved the first complete sequence of a human chromosome. This "telomere-to-telomere" assembly (telomeres are the very tips of the chromosomes) of a complete human X chromosome, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/735928v3">posted on the bioRxiv server in August</a>, shows that complete chromosome sequences with no gaps are possible using current technologies.</p>
<p>Nanopore sequencing, a sequencing technology pioneered at UC Santa Cruz and commercialized by Oxford Nanopore, is one of several advanced technologies enabling more complete and accurate genome sequencing that will be employed in this project. Oxford Nanopore and other leading DNA sequencing companies (Pacific Biosciences and Illumina) will be supporting the center as contributing partners, each bringing uniquely powerful technologies.</p>
<p>"We are going to use all of the latest and best sequencing technologies and push their capabilities to get the most complete and accurate sequences possible," Haussler said.</p>
<p>The other big challenge for the project will be creating a useful reference product from 350 individual genomes. "On their own, 350 separate genomes are not very useful as a reference," explained Benedict Paten, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC and a co-leader of the Human Pangenome Reference Center.</p>
<p>Paten and others have been working for several years to develop a new way to represent genomes that can serve as a comprehensive reference map of human genetic variation. The idea is to weave together a collection of genome sequences into a map that shows where they are the same and where they are different. This representation must also enable computational strategies for comparing any new genome sequence to the reference map.</p>
<p>"Our job is to build that representation and make it easy to use," Paten said. "It's a huge challenge to make it usable and computable. But it's very important, because if you rely on one reference genome for all comparisons, you are blind to many types of variations in human genomes."</p>
<p><strong>Longstanding collaborations</strong></p>
<p>The new centers will build on longstanding collaborations between the scientists at the participating institutions. The lead investigators for the Human Pangenome Sequencing Center include Evan Eichler at the University of Washington in Seattle, Ira Hall at Washington University in St. Louis, and Erich Jarvis at Rockefeller University. The UCSC participants in the genome sequencing, in addition to principal investigator David Haussler, include Karen Miga, Benedict Paten, Ed Green, and Mark Akeson.</p>
<p>The lead investigators for the Human Pangenome Reference Center include Ting Wang and Ira Hall at Washington University in St. Louis, Benedict Paten at UCSC, and Paul Flicek at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Other participants in the project include Richard Durbin at Cambridge University, Gene Myers at Max Plank Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Germany, Kirsten Howe at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in England, Adam Phillippy at NHGRI, Heng Li at the Broad Institute in Boston, Eimear Kenny at the Mount Sinai BioMe Biobank, Alissa Resch at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, and Paolo Carnevali at the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>"We have assembled a 'dream team' of the top scientists in genome assembly, sequencing, and comparison. It's a very ambitious project, but we have the expertise and experience to do this," Haussler said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5f8f3052807270173ecef56b7398f2ef"><name>colson-whitehead-reading-feature-2019</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tales of brutality and survival</title><summary>Pulitzer Prize-winning author Colson Whitehead enthralled a Santa Cruz crowd with stories from Nickel Boys, his new bestselling novel based on the horrifying true story of a notorious reform school in the Florida Panhandle. </summary><start-date>1569279600000</start-date><display-name>colsonwhiteheadsantacruz2019</display-name><path>/2019/09/colson-whitehead-reading-feature-2019</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/colson-whitehead-reading-feature-2019</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1569266282528</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1569281161091</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>American Studies</value><value>Literature</value><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/colsonwhiteheadreading350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/colsonwhiteheadreading350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>colsonwhiteheadreading350.jpg</name><display-name>colsonwhiteheadreading350.jpg</display-name><file-size>44376</file-size><width>350</width><height>261</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/colsonwhiteheadthumb80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/colsonwhiteheadthumb80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>colsonwhiteheadthumb80.jpg</name><display-name>colsonwhiteheadthumb80.jpg</display-name><file-size>16236</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Colson Whitehead enthralled the capacity crowd as he read from his new book, Nickel Boys, and spoke of the research that informed the novel.&#160; Photo by Crystal Birns.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Pulitzer Prize–winning author Colson Whitehead delved into the murderous history of Florida reform school in reading co-sponsored by Bookshop Santa Cruz and The Humanities Institute  
</article-subhead><article-text><br/>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nickel Boys</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the new novel by the Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning author Colson Whitehead, is based on the horrific true story of the Arthur G. Dozier School, which had a long and disturbing track record of abuse, unexplained deaths, safety violations, and sexual assaults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build his story, Whitehead drew from&#8212;and credited&#8212;newspaper reporters as well as the work of former inmates who have written about their experiences at Dozier. But Whitehead, during his riveting presentation last week at Peace United Church in Santa Cruz, admitted that he just couldn't bring himself to tour the ruins of the shut-down reform school as part of his research. The rage and dread were too much for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was going to go down there and I kept putting it off,&#8221; Whitehead told the capacity crowd at the reading, which was presented by Bookshop Santa Cruz and The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;When I thought about going down there, my heart got heavy, and I got depressed. I&#160; could not fly to Florida.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He got the idea for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nickel Boys</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a series of shocking newspaper reports about the school in the Florida Panhandle, which opened on New Year's Day in 1900, on the premise that it would offer education, practical skills, and rehabilitation for troubled youth as an alternative to locking them up as adult criminals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reality, the school was a botched effort. From the beginning, it was negligent and grossly mismanaged, Whitehead said. In 1903, investigators found that children as young as 6 had been shackled in solitary confinement. In 1914, a fire raced through the property, killing eight boys and two men. About 80 boys are known to have died at the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Over the years there were other investigations and talks of reform, and nothing happened,&#8221; Whitehead said. &#8220;Nothing really changed. They disassembled the sweat boxes where kids were baked in iron boxes in the sun. They stopped leasing kids to local businesses because sometimes they ended up dead. But always the problems returned.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major change did not take place until 2011, when newspaper reports put a lot of pressure on Dozier, Whitehead said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Finally stories of sexual abuse, torture, and even murder got the place closed down,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Survivors of the school&#8212;some of them in their 70s&#8212;talk about the ways the school has warped their lives. Some of them, to this day, are frightened of the dark.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audience gasped when Whitehead mentioned the report that first drew him into the world of Dozier: &#8220;In 2014 they were trying to sell the property and a team of archaeologists from the University of South Florida found 55 unmarked graves. Some had blunt trauma to their skulls.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nickel Boys </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tells the story of the fictional Nickel school through the friendship and conflicting perspectives of the two principal characters, the idealistic, studious Elwood, a great admirer of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the more cynical Turner.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elwood ends up in Nickel because he is hitchhiking on a road one day, and catches a ride with the driver of a stolen car who gets pulled over by a racist policeman. Deemed guilty by association, Elwood is given no chance to clear his name. The belief systems that define his life&#8212;&#8220;people are good, and things will turn out OK if I do the right thing&#8221;&#8212;face a sustained and brutal test.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most of the Dozier youth never got the justice they deserved, there is a kind of justice in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nickel Boys</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8217; success. An instant bestseller, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nickel Boys</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also wound up at the top of former President Barack Obama&#8217;s summer reading list, and was recently listed as a contender for the National Book Award.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitehead&#8217;s book offers a broader commentary &#8220;on any place where there is a culture of impunity, where people can get away with stuff, where no one is held accountable.&#8221; He said this principle applies to many other places and circumstances, from a notorious home for unwed mothers in Ireland to migrant camps in Texas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his introduction to Whitehead&#8217;s talk, UC Santa Cruz Humanities Dean and Distinguished Professor of History Tyler Stovall noted the strong continuity between</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nickel Boys</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Whitehead&#8217;s previous and best-selling novel to date, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Underground Railroad </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2016), in which Whitehead tells the story of the flight of a woman named Cora from a plantation in Florida, while making use of an otherworldy series of subterranean tunnels&#8212;a literalized, physical version of the metaphorical &#8220;Underground Railroad.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Underground Railroad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed how one brave woman tried to escape slavery, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nickel Boys</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed how slavery caught back up in many ways with African American communities in the years of the Civil Rights movement,&#8221; Stovall said.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="600b6b6d807270173ecef56b48e798dd"><name>arcs-scholars</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>ARCS Foundation scholarships support UCSC graduate students</title><summary>Fourteen UC Santa Cruz graduate students have received scholarships worth a total of $158,000 from the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation.</summary><start-date>1569222000000</start-date><display-name>ARCS Foundation scholarships support UCSC graduate students</display-name><path>/2019/09/arcs-scholars</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/arcs-scholars</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1569274424143</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1571345022167</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/arcs-logo.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/arcs-logo.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>arcs-logo.jpg</name><display-name>arcs-logo.jpg</display-name><file-size>26781</file-size><width>325</width><height>129</height></image><image-alt>ARCS logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/miguel-pinto-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/miguel-pinto-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>miguel-pinto-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>miguel-pinto-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18745</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Miguel Pinto</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/miguel-pinto-325.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/miguel-pinto-325.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>miguel-pinto-325.jpg</name><display-name>miguel-pinto-325.jpg</display-name><file-size>64118</file-size><width>325</width><height>368</height></image><image-alt>Miguel Pinto</image-alt><image-caption>Chemistry graduate student Miguel Pinto received the ARCS Foundation's Anniversary Award.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Fourteen UC Santa Cruz graduate students have received scholarships worth a total of $158,000 from the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation for the 2019-20 academic year.

<p>Curated by Micah Perks, professor of literature and co-director of the UCSC Creative Writing Program, the series runs through December 5 on Thursday nights at the Humanities Lecture Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;The writers that are coming this fall represent the most exciting vital experiments, at least in prose, right now--literary experiments that are mashups of autobiography, fairy tales, and speculative fiction,&#8221; said Perks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some examples are Peg Alford Pursell's flash fabulist autofiction, <em>A Girl Goes Into The Forest;</em> or Sophia Shalmiyev's <em>Mother Winter</em>, a folk and fairy tale inspired memoir; or R. Zamora Linmark's speculative autofiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I'm so looking forward to poet Marcelo Hernandez Castillo, and to his memoir coming out next year, which explores the ideas of separation from deportation, trauma, and mobility between borders,"&#160;she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I'm particularly excited about our reading, &#8220;After Ursula,&#8221; which will feature four brilliant writers, Molly Gloss, Nisi Shawl, Karen Joy Fowler and Kim Stanley Robinson, all mentored by Ursula Le Guin, who will read and talk about the state of speculative fiction after the loss of their beloved teacher and friend.&#8221;&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>The series kicks off on October 3 with <strong>R. Zamora Linmark</strong><span><strong>, </strong></span>the author of<span>&#160;</span><em>The Importance of Being Wilde at Heart</em>, his first novel for young adults. He has also published two novels,<span>&#160;</span><em>Rolling the R&#8217;s</em>, which he adapted for the stage, and<span>&#160;</span><em>Leche</em><span>, </span>as well as four poetry collections, most recently,<span>&#160;</span><em>Pop V&#233;rit&#233;</em>.</p>
<p>Poet, essayist, translator, and immigration advocate <strong>Marcelo Hernandez Castillo </strong>will read on October 10<strong>. </strong>He is the author of&#160;<em>Cenzontle</em>, selected by Brenda Shaughnessy as the winner of the 2017 A. Poulin Jr. prize and winner of the 2018 Northern California Book Award. Castillo&#8217;s first chapbook,&#160;<em>Dulce</em>, also won the Drinking Gourd Poetry&#160;Prize. His memoir,<em>&#160;Children of the Land</em>&#160;is forthcoming from Harper Collins in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Gary Soto</strong> will be the featured poet at the 10th annual <em>Morton Marcus Poetry Reading</em> on November 7, at the Music Center Recital Hall. He has published more than 40 books for children, young adults and adults, including<span>&#160;</span><em>Too Many Tamales, Chato&#8217;s Kitchen, Baseball in April</em>,<span>&#160;</span><em>Buried Onions</em><span><em>&#160;</em></span>and<span>&#160;</span><em>The Elements of San Joaquin</em>. He is also the author of<span>&#160;</span><em>In and Out of Shadows,</em><span><em>&#160;</em></span>a musical about undocumented youth and, most recently,<span>&#160;</span><em>The Afterlife</em>, a one-act play about teen murder and teen suicide. Soto&#8217;s poem &#8220;Oranges&#8221; is the most anthologized poem in contemporary literature. His books have sold four million copies nationally and have been translated into French, Japanese, Italian, Korean, and Spanish.</p>
<p>On November 14, four renowned writers--<strong> Karen Joy Fowler, Molly Gloss, Nisi Shawl and Kim Stanley Robinson</strong><strong>--</strong>will participate in a conversation centered around sci/fi speculative fiction author Ursula LeGuin, who recently died in 2018.</p>
<p>American science fiction writer <strong>Kim Stanley Robinson</strong> is the author of more than 20 books, including<span>&#160;</span><em>Red Moon, New York 2140, Aurora, Shaman, Green Earth</em>, and<span>&#160;</span><em>2312</em>.&#160;He was sent to the Antarctic by the U.S. National Science Foundation&#8217;s Antarctic Artists and Writers&#8217; Program in 1995, and in 2008 he was named a &#8220;Hero of the Environment&#8221; by<span>&#160;</span><em>Time</em><span>&#160;</span>magazine.&#160;Robinson works with the Sierra Nevada Research Institute, the Clarion Writers&#8217; Workshop, and UC San Diego&#8217;s Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination.&#160;His books have been translated into 25 languages, and won numerous awards in five countries, including the Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and World Fantasy awards.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz author <strong>Karen Joy Fowler</strong> is the author of six novels, including&#160;<em>Sarah Canary&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>The Jane Austen Book Club</em>, and three short story collections, including&#160;<em>What I Didn&#8217;t See. </em>Her most recent novel&#160;<em>We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves,</em>&#160;was published by Putnam in May 2013 and won the Pen Faulkner award that year.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Molly Gloss</strong> is the author of several novels, including&#160;<em>The Jump-Off Creek, The Dazzle of Day, Wild Life, The Hearts of Horses&#160;</em>and<em>&#160;Falling From Horses,&#160;</em>as well as the story collection&#160;<em>Unforeseen.&#160;</em>She writes both realistic fiction and science fiction, and her novels have received, among other honors, a PEN West Fiction Prize, an Oregon Book Award, two Pacific Northwest Booksellers Awards, the James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and a Whiting Writers Award.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Nisi Shawl</strong> wrote the 2016 Nebula finalist, <em>Everfair,</em> and the 2008 Tiptree Award-winning collection <em>Filter House</em>.&#160;In 2005, she also co-wrote <em>Writing the Other: A Practical Approach</em>, a standard text on inclusive representation in the imaginative genres.&#160;Her stories have appeared in such publications as <em>Strange Horizons</em> and <em>Asimov&#8217;s Science Fiction</em> magazine.&#160;She edited the anthology, <em>New Suns: Original Speculative Fiction by People of Color</em>; and co-edited <em>Stories for Chip: A Tribute to Samuel R. Delany</em> and <em>Strange Matings:</em> <em>Science Fiction, Feminism, African American Voices, and Octavia E. Butler</em>.&#160;</p>
<p>And on November 21, the series will present a double bill featuring <strong>Sophia Shalmiyev </strong>and <strong>Peg Alford Pursell.</strong></p>
<p>Portland writer Shalmiyev is an immigrant from the Soviet Union and the author of&#160;<em>Mother Winter</em>, which&#160;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em>&#160;has described as&#160;&#8220;a rich tapestry of autobiography and meditations on feminism, motherhood, art, and culture&#8230;as intellectually satisfying as it is artistically profound.&#8221; Shalmiyev earned an M.F.A. from Portland State University and a second master's degree in creative arts therapy from the School of Visual Arts. Her latest work can be found at <em>Lit Hub</em> and <em>Guernica</em>.&#160;</p>
<p>Pursell is the author of&#160;<em>A Girl Goes Into The Forest</em> and of <em>Show Her A Flower, A Bird, A Shadow,&#160;</em>the 2017 Indies Book of the Year for Literary Fiction. Her work has been published in a variety of journals and anthologies, including&#160;<em>Permafrost, Joyland,&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>the Los Angeles Review</em>. Most recently, her microfiction, flash fiction, and hybrid prose have been nominated for Best Small Microfictions and Pushcart Prizes. Purcell is the founder and director of&#160;WTAW Press, a nonprofit publisher of literary books, and of&#160;<em>Why There Are Words,</em>&#160;the national literary reading series.</p>
<p>All readings will take place on Thursdays at 7 p.m. in the Humanities Lecture Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus (except the November 7 Morton Marcus Poetry Reading, which will be at UCSC&#8217;s Music Center Recital Hall). Admission is free and open to the public.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This October, UC Santa Cruz will start construction on the first phase of its Kresge renewal project, with plans to add a new academic building and residence halls to the college, refurbish existing buildings, and provide accessibility.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus has already begun preparations for the project, which will initially focus on the northwest corner of Kresge. Visitors will notice some changes, including the installation of fencing around part of the north campus demarcating the Phase 1 project boundary.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The construction&#8212;the result of several years' worth of intensive planning&#8212;blends the renovation of existing buildings with new construction. The renewal project is designed to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">preserve the unique architectural and cultural flavor of the original Kresge while updating it to the needs of 21st century students, with a much-needed increase in residential capacity, classroom seats, and student support space.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to be at this point in the project, and exciting to start construction after working on this since 2015,&#8221; said Jolie Kerns, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz's campus planner.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is gratifying to deliver new housing for students, and new classrooms that meet the needs of today&#8217;s academic community, and to revitalize this cultural resource for the campus,&#8221; said Kerns, who is project manager for the Kresge Renewal.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renewal project is also designed to make Kresge feel more integrated with the rest of UC Santa Cruz, and less remote. A new academic building faces out, treehouse-style, across a ravine toward the main campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Board of Regents approved the project in March.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sixth college to open on campus, Kresge was built in 1973, occupying about eight acres of redwood forest. Designed by architect Charles Moore of Moore, Lyndon, Turnbull and Whitaker (MLTW) with landscape architect Dan Kiley, the college is a cluster of residential, academic, and student support buildings lining a meandering pedestrian street.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kresge received international coverage for its clustering of residential, academic and student support buildings nestled in a redwood forest,&#160; as well as its cutting-edge approach to education. This college community of stucco-covered structures also included spaces for informal student engagement organized around a pedestrian spine,&#160; including a &#8220;mayor&#8217;s stand&#8217;&#8217; for impromptu speeches and gatherings. Vertical openings on the buildings&#8217; false facades provided for exterior circulation and views.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the original college buildings have been showing plenty of wear more than 40 years after their construction. The majority of existing buildings are retained in the Kresge renewal project, as are many familiar landmarks, including the piazzetta, the mayor&#8217;s stand, and the &#8220;waterfall steps.&#8221;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site preparation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and construction begin this month for phase one of the project, set for completion in Fall 2021,&#160; in time for the start of the academic year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This two-year-long first phase of construction will include a cluster of three new residential buildings along Porter-Kresge Road and a new academic building, which will go up on the site of the current Town Hall. Two existing residential buildings will also be renovated.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Town Hall will be rebuilt and relocated to the southern end of the college in the second phase of the project. Phase one will also include the renovation of several other existing buildings for residential, college life, and student support spaces.&#160;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new residential halls for first year students will include large social lounges at the ground-floor level, and a new caf&#233; at the north residential hall building, which will open onto the academic plaza. Additional social lounges will be included at the ends of each floor.&#160; The renovated buildings will include apartments for continuing students and a new study lounge in the south end of building R4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Builders will also renovate and update the North Bridge, a pedestrian walkway connecting the future academic plaza to Heller Drive; the bridge will be rebuilt with an access ramp so students with mobility challenges can use it to access the college more quickly and conveniently, instead of having to travel across Porter-Kresge Road.&#160;That renovation will require the closing of the bridge for approximately nine months, starting in April 2020. It is expected to be back in use by January 2021.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans for the north section of the Kresge campus also include office space for the&#160; Kresge Academic Administration (provost&#8217;s offices), and Humanities, Arts and PB Sci Divisions; and more classrooms, including a 600-seat lecture hall, which would become the largest of its kind on campus; a 150-seat lecture hall; and 50- and 35-seat classrooms. A 48-seat computing lab is also included.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project uses renewable materials, including cross-laminated timber for the new residential halls and academic building; harvests and reuses captured stormwater for irrigation and toilet flushing; requires no fossil fuel combustion for space and water heating; and is designed to maximize energy efficiency, all to help with the longevity of Kresge, Kerns said. She noted that the retrofitted and new construction will achieve LEED Gold certification for sustainability.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall Kresge project, set for completion in 2023, will add new spaces for student life and support, including student co-ops, study areas and flexible meeting rooms; easier access for students and visitors with disabilities; and an increase in bed spaces from 368 to approximately 550.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project would also grow the footprint of Kresge from approximately 133,000 to 200,000 square feet.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kresge College will remain operational, with the construction process being phased to keep beds online and residential life and academic programs ongoing.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inevitably, a project of this scope will impact the Kresge community. For example, the Porter-Kresge access road will remain closed for the next two years.&#160; But UC Santa Cruz is phasing out the building project to minimize impacts as much as possible, Kerns said. Noise impacts from construction will be restricted to the daytime.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will have mitigations for noise, including screening at existing buildings being impacted,&#8221; Kerns noted. &#8220;We are working with Kresge College staff to identify alternative spaces for study if&#160; needed. It is important to note that this is a huge project, immediately adjacent to classrooms and residential space.&#160;<span>We work with the academic calendar and try to align construction activities that are the most disruptive to students, staff, faculty with summer or winter breaks so as to minimize adverse impacts.&#160;</span>We will continue to work with the Kresge community to make sure we have as little impact on college programs&#160; as possible.&#8221;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toward that end, she noted that there will continue to be Town Hall open forums throughout construction, to provide information about the project, updates on construction, and public discussion.&#160; These are scheduled this Fall in October, November and December.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction will take place roughly from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Planners will give residents updates week by week to give them a sense of upcoming work.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classes will continue at Kresge during all phases of construction.&#160;</span></p>

<p>We thank the courageous people who stepped forward to report their experiences to our Title IX Office and participated in the adjudication process. Our campus is a safer place because of their bravery.</p>
<p>The misconduct, <a href="images/gb-title-ix-investigation-report.pdf">confirmed through our investigation and adjudication process</a>, harmed the complainants, and that trauma rippled through our campus and university system undermining our ability to carry out the mission and central functions of the university. Our campuses must be safe and supportive environments to serve our students and succeed in our educational mission.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The journalist and bestselling author Malcolm Gladwell began his new book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking to Strangers, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with a desire to make sense of the death of Sandra Bland. Bland, a 28-year-old African American woman who was pulled over in a routine traffic stop in 2015 and committed suicide in a jail cell three days later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gladwell, a longtime staff writer at the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Yorker</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> magazine, shared an essential question about the Bland case before an audience of 1,500 people at the San Mateo Performing Arts Center on Saturday: &#8220;How did a simple conversation go so badly awry?&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking to Strangers, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gladwell uses Bland&#8217;s tragic death as a jumping-off point in his tour of missed cues and startling miscommunications</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his hour-and-a-half-long presentation, Gladwell presented controversial material with the relaxed and disarming style he&#8217;s become known for as a public speaker and podcaster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the book starts with the Bland case, Gladwell focused his talk on other topics, weaving in stories of Cuban spies, disgruntled whistleblowers, the Bernie Madoff scandal, and what it&#8217;s like to get a phone call from President Barack Obama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the event was presented in partnership with The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz and Bookshop Santa Cruz, it was held in Silicon Valley at Gladwell&#8217;s request. Gladwell began his talk by pointing out some of the challenges the area still faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s exhilarating to be in Silicon Valley where the smartest minds in the world are trying to solve the world&#8217;s biggest problems, with the exception of housing and traffic,&#8221; Gladwell said, drawing a big laugh from the crowd.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the talk, he spent the day on the Peninsula, and couldn&#8217;t help poking a little fun at the area&#8217;s reputation for status and wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Menlo Park there&#8217;s a road called Middle Avenue,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Google maps updates it to Upper Middle Avenue. And Waze just says it&#8217;s the best road.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The humorous asides were a counterbalance to some of the more sensitive material he covered during the evening, including the role that alcohol played in the case of Brock Turner, the former Stanford University swimmer who was convicted of sexually assaulting a woman while she was unconscious. He faced up to 14 years in prison but wound up serving just three months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman, Chanel Miller, stepped forward and publicly identified herself this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That chapter is set in Silicon Valley, and Gladwell said that when he decided to write about, it made a lot of people quite nervous.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think that there&#8217;s a way to do that chapter that is problematic,&#8221; said Gladwell. "I think I did it in a way that is not. But that&#8217;s a judgment you will have to make.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gladwell has spent his career writing about science and society, and is the author of five bestselling books, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tipping Point</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outliers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blink</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the Dog Saw,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">David and Goliath</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gladwell&#8217;s books have become cultural touchstones, often changing the way we think about human behavior,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive, who introduced Gladwell.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking to Strangers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is proving to be no different, she said. &#8220;It challenges us to consider how we interact with people whose assumptions, perceptions, and backgrounds are different from our own. As the leader of an institution that celebrates diversity and fosters inclusivity, there&#8217;s no more valuable discussion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book&#160; looks at how the Bland case is a tragic example of a failure to communicate. It also examines the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">paradoxes that are at the heart of human society regarding the tendency to accept the statements of other people as givens.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gladwell narrowed the focus of his talk to hone in on the question of how human beings, even those who we think of as intelligent and highly trained, can be so easily deceived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Evolution has selected us to trust,&#8220; he said. Humans have &#8220;a default to truth&#8221;&#8212;where we tend to believe what we are told until the evidence gets so high that it can&#8217;t be ignored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t care where you go, you&#8217;ll find that human beings are easily duped,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of his quest in the book is to set out to discover why people haven&#8217;t learned to be better at figuring out when others are lying to them. Shouldn&#8217;t we have adapted to spot the liars our society?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gladwell said the opposite is true.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The only way to build productive organization and motivate people is to believe in them.&#8221; The downside is that we will occasionally be misled, but our capacity to trust allows us to live our lives and participate in community, said Gladwell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The reason we&#8217;ve been fooled isn&#8217;t because we&#8217;ve done something wrong,&#8221; said Gladwell. &#8220;It&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve done something fundamentally right.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="64a7f6e6807270173ecef56b4c48b8a7"><name>fall-transit</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2019-2020 UCSC Campus Transit, Parking and METRO Bus Service</title><summary>As our UC community gears up for the 2019-2020 academic year, below is some information regarding campus transportation options including Campus Transit, campus parking, and Santa Cruz METRO Bus service to and from UCSC.  &#13;

Now, a new website provides easy access to the full range of UCSC's "living labs," with program descriptions, links to websites, and contact information.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ucsc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Shortlist/index.html?appid=5d13175cc8364eefa1b9125316008e03">UC Santa Cruz Living Labs Map</a> is an interactive map that provides links to a wide range of programs organized into six categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agroecology</li>
<li>Design &amp; Engineering</li>
<li>Environmental Education</li>
<li>Environmental Justice and Sustainability</li>
<li>UCSC Natural Reserves</li>
<li>Stewardship &amp; Natural History</li>
</ul>
<p>Alex Jones, campus natural reserves manager, worked with UCSC undergraduates Jon-Mychal Cox and Sarina Sylavong to create the new website using the Esri Story Map platform. Each living lab is marked on an interactive map and includes a program description and information about ways for students to get involved.</p>
<p>"UCSC has so many great opportunities for students to get involved with hands-on learning. We're hoping this tool makes these programs more accessible, and that we can highlight more and more programs as time goes on," Jones said.</p>

Or teeth. Or femurs.</p>
<p>Zihlman made her mark on the study of human evolution by focusing on whole bodies, and she didn't want to revert to the standard piecemeal approach just to please a publisher. So she wrote the book she wanted to write and published it herself.</p>
<p>The result is a 450-page volume that presents the "big picture" of what she has learned about human origins from her painstakingly thorough study of modern ape anatomy over the last four decades.</p>
<p>Not content with the study of fossils, Zihlman began early in her career to study the soft tissue of contemporary animals, hunting for clues to the mechanics of locomotion. Her book also takes a "whole animal" approach, presenting detailed analyses of bones, muscles, and tendons to showcase how all the parts work together.</p>
<p><em>Ape Anatomy and Evolution </em>is unlike conventional textbooks, which typically focus on one body part or one body system. Zihlman adds another layer of complexity by comparing the anatomy of the four major apes: gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and gibbons.</p>
<p>"I wanted to illustrate the idea that human evolution shares so much with the apes&#8212;and also give a counter to that by illustrating where the differences are," said Zihlman, a professor emerita of anthropology who retired in 2012. Traditional anatomy books are "very narrow, very technical, very boring," she added. "You never get a sense of the whole animal. My underlying principle was a desire to understand their evolution and adaptation, and to give readers a sense of where the animals lived, how they moved, and what their particular ecological niche was."</p>
<p>Zihlman and her long-time collaborator Carol E. Underwood spent more than a decade working on the book; Underwood created dozens of lavish illustrations and graphics that are featured throughout the volume. "It's a really different book," said Zihlman. "It was risky. A colleague said we're doing something so different that it's going to take a while for it to be successful."</p>
<p>Zihlman, who joined the faculty in 1967, was drawn to the challenge by what she believes it offers readers&#8212;students, researchers, and a lay audience, as well. "After all this work, I feel I'm really beginning to understand the apes and the lessons they have to tell us," she said. "I can't help but always be the educator and try to put it all together."</p>
<p>The muscles and bones associated with locomotion account for two-thirds of an ape's body mass. Much of the study of evolution has focused on the skeleton&#8212;skull, teeth, and limb bones&#8212;which adds up to less than 15%, she said.</p>
<p>"Paleontologists use two or three bones to reconstruct locomotion, which is limited," said Zihlman. "You need the whole skeleton, and the muscles, and the locomotion anatomy, and the range of variation that you only get by looking at numerous individuals."</p>
<p><strong><em>Bwana, Zihlman's first gorilla</em></strong></p>
<p>Zihlman's investigation of primate anatomy really took off with Bwana, a male silverback gorilla that died in captivity in 1994 at the San Francisco Zoo. She could hardly believe her good fortune when she was offered the body to dissect.</p>
<p>Word of Zihlman's unique approach spread over time, and she eventually acquired and dissected more than 20 gorillas, 20 pygmy chimpanzees, nearly 30 gibbons, and several orangutans. The lab where she did this pathbreaking work has since been named the Adrienne Zihlman Laboratory in honor of her contributions.</p>
<p>Zihlman made the most of each opportunity, and she generated an unprecedented amount of information about each animal: bone measurements and soft tissue analysis, which she was often able to combine with detailed zoo records of the life history of individual animals. "It's so rare to have all that about one individual," she noted. "People do individual muscle weights, but they don't study the bone. Or they study the bone but ignore the soft tissue. Or they don&#8217;t know about injuries suffered during an animal&#8217;s lifetime, and how it might permanently affect the animal&#8217;s anatomy."</p>
<p><strong><em>Similarities and differences </em></strong></p>
<p>Putting it all together allowed Zihlman to see important patterns.</p>
<p>"It looks like male apes and female apes have a lot in common with each other across species," said Zihlman. "Males are always heavier than females, and they always have more muscle. They're bigger in the upper body."</p>
<p>What accounts for the difference? Females' body systems mature earlier than males, so females cease growing&#8212;their bones fuse and they reach adult weight sooner, whereas males continue to add muscle before their bones fully fuse. "We've known that, but to see the sex differences patterned across the ape species was wonderful," she said.</p>
<p>Endlessly fascinated by anatomy, Zihlman said species differences between gorillas and orangutans in bone length and limb mass of arms and hands align with behavior: "Orangutans have more muscle mass in their hands and feet, because of how they move solely in the trees. They don't knuckle-walk on the ground, like gorillas do. Orangutans are all about clambering through the trees, grasping onto branches and vines," she said, adding, "You can start connecting the signature of distinctive orangutan anatomy with the behavior to better understand the patterns and unique adaptations."</p>
<p>Conventional anatomical literature is too "reductionist and piecemeal," making it difficult to understand an animal's locomotor potential, according to Zihlman.</p>
<p><strong><em>"Knowing the anatomy makes the behaviors more understandable"</em></strong></p>
<p>Even students and researchers who study primates in the field benefit from a deep understanding of anatomy, said Zihlman.</p>
<p>"If you know what the underlying body structure is, knowing the anatomy makes the behaviors more understandable when apes move&#8212;their postures while feeding, why they follow certain pathways through the forest, climb or leap across the canopy," she said. "In a very accessible way, this book shows field researchers what their subjects are all about beneath the skin."</p>
<p>Understanding anatomical structures and the possible range of locomotor behaviors sheds light on each group&#8217;s adaptations and how species can live together&#8212;"how chimpanzees have adjusted to compete with gorillas, why gibbons don't directly compete with closely related siamangs," added Zihlman.</p>
<p>It also enriches the story of human origins. Molecular data has established chimpanzees as our closest relative, but Zihlman develops the physical evidence in the locomotor anatomy and behavior of the two chimpanzee species. Finally, Zihlman is delighted by the prospect of her work being part of the contemporary discussion of human origins, which encompasses ecology, evolution, new molecular data, and anatomy.</p>
<p>"It's gratifying to make this information accessible," said Zihlman, who also wrote <em>The Human Evolution Coloring Book</em> and co-edited <em>The Evolving Female</em>. "This book summarizes our methodology and decades of lab dissections, and we think it will be a useful teaching and learning tool for anthropology students, and professionals."</p>
<p>That said, Zihlman's work is far from done. "There's a lot of original data in this book&#8212;but it's not nearly what we've got." Zihlman and Underwood are analyzing their data, developing new hypotheses about our fossil ancestors, and writing journal articles. And if that's enough, Zihlman is already working on another book, this one more of a memoir about "adventures in science."</p>

<p>All this and more can be expected to get worse in the coming decades, according to the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/srocc/"><em>Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate</em></a> released on Wednesday, September 25, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>
<p>"We have to deal with the fact that climate change is occurring now, and there will be impacts to human society. But if we take action now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we can lessen those impacts," said Raphael Kudela, professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz and an author of the IPCC Special Report.</p>
<p>Kudela is a lead author of the report's first chapter, which provides framing and context, and he also reviewed content in other chapters. For this special report, more than 100 scientists from 36 countries assessed the latest scientific knowledge about the impacts of climate change on ocean, coastal, polar, and mountain ecosystems, and the human communities that depend on them.</p>
<p>Contributors to the chapter on ocean ecosystems include Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of UCSC's <a href="https://ims.ucsc.edu/">Institute of Marine Sciences</a> (IMS), and Kristy Kroeker, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. IMS research scientist Siddharth Narayan contributed to the chapter on sea level rise and adaptation responses.</p>
<p><strong>Unprecedented and enduring changes</strong></p>
<p>The report on oceans and the cryosphere (meaning parts of the Earth that are frozen) is the third in a series of special reports produced in the IPCC&#8217;s Sixth Assessment Cycle. It highlights the urgency of prioritizing timely, ambitious, and coordinated action to address unprecedented and enduring changes in the ocean and cryosphere.</p>
<p>Global warming has already reached 1&#176;C above the pre-industrial level, due to past and current greenhouse gas emissions. There is overwhelming evidence that this is resulting in profound consequences for ecosystems and people. The ocean is warmer, more acidic and less productive. Melting glaciers and ice sheets are causing sea level rise, and coastal extreme events are becoming more severe.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we reduce emissions sharply, consequences for people and their livelihoods will still be challenging, but potentially more manageable for those who are most vulnerable,&#8221; said IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee in a statement. &#8220;We increase our ability to build resilience and there will be more benefits for sustainable development.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kudela said the new report's findings include climate-related changes scientists are seeing now on marine organisms and ecosystems. Warming and changes in ocean chemistry are already disrupting species throughout the ocean food web, with impacts on marine ecosystems and the people who depend on them, the report said.</p>
<p>"We are seeing impacts to biology, such as marine organisms moving toward the poles in response to ocean warming, and that is impacting fisheries," Kudela said. "The report also finds that harmful algal blooms are clearly increasing because of climate change."</p>
<p>To date, the ocean has taken up more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate system. By 2100, the ocean will take up 2 to 4 times more heat than between 1970 and the present if global warming is limited to 2&#176;C, and up to 5 to 7 times more at higher emissions. Ocean warming reduces mixing between water layers and, as a consequence, the supply of oxygen and nutrients for marine life.</p>
<p>Sea level rise has accelerated in recent decades due to increasing rates of ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, as well as continued loss from glaciers and expansion of ocean water as it warms. Increases in tropical cyclone winds and rainfall, and increases in extreme waves, combined with sea level rise, are exacerbating coastal flooding and other hazards. Marine heat waves and extreme El Nin&#771;o and La Nin&#771;a events are also projected to become more frequent.</p>
<p>Risks of severe impacts on biodiversity and coastal ecosystems increase under high emissions scenarios, including high risks for sensitive ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and kelp forests. Coral reefs are already at high risk and are projected to be at very high risk even if global warming is limited to 1.5&#176;C.</p>
<p>Although time is running out, it is still possible to lessen many of the projected impacts of climate change, Kudela said. "Under the lower emissions scenarios, the projections are not as bad. But if we wait ten years to take action, the impacts will be that much worse," he said. "Anything we do now is better than nothing."</p>
<p>According to the report, which was approved on September 24 by the 195 IPCC member governments, "Enabling climate resilience and sustainable development depends critically on urgent and ambitious emissions reductions coupled with coordinated sustained and increasingly ambitious adaptation actions."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6965b47f807270173ecef56b79bb632b"><name>stacy-jupiter-macarthur</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna Stacy Jupiter wins coveted MacArthur Fellowship</title><summary>Stacy Jupiter, a marine scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society who earned her Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz in 2006, is among the 26 new MacArthur Fellows for 2019.</summary><start-date>1569394800000</start-date><display-name>Alumna Stacy Jupiter wins coveted MacArthur Fellowship</display-name><path>/2019/09/stacy-jupiter-macarthur</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/stacy-jupiter-macarthur</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1569431336038</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1569955556587</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/stacy-jupiter-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/stacy-jupiter-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stacy-jupiter-400.jpg</name><display-name>stacy-jupiter-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>193446</file-size><width>400</width><height>481</height></image><image-alt>Stacy Jupiter</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/stacy-jupiter-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/stacy-jupiter-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stacy-jupiter-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>stacy-jupiter-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17238</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Stacy Jupiter</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UCSC alumna Stacy Jupiter is director of the Melanesia Program for the Wildlife Conservation Society.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/jupiter-villagers-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/jupiter-villagers-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jupiter-villagers-400.jpg</name><display-name>jupiter-villagers-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>96394</file-size><width>400</width><height>265</height></image><image-alt>Stacy Jupiter with villagers</image-alt><image-caption>Jupiter works with villagers in Melanesia on conservation programs.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Stacy Jupiter, a marine scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society who earned her Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz in 2006, is among the 26 new MacArthur Fellows for 2019. The prestigious MacArthur fellowships, awarded annually by the <a href="https://www.macfound.org/">John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation</a> for &#8220;extraordinary originality and dedication,&#8221; come with a no-strings-attached award of $625,000 over five years.</p>
<p>Jupiter, 43, lives in Fiji and works on conservation programs in Melanesia, which includes the countries of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, and encompasses nearly 2,000 islands. Melanesia's extraordinary biodiversity underscores the importance of conservation efforts in the region.</p>
<p>Jupiter's work involves integrating local cultural practices with field research to develop conservation solutions that protect both the biodiversity of coastal ecosystems and the well-being of communities dependent on them. Working in concert with local communities, Jupiter is establishing and applying new approaches to natural resource management based on traditional ecological knowledge and practices that take into account the livelihoods and food security of inhabitants.</p>
<p>&#8220;My work focuses on understanding the impacts of environmental change and using the outcomes to reconnect people to nature so that they will make smarter decisions that both protect the planet and improve human well-being,&#8221; Jupiter said in a statement. &#8220;The Pacific islands offer tremendous opportunities for teaching lessons to the world about environmental sustainability through reinvigorating customary knowledge and practice and building on people&#8217;s strong cultural attachment to place.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz, Jupiter worked in northern Australia studying how coastal mangroves and coral reefs were affected by land use in a major watershed in Queensland. Biology Professor Donald Potts, who was her adviser, described her as very easy going, with remarkable abilities to communicate at the right levels for different people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I've seen her equally comfortable sitting on the ground playing with village children and a few minutes later in formal discussions with the elders and government officials&#8212;and this was as a graduate student,&#8221; Potts said.</p>
<p>To build broad-based local support of conservation efforts, Jupiter creates tailored materials to communicate with different audiences, including comic books and puppet shows to teach children about marine conservation, scientific reports that inform national policy on coastal fisheries, and guides on best practices for holistic resource management in the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>The primary method used by Melanesian communities to manage coral reef natural resources is periodic closures to fishing (known as <em>tabu</em>). Jupiter joined villagers in experimental harvests and provided clear scientific evidence of the efficacy of their approach, as well as the means for communities to make more informed decisions about when, where, and how long to close off areas of the reef.</p>
<p>Her research has the potential for improving the sustainability of thousands of <em>tabu</em> areas across the southwestern Pacific, and Jupiter is spearheading efforts to link these locally managed marine areas to larger-scale marine planning processes.</p>
<p>Jupiter has been affiliated with the Wildlife Conservation Society since 2008. She served as director of the Fiji Country Program from 2009 to 2014 before assuming her current role as director of the Melanesia Program.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/09/25/763456317/genius-grant-goes-to-marine-scientist-who-embraces-flash-mobs-and-comic-books</url><title>'Genius' Grant Goes To Marine Scientist Who Embraces Flash Mobs And Comic Books</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/09/images/stacy-jupiter-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/09/images/stacy-jupiter-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stacy-jupiter-featured.jpg</name><file-size>41702</file-size><width>400</width><height>192</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Stacy Jupiter</thumb-alt><title>Alumna Stacy Jupiter wins coveted MacArthur Fellowship</title><description>Jupiter's work involves integrating local cultural practices with field research to develop conservation solutions.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6a4b6d17807270173ecef56bc5a56bc5"><name>chancellor-welcome</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New academic year, new possibilities</title><start-date>1569394800000</start-date><display-name>Fall 2019 welcome</display-name><path>/2019/09/chancellor-welcome</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/chancellor-welcome</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1569446391036</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1569521998278</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>To students, staff, and faculty new to campus, welcome! I count myself among you &#8212; a new arrival excited to get the academic year started. I&#8217;ve been anticipating this new beginning for months. I am thrilled to be here, grateful for your warm reception, and energized by the opportunities I see for our campus. To those who are returning to campus, welcome back! I hope you all had a great summer break and are energized, ready to embrace the opportunities that a new beginning affords.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is an extraordinary place, a campus where you will find countless opportunities to pursue your passions &#8212; academic, professional, and personal. Our 2,000-acre campus itself is special. As we begin our journey together, I would like to acknowledge that the land on which we gather is the traditional and unceded territory of the Uypi Tribe of the Awaswas Nation. I also would like to share the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/land-acknowledgement/">UC Santa Cruz Land Acknowledgement</a> developed in partnership with the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band. I encourage you to use this statement as you host events and gather on our campus to recognize both the history of colonization and the enduring relationship to the land and stewardship by the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band.</p>
<h2>A campus that makes a difference</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was just recognized by U.S. News and World Report as the No. 2 university in the country for student social mobility. This new ranking recognizes universities that graduate a large percentage of students from low-income households.</p>
<p>I am extremely proud to see the efforts of our students, staff, and faculty recognized. Together, low-income and first-generation students comprise roughly a third of our student body. UC Santa Cruz is committed to providing a high-quality education that can transform the lives of students from all backgrounds and to supporting students throughout their college journeys. Our campus community has long known of our strong commitment. Now many others do, too.</p>
<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>Roughly 5,200 new students joined our campus community over the past week, and I am proud they have chosen us. We are a California institution at our core &#8212; roughly 86 percent of our new arrivals are Californians &#8212; but I am delighted that we are becoming a truly global campus. Our new students hail from 29 countries. That diversity helps create global citizens. It benefits our research and scholarship. Breakthroughs and knowledge creation occur when someone looks closely at a problem through a different lens.</p>
<h2>Convocation</h2>
<p>Celebrating new students is vitally important. We must build a strong sense of community and inclusivity right from the start. What better way to usher new students into our Banana Slug community than with a festive, student-focused convocation? I am thrilled to be bringing back this annual tradition. I don&#8217;t need a chancellor-investiture ceremony to mark my start here. It&#8217;s much more important that our students have a positive event to launch them on their UCSC journeys. A convocation demonstrates inclusiveness, celebrates our scholarly pursuits, and highlights our focus on student success. I will be wearing my Banana Slug attire and cheering loudly. Staff members in the colleges will be guiding all new transfer and first-year students to the convocation this Friday.</p>
<h2>My priorities</h2>
<p>Opportunity and access are huge parts of my vision for UC Santa Cruz. My parents didn&#8217;t go to college. I came from humble beginnings in Deadwood, South Dakota. I know the challenges so many of our students face inside and outside the classroom because I lived them. And now I am so proud to be chancellor of one of the jewels in the University of California system. I am walking proof that higher education can transform lives. I want to put our students in positions to succeed wildly in whatever fields they choose.</p>
<p>I will also focus my early work on solidifying our status as a leader in research and creative scholarship. We must work together in our pursuit of research funding and build on the framework of our recently completed Strategic Academic Plan. A larger, more diverse faculty and graduate student population also will help cement our academic reputation.</p>
<p>Organization and processes aren&#8217;t subjects that typically generate a lot of buzz, but I believe some judicious organizational changes and streamlined processes will pay dividends for our campus.</p>
<p>Finally, we must proactively address inclusivity. Creating an inclusive campus climate is foundational to my vision for UC Santa Cruz. It&#8217;s why you will see me out and about on campus, talking to students, staff and faculty &#8212; and when you do, please come up to say hello. I want to know how you&#8217;re doing. Our campus community is a collection of microclimates, and the weather can feel markedly different depending on the climate you are in. Together we must create a community that celebrates differences, welcomes all, and works in common purpose.</p>
<p>To succeed as a campus, we all must learn to understand issues from different perspectives. That means addressing underlying, often-unconscious assumptions. It requires challenging, honest conversations. The payoff, though, will be immense as we find common ground and hammer out solutions to our many global challenges. Join me in this effort.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all during this 2019&#8211;2020 academic year, and I will see you around campus!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Cindy</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia K.

The Center, located in the Bay Tree Building room 106, will be open daily from 6:00 am until 9:00 pm. As noted in an earlier </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/03/meditation-space.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campus announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this space in Quarry Plaza offers students, staff, and faculty a quiet space to pursue spiritual well-being through prayer, meditation, and contemplative practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opening of the center follows a series of dialogues in Spring 2019 with an array of campus stakeholders, including the </span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/get-involved/interfaith-council.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University Interfaith Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and leaders of multiple student organizations focusing on religion, spirituality, faith, and meaning-making. These dialogues informed initial preparations of the space which took place during the spring and summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dean of Students Office will convene a representative group of UCSC community members with whom to collaborate in ongoing decision-making about the use and oversight of this new campus resource. If you are interested in joining such a group, please contact Brian Arao, Associate Dean of Students and Chief of Staff (</span><a href="mailto:barao@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">barao@ucsc.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> | 831.459.3793).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the Politics Department hosts a quiet space for students, staff, and faculty on the first floor of the Merrill Academic Building. Merrill 7B is open Monday through Friday from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm for prayer, reflection, meditation, and silence.</span></p>

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The NIH Director&#8217;s Awards are prestigious awards given to exceptionally creative scientists proposing high-risk, high-impact research and were created to support unconventional approaches to major challenges in biomedical and behavioral research. The New Innovator Award, established in 2007, supports unusually innovative research from early-career investigators.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sharma, who joined the UCSC faculty in 2018, studies the mysterious process by which the effects of environmental stresses can be transmitted from one generation to the next. Several lines of evidence suggest, for example, that a father's diet or experience of famine can affect the health and longevity of his children and grandchildren. These effects are not the result of mutations or other genetic changes to the DNA passed down in the chromosomes, but are thought to be mediated by &#8220;epigenetic&#8221; factors that change how genes are expressed.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The possibility that our environment&#8212;what we eat, the air we breathe, and the emotions we feel&#8212;can influence the health of our descendants has tremendous implications for basic biology and for public health and policy,&#8221; Sharma said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Yet the idea of &#8220;intergenerational epigenetic inheritance&#8221; remains controversial, because the mechanism is unclear and because it contradicts the longstanding idea that acquired traits cannot be inherited. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sharma has already made important contributions to this burgeoning field, challenging prior notions about the inheritance of paternal environmental effects. As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, she led studies showing that epigenetic information related to the father's diet is transmitted to offspring via sperm. She discovered that the carriers of this epigenetic information are small RNA molecules that are produced by the cells of the epididymis, the long convoluted tubule in which sperm mature after leaving the testes, and that specialized vesicles carry the payload of small RNAs from the epididymis to sperm.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This research provided the first direct evidence of RNA-mediated communication between non-reproductive body cells (called somatic cells) and the germ cells (sperm). Previously, the transmission of information from somatic cells to germ cells (and thus to offspring) was thought to be prevented by the so-called &#8220;Weismann barrier&#8221; proposed by evolutionary biologist August Weismann.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">We now have evidence countering that long-held belief,&#8221; Sharma said. &#8220;We still have a lot to learn, though, about the mechanistic basis of this soma-to-germline communication and its consequences to offspring.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">With the new funding, Sharma will investigate four key steps of this process: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">how parental somatic cells in the epididymis generate informational signals, </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">how those signals are influenced by environment, </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">how those signals are transmitted to the sperm, and </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">how those signals influence gene expression and development in the offspring.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Her research uses a powerful combination of molecular, genetic, reproductive, and genomic approaches in mice as a mammalian model organism. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">These studies have the potential to provide crucial insights into the mechanism of intergenerational epigenetic inheritance, a phenomenon for which we have observational evidence, but still lack a molecular explanation,&#8221; Sharma said. &#8220;Understanding this phenomenon has significant implications for human health conditions such as obesity and starvation and their influence on future generations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The NIH Director&#8217;s New Innovator Award is supported by the NIH Common Fund&#8217;s High-Risk, High-Reward Research program. Sharma&#8217;s award for &#8220;Paternal contributions to offspring health: Intergenerational epigenetic inheritance via sperm small RNAs&#8221; is grant number DP2 AG066622.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Each year, I look forward to seeing the creative approaches these researchers take to solve tough problems in biomedical and behavioral research,&#8221; said NIH Director Francis Collins. &#8220;I am confident the 2019 cohort of awardees has the potential to advance our mission of enhancing health through their groundbreaking studies.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="83f4d60a8072701716291855086b59d7"><name>revisions-issued-uc-policy-on-pii</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Revisions Issued to the UC policy on the Protection of Administrative Records Containing PII</title><summary>Revisions Issued to the UC policy on the Protection of Administrative Records Containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</summary><start-date>1568666640000</start-date><display-name>Revisions Issued to the UC policy on the Protection of Administrative Records Containing PII</display-name><path>/2019/09/revisions-issued-uc-policy-on-pii</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/revisions-issued-uc-policy-on-pii</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1569876923869</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1569877321982</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div class="page" title="Page 1">

<p>"Addressing housing security is our top priority," said Brian Arao (Oakes College, '00, molecular, cellular, and developmental biology), associate dean of students and chief of staff to Dean of Students Garrett Naiman. "A plethora of programs address food insecurity, and we will scale those up, but we have had limited infrastructure to make the community rental market more secure, more stable, and more safe for students. We want students to know that if their housing becomes unstable, they can come to us for resources."</p>
<p>The UC system, like universities across the country, is recognizing the prevalence of food insecurity among students. At UCSC, 48 percent of undergraduates and 31 percent of graduate students experience food insecurity, which encompasses both insufficient food and insufficiently nutritious food, according to the latest survey of students. Systemwide, 44 percent of undergraduates and 26 percent of graduate students are food insecure.</p>
<p>"Santa Cruz is above average because of housing precarity," said Tim Galarneau (Rachel Carson College, '05, psychology and community studies), a research and education specialist at UCSC's Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) and co-chair of the Basic Needs Committee. "Tuition isn't the issue. The cost of attendance is skyrocketing because of the cost of rent."</p>
<p><strong><em>Meeting basic needs supports student academic success</em></strong></p>
<p>The Basic Needs Center is co-led by the Dean of Students Office, which provides direct student services, and CASFS and the Blum Center on Poverty, Social Enterprise, and Participatory Governance. CASFS and the Blum Center are rooted in the academic mission and bring research and educational opportunities to the mission of addressing basic needs. In addition to providing direct services to students, the Basic Needs Center oversees education and outreach efforts, and campus leaders advocate systemwide for resources.</p>
<p>"This isn't a one-time problem," said Galarneau, who has spearheaded efforts within the UC system to increase the amount of local, organic food purchased by campus dining programs and to create learning opportunities for students interested in how they can help improve the food system. "This is a permanent change on the educational landscape, and universities and colleges are having to address the basic needs of their students."</p>
<p>Blum Center Director Heather Bullock, a professor of psychology and co-chair of the Basic Needs Committee, said supporting students' housing and food-security needs is crucial&#8212;and it's central to UC's core mission of education.</p>
<p>"We know meeting students' basic needs makes a significant difference in terms of degree completion, academic success, and student well-being," she said.</p>
<p>The impact of "basic needs insecurity" on academic performance translates to a .3 drop in GPA for undergraduates; graduate students take 3-6 months longer to complete their degree, according to systemwide data.&#160;</p>
<p><strong><em>Funding housing, staff positions, and student opportunities</em></strong></p>
<p>The new state funding includes more than $350,000 that is mandated for the &#8220;rapid rehousing&#8221; of students who are homeless or at immediate risk of becoming homeless, said Arao. Funds will support a program that provides temporary housing in hotels for students facing a housing-related emergency, and the money will also shore up the campus's emergency housing supply; 12 beds at Family Student Housing were set aside last spring for students in need, said Arao.</p>
<p>"The rapid rehousing money is going to be a game changer," said Arao. &#8220;We&#8217;ve never had dedicated funds to help students facing a housing crisis. We&#8217;ve always had to patch together resources.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>The $1.5 million in state funding will also build up the corps of Basic Needs staffers on campus. It will double the number of full-time Slug Support case managers who do crisis intervention, fund a Basic Needs Coordinator in the Dean of Students Office, and support a new half-time position in the Financial Aid Office that will help direct students to resources, including scholarships linked to academic achievement.</p>
<p>In addition, a new full-time supervisor will be hired for the<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/11/basic-needs-cafe.html"> Cowell Coffee Shop for the Peoples</a> to oversee food services and an educational food truck that will begin operations after the position is filled; that search gets underway this fall, said Galarneau.</p>
<p>At CASFS, a part-time Basic Needs coordinator will oversee production on the Farm of fruits and vegetables destined for dining halls, pantries, and other campus sites, and a half-time position will support the integration of basic needs curriculum into courses. The funding will relieve the budgets of some existing campus programs that redirected resources to address urgent needs, and it will expand a part-time, CASFS-based co-coordinator position to full-time.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>For students, the funding will provide opportunities to work in the Cowell Coffee Shop, food pantries, pop-up food markets, and the Dean of Students Office. Opportunities for students to engage in research and evaluation with the Blum Center are also being supported.</p>
<p>"This ongoing support from the state builds our collective capacity to address these problems," said Arao, noting that some programs will get augmentations in subsequent years, including the food pantry run by the Student Union Assembly (SUA). "Students are doing amazing work supporting each other. SUA is a great partner."</p>
<p><strong><em>Education and outreach</em></strong></p>
<p>In addition to helping current students, the funds will support outreach to admitted students even before they arrive on campus to build awareness and literacy about resources to help them meet their basic needs. A medical emergency can quickly escalate, noted Arao.</p>
<p>"If a student has a medical copay, or suddenly needs to have their wisdom teeth out, they might not have money for food or a roof over their head," he said.</p>
<p>Arao would also like to pilot new programs, including one in financial capability to help students learn to build a budget, plan their spending, and assess appropriate levels of student debt. A food literacy program could focus on nutrition and food preparation, and housing literacy could include information about security deposits and lease agreements. Students have used their spring financial aid checks to put down a security deposit on housing for fall quarter, and then lacked money for meals and books, said Galarneau.</p>
<p>"We've been so focused on crisis response that we haven't been able to talk proactively with students," said Arao. "We want to help them become educated about what's in their sphere of influence in terms of basic needs."</p>
<p>The state support will bolster programs, bring new leadership to campus, and allow staff to focus on program delivery, but Arao, Galarneau, and Bullock agree that the need continues to exceed available resources, and they hope the campus continues to try new and creative strategies. For example, doctoral students now receive a $1,500 grant, through a systemwide program, to help them meet the cost of moving to Santa Cruz, said Galarneau.</p>
<p>On Dec. 3, UC Santa Cruz will join in Giving Tuesday&#8212;which has become an international day of charitable giving&#8212;to raise money to help students through hardships.&#160;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yulianna Ortega<span>(Merrill, '09,&#160;</span>Latin&#160;American &amp;&#160;Latino studies and biology) is a passionate advocate and mentor, working hard to bridge the diversity gap in science, engineering, and technology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her time at UC Santa Cruz, Ortega, the campus's STEM Diversity Programs director, has earned the trust and respect of fellow staff members, faculty, and students across divisions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now she is getting campuswide recognition for all of her contributions to UC Santa Cruz. After 15 years of excellent work on campus, she is being honored with this year&#8217;s Outstanding Staff Award.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Ortega&#8217;s great surprise, the good news came on her birthday. &#8220;I was elated and grateful to celebrate this milestone with those that have shaped me: my culture, my parents, my husband, my two daughters, my community, my teachers, and mentors and those that support the work I do.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ortega has a longstanding personal commitment to her work. &#8220;I believe many talented individuals are hidden in the communities that are not traditionally represented in STEM,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Over the past 15 years of serving students, I&#8217;ve witnessed students manage and excel in academics while overcoming personal hardships, structural barriers and racism."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Throughout the years I continue to stay in touch with many of these students, so I am overwhelmed with joy and humbled by their nomination,&#8221; Ortega said. &#8220;While the world might recognize them as scientists, I have the honor of knowing them as individuals. My reward comes from knowing the most amazing human beings with the most impressive talents.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentoring is an essential part of her work. &#8220;It promotes resilience," Ortega said. "It celebrates diversity, culture, and individual identities while embracing scientific discovery to solve the world&#8217;s pressing issues.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC STEM Diversity Programs encompass a variety of programs that support underrepresented students in STEM fields.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Office of STEM Diversity Programs is an umbrella office that includes programs funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, as well as state-funded and donor-supported programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ever-humble Ortega&#8212;affectionately known as &#8220;Yuli&#8221;&#8212;wants to share her recent successes and this latest honor with her staff members Xingci Situ and Daniela Bolanos and the faculty directors of the programs her department runs, along with the talented students who have gone on to represent UC Santa Cruz at universities and workplaces all over the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for making space and time, and for all your effort in recognizing staff,&#8221; Ortega said, addressing the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Alumni Association, which administers the award</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;I am committed to the values of community, diversity, and inclusion at UCSC, and I am happy to work alongside all of you, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Situ was expansive about Ortega&#8217;s talent and influence in her letter of recommendation to the selection committee. She noted that Ortega has mentored over 1,000 undergraduate and graduate students since 2005, when she started out as a program assistant in the STEM Diversity Programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a first-generation college student and Latina woman in STEM, she understands the daily struggles, family pressures, and mental stress that minority students face every day,&#8221; Situ said. &#8220;Ms. Ortega is a person who deeply cares about students&#8217; academic success and their well-being. She has a unique perspective of student mentoring in which she believes in individualized mentorship. She always makes herself available to the students whenever they need to talk.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Situ also called attention to Ortega&#8217;s warm and welcoming personality, describing her as &#8220;selfless, and a giver at heart, always carrying a positive and uplifting attitude.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Astronomy and Astrophysics Professor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz praised her vision and commitment, as well as her effectiveness as a leader.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Moving an organization toward greater diversity, equity, and inclusion requires intentional, committed, and often courageous leadership,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz said. &#8220;Yuli has been able to articulate a unique vision and model the changes that are needed to create meaningful change at UCSC. Yuli is one of the most gifted mentors and has empowered hundreds of students. Her intelligence and grace set the bar high for campus leaders and students alike, and she continues to serve as one of our greatest inspirations. I am incredibly lucky to work alongside her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students who have been mentored by Ortega also praised her commitment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"As a minority student, I have always felt that she has had my back and well-being in mind,&#8221; said Stephanie Nystrom, a graduate student in the Department of Molecular, Cell &amp; Developmental Biology. &#8220;She takes everything seriously and is active in learning to keep up with everything that is going on with her students and the climate. If she does not understand our experiences, she is willing to listen and educate herself. This allows her to become an even better mentor every year for the future students that come through the program.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC Alumni Association established the Outstanding Staff Award in 1995. After 25 years, this award continues to recognize and celebrate staff who have displayed distinguished service to student life, the growth and improvement of UCSC's programs, and the preservation of UCSC's unique intellectual and physical environment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni value the hard work and dedication of UCSC staff and look forward to this opportunity to honor them with this annual award.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Jones, UCSC&#8217;s Associate Director for Black Student Success, and chair of the campus&#8217;s Staff Advisory Board, spoke of the importance of the annual staff awards, as well as the many impressive contenders in this year&#8217;s field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The 2020 nominations pool was awe-inspiring, comprising over 100 nominees, who represent a vast array of backgrounds, job titles, campus units, and years of experience,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While there were many excellent and deserving candidates this year," Jones said, "the nominations for Yulianna Ortega spoke to her true dedication to her students, as well as staff and faculty colleagues; the positive impact her work with the STEM Diversity Program has had for the campus; and how much she has contributed to the success of the individual students she works with.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="bd9cc2af807270172739340f8fb1e110"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2019/09/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/09/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1545074426527</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1545074426527</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
