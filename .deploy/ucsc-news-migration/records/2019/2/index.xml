</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Melissa Harris-Perry, the Maya Angelou Presidential Chair at Wake Forest University, will be this year&#8217;s featured speaker at the annual UC Santa Cruz Martin Luther King Jr. Convocation in downtown Santa Cruz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The free convocation takes place at 7 p.m., Monday, February 11, at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium in Santa Cruz. This annual celebration of King&#8217;s life and legacy has become a proud tradition in Santa Cruz, with a stunning lineup of speakers over the years, including activist and UC Santa Cruz professor emerita Angela Davis, poet Nikki Giovanni, Harvard professor and author Cornel West, and Black Lives Matter cofounder Alicia Garza. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris-Perry is the founding director of the Anna Julia Cooper Center at Wake Forest University and codirector of Wake the Vote. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is editor-at-large of&#160;</span><a href="https://www.elle.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elle.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;and a contributing editor at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;From 2012&#8211;2016 she hosted the television show &#8220;Melissa Harris-Perry&#8221; on weekend mornings on MSNBC and was awarded the Hillman Prize for broadcast journalism. She continues to create and direct programs with the goal of creating diverse American media. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her talk, she will discuss how Martin Luther King Jr. employed a diverse toolbox of strategies in pursuit of social justice. Today's students, faculty, staff, and campus communities continue to use &#160;many of his original tools while adding innovative new approaches of their own. Her lecture will explore definitions of social justice and some of King's approaches, and discuss how campuses and communities can create more just processes and equitable outcomes with their own toolbox.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the convocation, audience members will also get to meet this year&#8217;s recipient of the </span><a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/mlk/tony-hill-award-nomination.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony Hill Award,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recognizing an outstanding individual who seeks solutions to economic and social issues that face our local community, developing innovative approaches and building bridges among diverse populations.

cities across the U.S.  </article-subhead><article-text><p><strong>Question Bridge: Black Males&#160;</strong>is an exhibition in which a wide array of videos have been merged together to simulate face-to-face conversations between a diverse group of more than 160 black men across the United States. &#160;&#160;</p>
<p>These men answer each other&#8217;s questions about life in America and share their personal stories, beliefs, and values in discussions covering such themes as family, community, love, interracial relationships, education, and wisdom.</p>
<p>The idea is not just to create connection and understanding among black men, but also to illustrate the diversity of thought, character and identity in the black male population that is not often portrayed in American media.</p>
<p>Named as one of the Bay Area&#8217;s top exhibitions of the year by the&#160;<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> when it was originally launched in 2012<em>,</em> <em>Question Bridge: Black Males&#160;</em>has now been exhibited at nearly 40 institutions, including the Brooklyn Museum; Oakland Museum of California; Birmingham Museum of Art; California African American Museum; DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago; Harvey B. Gantt Center for African-American Arts+Culture, Charlotte, NC; Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York; and the Sundance Film Festival.</p>
<p><em>Question Bridge: Black Males</em> will run at the <a href="http://art.ucsc.edu/sesnon"><strong><em>Mary Porter</em></strong> <strong><em>Sesnon Gallery</em></strong></a> on the UC Santa Cruz campus from February 6 through April 6.</p>
<p>Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a riveting five-screen multimedia installation with compelling conversations about what it means to be a black male in America,&#8221; noted Shelby Graham, director of the Sesnon Gallery, who is presenting the exhibition in collaboration with UCSC&#8217;s <a href="http://ias.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>Institute of the Arts and Sciences</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all &#8216;world consumers of black culture' as stated by scholar,&#160;Bryant Keith Alexander, and this project offers multiple perspectives relevant to our students and communities,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Graham said that the format of&#160;<em>Question Bridge: Black Males</em>--as a video installation and website--allows a stress-free, safe place for difficult conversations to emerge and be shared in a public setting.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goal is to make every UCSC student aware of this project and through word of mouth endorsement, encourage all to visit the Sesnon Gallery,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have weekly student-led events and discussions with refreshments."</p>
<p><em>Question Bridge: Black Males</em> was created by artists Chris Johnson, Hank Willis Thomas, Bayet&#233; Ross Smith, and Kamal Sinclair. Their video work is in the collections of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Oakland Museum of California.</p>
<p>Johnson originated the Question Bridge concept with a 1996 video installation he created for the Museum of Photographic Arts and the Malcolm X library in San Diego, California. He will speak at 6 p.m. on February 6, at the opening reception of<strong>&#160;</strong>the exhibition at the Sesnon Gallery, which takes place from 5 to 7 p.m.</p>
<p><a href="http://art.ucsc.edu/sesnon"><strong>Sesnon </strong><strong>Gallery</strong></a> regular hours are Tuesday through Saturday from noon to 5 p.m. (and Wednesdays until 8 p.m.) during the academic year, or by appointment for special tours.</p>

The catalyst is a nanostructured composite material composed of carbon nanowires with ruthenium atoms bonded to nitrogen and carbon to form active sites within the carbon matrix.</p>
<p>The electrochemical splitting of water to produce hydrogen is a crucial step in the development of hydrogen as a clean, environmentally friendly fuel. Much of the effort to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of this process has focused on finding alternatives to expensive platinum-based catalysts.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, researchers led by Shaowei Chen, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, have been investigating catalysts made by incorporating ruthenium and nitrogen into carbon-based nanocomposite materials. Their new findings, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08419-3">published February 7 in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>, not only demonstrate the impressive performance of their ruthenium-based catalyst but also provide insights into the mechanisms involved, which may lead to further improvements.</p>
<p>"This is a clear demonstration that ruthenium can have remarkable activity in catalyzing the production of hydrogen from water," Chen said. "We also characterized the material on the atomic scale, which helped us understand the mechanisms, and we can use these results for the rational design and engineering of ruthenium-based catalysts."</p>
<p>Electron microscopy and elemental mapping analysis of the material showed ruthenium nanoparticles as well as individual ruthenium atoms within the carbon matrix. Surprisingly, the researchers found that the main sites of catalytic activity were single ruthenium atoms rather than ruthenium nanoparticles.</p>
<p>"That was a breakthrough, because many studies have attributed the catalytic activity to ruthenium nanoparticles. We found that single atoms are the dominant active sites, although both nanoparticles and single atoms contribute to the activity," said first author Bingzhang Lu, a graduate student in Chen's lab at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Lu worked with coauthor Yuan Ping, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, to do theoretical calculations showing why ruthenium single atoms are more active catalytic centers than ruthenium nanoparticles.</p>
<p>"We did independent calculations from first principles to show how ruthenium forms bonds with carbon and nitrogen in this material and how this lowers the reaction barrier to give better catalytic activity," Ping said.</p>
<p>Chen said he has filed a patent application for the experimental preparation of ruthenium-based catalysts. He noted that, in addition to potential applications for hydrogen production as part of sustainable energy systems, alkaline water electrolysis is already widely used in the chemical industry, as is a related process called chlor-alkali electrolysis for which the ruthenium catalyst could also be used. Thus a large market already exists for cheaper, more efficient catalysts.</p>
<p>The electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen can be carried out in either acidic or alkaline conditions, and each method has advantages and disadvantages. Platinum catalysts are much more effective in acidic media than they are in alkaline media. The ruthenium-based catalysts perform almost as well as platinum in acidic media, while outperforming platinum in alkaline media, Chen said.</p>
<p>In future work, the researchers will seek to maximize the number of active sites in the material. They may also investigate the use of other metals in the same nanocomposite platform, he said.</p>

Results from this research could ultimately lead to the acceleration of clinical genomic analysis and precision medicine diagnoses at scale.</p>
<p>"Baskin Engineering is pleased to partner with Western Digital on this important project," said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. "This initiative supports the campus's greater goals of building a vibrant, entrepreneurial culture that promotes the adoption of UC Santa Cruz inventions while delivering social and economic benefits to our local and global communities."</p>
<p>Currently, identification and treatment of cancers using genomic diagnostics is slowed by the time-consuming process of moving massive amounts of data to the computing resources. Researchers believe that moving computational capabilities closer to data storage will help speed the process of identification and treatment. Western Digital is researching a novel computational storage architecture to test this theory at scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our new architecture will distribute computation within a single computer system across multiple computational storage devices, each with its own storage and its own customizable computing resources,&#8221; said Robin O&#8217;Neill, head of emerging systems and software at Western Digital. &#8220;By moving the compute to the data, rather than the data to the compute, we expect to take advantage of significantly greater bandwidth access to the genomics data by the near-media compute, as well as the custom, parallel computing capabilities within each computational storage device.&#8221;</p>
<p>To take best advantage of this new computing architecture, the collaborating organizations are researching the optimal partitioning and placement of genomics data across the computational storage devices. They are also researching how to accelerate core functions within each device to accelerate performance and minimize host system requirements. This may also be an overall reduction in power consumption which translates to lower overall total cost of ownership.</p>
<p>&#8220;Genomic data is on a trajectory to grow faster than almost every other type of data in the world,&#8221; said Benedict Paten, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the Computational Genomics Lab at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Moving the compute to the data is a key strategy already being adopted at the software layer in several global genomics initiatives. With the support and close collaboration of Western Digital&#8217;s team, we&#8217;ll be able to take this all way down to the hardware layer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heiner Litz, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at UC Santa Cruz, noted the interdisciplinary nature of the collaboration. &#8220;The structure of this project is a first for the UCSC Baskin School of Engineering, with the close collaboration of engineers at Western Digital at the hardware layer, researchers in computer engineering at the firmware and architecture layer, paired with researchers in genomics at the application layer,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Western Digital will supply funding to support the collaborative team of graduate students and investigators in genomics and computer engineering as well as an Ultrastar Data60 platform to be used by the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute to store data for this project.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ba7d24e0807270171e737f60a26dd1f5"><name>naloxon-police</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus officers now carrying naloxone</title><summary>All sworn members of the department underwent training in early January to administer naloxone. </summary><start-date>1549267200000</start-date><display-name>Opioids</display-name><path>/2019/02/naloxon-police</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/02/naloxon-police</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1549316989324</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1549316989324</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz police officers are now carrying naloxone, a medication that counters the effects of opioid overdose.</p>

<p>Those qualities were on display as Yellen held forth in a free-ranging conversation about wealth inequality, gender disparity, climate change, and&#8212;yes&#8212;monetary policy during a celebration that culminated with her receiving the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal.</p>
<p>"To my mind, Santa Cruz represents an ideal of what a university should be, a place where students come first and are supported to reach their highest goals for themselves and society," Yellen said as she accepted the medal before an audience of 250 at the Hotel Nia in Menlo Park.</p>
<p>Yellen extolled the school's commitment to creating a place "where students are safe to dream, and to find opportunities for transformative learning. A place where students can belong to a community that nurtures and values them as individuals, and enables them to achieve their highest aspirations. Even in modern and demanding times, UC Santa Cruz preserves and lives by these traditions."</p>
<p>Yellen joins a distinguished group of brilliant, creative individuals who have been recognized with the <a href="https://foundation.ucsc.edu/awards/foundation-medal.html">Foundation Medal</a>, the campus's highest honor, which was first presented in 2003. The medal "recognizes individuals of exceptionally distinguished achievement whose work and contribution to society illustrate the ideals and vision of UC Santa Cruz." Recipients include novelist Toni Morrison, architect Frank Gehry, chef Alice Waters, and astronomer Martin Rees. The medal itself is an impressive creation by artist Sean Monaghan (Kresge '83, art) that features a base of limestone excavated from campus quarries, and an engraved bronze collar cast in our campus foundry that surrounds a rotating glass lens that is laminated, ground, and polished in the campus's optical labs of UCO/Lick Observatory&#8212;the same shop that manufactures precision lenses for astronomical instruments around the world.</p>
<p><strong>"The most powerful woman in the country"<br/></strong></p>
<p>In his opening remarks, Chancellor George Blumenthal said he's heard Yellen referred to not only as the former chair of the Federal Reserve Board but also as a "feminist icon" and "the most powerful woman in the country."</p>
<p>Before UC President Janet Napolitano introduced Yellen, she acknowledged Blumenthal's 47-year career at UC Santa Cruz, including 13 years as chancellor. "In the history of this great university, that longevity and dedication truly stand out," she said of Blumenthal, who has announced his intention to retire in June.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTYW3bMXpYk">program featured Yellen in conversation with Carl Walsh</a><a href="ttps://youtu.be/uTYW3bMXpYk"></a>, a distinguished professor of economics at UC Santa Cruz and a leading expert in central banking and monetary policy.</p>
<p>Yellen, a professor emerita of economics at UC Berkeley and a distinguished fellow of the Brookings Institution, became the first woman to lead the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2014, after serving as vice chair of the Board of Governors from 2010-2014. She served as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco from 2004-2010. In 2020, she will become president of the American Economics Association&#8212;only the third woman to lead the organization since it was established in 1886.</p>
<p><strong>Gender, wealth inequality, and climate change</strong></p>
<p>Responding to a question from Walsh about the "gender diversity problem" in economics, Yellen said it should be a top priority. "It starts at the undergraduate level," she said, noting that only about one-third of econ majors are women. In contrast to other scientific fields, she said, "We have seen no progress at all for women."</p>
<p>Yellen, who took the helm of the Fed in 2014 as the economy was still recovering from the Great Recession, spoke often about unemployment and the central role work plays in creating economic wellbeing. Her parents survived the "horrors of mass joblessness" that was part of the Great Depression, and her interest in economic policy was matched by a desire to serve in government. Economists are needed "at the table" on a host of public policy issues, from wealth inequality to climate change, she said.</p>
<p>"Rising income inequality is probably the single most important economic issue facing the country," she said. Since the mid-1980s, a large share of the U.S. population is "just not getting ahead," said Yellen, citing structural factors such as technological change and globalization as the cause.</p>
<p>Climate change is another "urgent problem," and Yellen outlined the benefits of a carbon tax, which she said economists "tend to love." Taxing those who create greenhouse gas emissions and redistributing those new revenues on a per capita basis would benefit low-income people and could attract bipartisan support, she said, noting that using tax policy instead of regulations appeals to industry, as well.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency, interest rates, independence, and crystal-ball gazing</strong></p>
<p>Noting a cultural shift at the Fed toward more transparency and open communications, Walsh asked Yellen why that's important.</p>
<p>Fed policy affects all Americans, which makes it imperative to explain what the bank is doing, what its goals are, and the progress its making, she said. It also makes the policies more effective if the public understands them, she said. "Communications is a policy tool," said Yellen. "Once upon a time, central banks were immensely secretive organizations."</p>
<p>Speaking of interest rates, Yellen said, "We're in a new environment now. The normal level of interest rates is going to be low." While the post-war short-term average was 4-4.5 percent, moving forward it will be no higher than 3 percent, she predicted.</p>
<p>The independence of the Federal Reserve Bank is important in part because the central bank can discipline fiscal authorities. Economies around the world with independent central banks perform better, said Yellen, adding that she "wasn't surprised to see tweets" at the end of 2017, when the U.S. unemployment rate was "a very low 4 percent" and still Congress approved a "huge fiscal stimulus."</p>
<p>"That's not normal in a full-employment economy," she recalled. "It's a classic conflict situation. I was sorry to see commentary coming out of the White House."</p>
<p>Yellen obliged Walsh's request to "look into her crystal ball again" to identify the potential for a slowdown. Ticking off low unemployment and low inflation rates, she nevertheless conceded that it's "conceivable" that inflation could gradually pick up over the next couple of years, prompting an interest-rate hike. But she hedged her bets, saying it is "by no means baked in the cake."</p>
<p>Global threats, including a slowdown in China and Brexit, pose the biggest risks to continued economic expansion. "The Fed will respond to the economy," she said.</p>
<p><strong>Are we safe from another financial crisis?</strong></p>
<p>Acknowledging that "hundreds of economists missed the financial crisis," Walsh asked Yellen how much her decisions were based on technical advice versus "your intuition about the economy."</p>
<p>"It really is kind of an indictment of the economics profession that nobody saw this financial crisis coming," she said.</p>
<p>Yellen said the Fed's top priority in the midst of the financial crisis was to get the economy and employment back on track, but in its aftermath, leaders realized they needed to develop a system of analysis and data collection to identify emerging threats to financial stability and to be "better positioned to stem threats to the financial system."</p>
<p>"The truth is, banks were not managing their risks well," said Yellen. "But fixing the financial system and making it safer is kind of a work in progress."</p>
<p>Dodd-Frank, the Wall Street reform legislation adopted by Congress in 2010, created a road map to regulation which means the banking system today is in much better shape than before the crisis: Banks have more capital, higher-quality capital, and more liquidity, she said. They also are subjected to "stress tests" to assess their risk of failure, which Yellen called "a totally new technique."</p>
<p>But as soon as regulators "tighten up on banks," activity shifts to other sectors, and we have "inadequate tools to deal with risk," she said. Following the Fed's "extraordinary interventions" in 2008 to bail out institutions like AIG and Bear Stearns, Congress took away those tools. In what Yellen described as a "deal," the Fed got a new tool to address the failure of non-banks, but it has yet to be tested.</p>
<p>"I think the Fed now lacks the power it would need to intervene in a crisis, and that concerns me," she said, before summarizing her answer this way: "Glass half full: Lot of progress in a lot of important dimensions. Glass still half empty."</p>
<p>She is heartened, however, that economists are trying to understand "systemic risk" theoretically&#8212;and doing empirical work to find ways to identify it.</p>
<p><strong>A diverse audience</strong></p>
<p>"That conversation was fantastic," said Katharyne Mitchell, dean of the Division of Social Sciences at UC Santa Cruz. "Economists provide analysis that is central to all our challenges, and very often their work shapes public policy. It was great to see economics center stage. Janet Yellen is a wonderful leader and role model."</p>
<p>Among those in attendance Saturday evening were seven AP macroeconomics students from Salinas High School and their teacher Brant Wilkinson. Earlier in the day, Yellen met with about three dozen UC Santa Cruz economics students&#8212;undergraduates, master's, and doctoral students&#8212;for a question-and-answer session.</p>
<p>The evening was presented in partnership with the Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture, with support from UC Santa Cruz Foundation Trustee Anu Luther and her husband Tom Kailath. Luther and Kailath hosted a small private dinner for Yellen, Napolitano, and special guests before the public event. Additional support was provided by the Sustainable Futures Fund, Melissa Phillips Liu, Mary E. Doyle, David E. Greenwood, and Cultivate Investments.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bf56f946807270171e737f6067ae0850"><name>keynote-orientation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus to deliver new student orientation online</title><summary>Our goal is to provide the best experience for our students and this new approach allows students to learn at their own pace. </summary><start-date>1549353600000</start-date><display-name>Online orientation</display-name><path>/2019/02/keynote-orientation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/02/keynote-orientation</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1549398373884</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1549398594124</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Rosa Plaza</name><title>Orientation Director</title><phone/><email>rplaza@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/02/images/rosa-plaza-250px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/02/images/rosa-plaza-250px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rosa-plaza-250px.jpg</name><display-name>rosa-plaza-250px.jpg</display-name><file-size>63499</file-size><width>250</width><height>150</height></image><image-alt>Rosa Plaza</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Exciting changes are coming soon to campus orientation. Starting this summer, most orientation services for students and families will be provided primarily online, a change we&#8217;ve made with much thought and consideration.</p>
<p>I wanted to share this exciting announcement with the campus community to give you all time to re-envision how we provide information and resources to new students and family members.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide the best experience for our students and this new approach allows students to learn at their own pace, allows us the opportunity to deliver information in a similar manner to all students, as well as deliver it in a more intentionally phased plan that can be reviewed as needed.</p>
<p>Slug Orientation will assist students in preparing for class enrollment (with advising and enrollment support), navigating the campus, learning about campus resources such as Learning Support Services, safety resources, the Cowell Student Health Center, financial aid, the resource centers, college and university housing, student groups, career services, and create opportunities for students to connect with Orientation Leaders- each new student will be assigned to an Orientation Leader who will provide support when and how students need it.</p>
<p>Slug Orientation will be a required academic program offered through our learning management system, Canvas. The program is designed to assure our students start strong from the first day. Slug Orientation consists of completing a series of online courses (during June, July, and August) and full participation in our fall Welcome Week.</p>
<p>These changes are the result of reflecting on the orientation program for the last several years and reviewing other national models of delivering the services. Our previous approach&#8212;an intense full day of information&#8212;meant that valuable information was sometimes forgotten by the time our students arrived on campus. Additionally, for some families, traveling to Santa Cruz can be a burden. Over the past two years, our Berkeley and Davis campuses have made similar changes, and their experiences have been valuable in forming our UC Santa Cruz approach.</p>
<p>I have been convening a group of advisers to to create the general advising preparation plan, and I am also meeting with other groups to continue the overall plan development. I know this is a major change for the campus, and it is also a tremendous opportunity for us to really create some amazing resources that new students and family members will benefit from during summer and throughout the first year.</p>
<p>I encourage all of you to become involved in the process, please <a href="mailto:rplaza@ucsc.edu">email me</a>, if you would like to setup a time to discuss opportunities for collaboration. I am very excited to move forward and collaborate with you as this new interactive summer model is developed.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c3b2957c807270171e737f604ff75f77"><name>floral-scent</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Diverse scents of woodland star wildflowers driven by coevolution with pollinators </title><summary>Scientists found a surprising diversity of floral scent compounds produced by different species of woodland stars and even by populations of the same species in different locations.</summary><keywords>John Thompson</keywords><start-date>1549915200000</start-date><display-name>Diverse scents of woodland star wildflowers driven by coevolution with pollinators </display-name><path>/2019/02/floral-scent</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/02/floral-scent</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1549471486519</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1552262600595</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/02/images/magne-friberg-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/02/images/magne-friberg-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>magne-friberg-400.jpg</name><display-name>magne-friberg-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>114357</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>Magne Friberg</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/02/images/magne-friberg-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/02/images/magne-friberg-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>magne-friberg-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>magne-friberg-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21589</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Magne Friberg</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Magne Friberg, now at Lund University, studying woodland star wildflowers in the field.

Every species of woodland star, and even different populations within a species, may produce a unique floral bouquet, sometimes composed of dozens of scent compounds, to attract specialized insect pollinators.</p>
<p>Twelve species and subspecies of woodland star <em>(Lithophragma)</em> occur in a wide range of habitats throughout western North America. They have coevolved with a group of specialized moths, called <em>Greya</em> moths, that pollinate and lay eggs only in woodland star flowers. Although the plants lose some of their developing seeds to the moth larvae, the benefits the plants receive from pollination usually outweigh the costs.</p>
<p>The floral scent study, published February 11 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em>, adds a surprising new layer to the complex relationship between woodland stars and their pollinators. Senior author John Thompson, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, has been studying the coevolution of these species for several decades. The new study builds on previous work showing that the interactions of woodland star with <em>Greya</em> moths have widely varying outcomes in different ecosystems depending on which pollinators are present.</p>
<p>"We had already shown in previous studies that the moths can find their local host plants using only the floral bouquets produced by the local <em>Lithophragma</em> plants. So we knew that floral scent was important to the plants and the moths," Thompson said.</p>
<p>He and his collaborators set out to characterize the floral scents produced by each <em>Lithophragma</em> species in a wide range of ecosystems and see just how different they are. The researchers sampled almost a hundred populations of woodland stars in ecosystems from southern California to Washington. Although they expected to find at least some differences in the floral bouquets, the results were surprising.</p>
<p>The first surprise was that the floral bouquets include an unexpectedly large number compounds. Many populations the researchers sampled had scents composed of more than 20 compounds, and some populations emitted almost 50 different kinds of scent molecules. A second surprise was that the compounds in these bouquets arise from a wide range of biosynthetic pathways, rather than one or a few pathways.</p>
<p>"These flowers are making a lot of scent compounds, both in number and in the diversity of biochemical pathways, and natural selection has mixed and matched the biochemistry of floral bouquets in very different ways among different populations," Thompson said.</p>
<p>One local population may have a bouquet dominated by a variety of terpenes supplemented with a few other kinds of compounds. A population in another ecosystem may have a bouquet dominated by nitrogenous compounds, and yet others by aromatic esters or ethers. Why populations should differ so greatly in the biochemistry of their bouquets is not yet clear, but part of the answer may be in the ways that plant chemistry evolves with other traits as natural selection molds local adaptation of these plants to their pollinating moths.</p>
<p>There are two different <em>Greya</em> moth species, and they select for different floral morphologies because of differences in how they pollinate the flowers. So a population's flower shape often depends on which moth species is present. Furthermore, the researchers have found that different scent compounds are produced by different parts of the flower, so changes in floral morphology may affect scent production.</p>
<p>In addition to the <em>Greya</em> moths, other insects that are less specialized may also pollinate woodland star flowers in some ecosystems. In those sites, the presence of other pollinators disrupts the tight coevolution between flowers and moths, and <em>Lithophragma</em> may even evolve to exclude <em>Greya</em> moths (by aborting flowers in which the moths have laid eggs) to avoid paying the cost of losing seeds to moth larvae.</p>
<p>"There are several components to this interaction," Thompson explained. "What creates a geographic mosaic of populations with different traits is the tight coevolution between flowers and moths in some environments, which gets swamped in other environments by the presence of different pollinators."</p>
<p>The background of competing scents in different ecosystems may also influence floral scents. "The plants need to attract their pollinators in the presence of a huge array of other chemicals in that environment, so they come up with a unique signal," Thompson said. "Also, we don't have the insect side of this yet. These plants make a lot of scent compounds, but which ones can the moths detect?"</p>
<p>These studies are part of a long-term effort to understand how the process of coevolution works in nature and how it shapes and reshapes the adaptation of species over broad geographic scales.</p>
<p>"As we've learned more about coevolution, one of the things we've come to realize is just how complex the traits are that coevolve among species," Thompson said. "These are the kinds of studies we need if we are to make scientifically informed plans for conserving the Earth&#8217;s many highly coevolved interactions at a time when environments are changing quickly. These results tell us that species coevolve as a geographic mosaic in which each local interaction between species may include unique evolutionary solutions. If we are to conserve species in a world in which environments are changing rapidly, we need to conserve as many of these links as possible."</p>
<p>Work on this collaborative study began eight years ago, when first author Magne Friberg was a postdoctoral associate in Thompson&#8217;s laboratory at UC Santa Cruz. Friberg, now on the faculty at Lund University in Sweden, has continued to collaborate with Thompson. UCSC graduate student Christopher Schwind helped Friberg and Thompson find plants and sample floral scents in many remote ecosystems. Coauthor Robert Raguso at Cornell University is a specialist in the evolution of floral volatiles and their interactions with pollinating moths, and he brought expertise not only on the methods needed for analysis of these complex floral bouquets but also on interpretation of the wide range of biochemical pathways used by these plants. Coauthor Paulo Guimar&#227;es, Jr. from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, who is a specialist in ecological and evolutionary network theory, brought expertise on how to interpret the complexity of these floral scents.</p>

<p>Albright recently topped the <em>New York Times </em>bestseller list with her 2018 book, <em>Fascism: A Warning</em>, in which she traces fascism&#8217;s roots, calls out the global rise of right-wing authoritarian regimes, and expresses grave concern about divisions, resentments, and isolationism in the United States.</p>
<p>During her on-stage discussion at the Kaiser Permanente Arena with Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Martha Mendoza, (Kresge '88, individual major, journalism and education) Albright drew from global as well as personal history to make the case that fascism remains a virulent threat. &#8220;The definition (of) fascist is someone who identifies with one group at the expense of another, thinks the press is the enemy of the people, believes various institutional structures don&#8217;t work, and is prepared to use violence to maintain power,&#8217;&#8217; said Albright, who served as Secretary of State from 1997 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Albright, addressing the largest crowd on her speaking tour, talked about the insidious, creeping quality of fascism, which can worm its way into a society and take over before the population has a chance to sound the alarm. At one point, Albright quoted Benito Mussolini, whom she described as the first fascist: &#8220;If you pluck a chicken one feather at a time, nobody notices.&#8221; Albright added that &#8220;there is a lot of feather-plucking going on right now.&#8221;<span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>In her book, Albright never characterizes President Donald Trump as fascist, though she has described him as &#8220;the most anti-democratic leader that I have studied in American history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even when Trump was not mentioned by name, he was a shadow looming over Albright&#8217;s discussion with Mendoza.</p>
<p>Albright, during a talk that briefly overlapped Trump&#8217;s State of the Union address, called upon audience members to become involved in local and national politics, while calling leaders out &#8220;for not respecting the judiciary,&#8217;&#8217; encouraging people to revile the press, and acting as though they are &#8220;above the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her book, she writes that &#8220;the president&#8217;s penchant for denigrating other countries has cost America an immense amount of goodwill while boosting the electoral prospects of foreign politicians who express hostility toward Washington and its policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Santa Cruz, Albright elaborated on this remark: &#8220;I think that our strength is the fact that we do have friends and allies, that we don&#8217;t have to do everything alone. &#8230;We need to know that our national interests are protected better when we are in partnership with other countries so we can share the burdens and do things together ... If you look at history, when America is absent, terrible things happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think &#8216;America first&#8217; then becomes &#8216;America alone,&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;I am troubled by the return to the sense that we can be an island. We can&#8217;t. I find it stunning that we have managed to make enemies. How can you be an enemy with Canada? What is brilliant about America is we have had two friends on both of our border frontiers.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Comic relief</strong></p>
<p>Though the conversation matter often drifted towards the somber and the tragic, Albright gracefully accepted an audience member&#8217;s question about her famous collection of brooches, which the Smithsonian Castle once exhibited under the title, &#8220;Read My Pins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Albright used the pins to show admiration and distaste for heads of state, show her priorities to ambassadors, and react to criticisms. When she said &#8220;terrible things&#8221; about Saddam Hussein for invading Kuwait, and newspapers in Baghdad called Albright &#8220;an unparalleled serpent,&#8217;&#8217; she wore a brooch shaped like a snake.<span>&#160; </span>&#8220;I would use it as a diplomatic tool,&#8217;&#8217; she explained. &#8220;When I was secretary of state, the Russians were bugging the State Department, literally. We complained to Moscow, but when I met with the Russian foreign minister, I wore a huge bug, and he knew exactly what I was talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes, Albright assumed the guise of a stand-up comic. When Mendoza called her a feminist icon, but mentioned the noticeable lack of female fascists in Albright&#8217;s book, Albright said, &#8220;There are not a lot. Frankly, it&#8217;s the men. I do believe in women being in power. I am very excited about the women who have just been elected to our Congress. I think there is a lot of hope out there in terms of what they are going to do. But you know, I am asked sometimes, &#8216;would it be better if the whole world was run by woman?&#8217; If you think so, you&#8217;ve forgotten high school.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also urged audiences to be proactive, and engage in respectful dialogue, to counter the polarization and the coarsening of political discourse in the United States.</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span>&#8220;On my to-do list is to listen to people you disagree with,&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the word &#8216;tolerance&#8217; because that means to tolerate, to put up with. It&#8217;s more important to respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do try really hard,&#8217;&#8217; Albright continued. &#8220;You should all be very glad you don&#8217;t live in Washington, D.C. because I listen to right-wing radio as I drive, and I get very excited about it. Hand gestures and things.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A former refugee, and lessons from the past </strong></p>
<p>At one point in the talk, Mendoza asked the audience &#8220;how many people are here because someone in their past had to flee a government?&#8221; Many hands went up. &#8220;Right now,&#8221; Mendoza continued, &#8220;at the Mexican border, there are thousands of people who are being used to stoke fear in the United States.&#8221; She was referring to Central Americans who have fled their home countries and seek asylum in the U.S. Turning to Albright, she said, &#8220;how does one know when fascism is rising, and it&#8217;s time to get the kids and the documents and get out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Albright responded with her own vivid story of displacement because of authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>Born Madeleine Jana<span>&#160;</span>Korbelov&#225;&#160;in Prague, she was forced to flee her home country twice &#8211; first, because of the Nazi occupation, and later because of the Communist government. She found out that the United States prided and distinguished itself by opening its arms to refugees.</p>
<p>Albright&#8217;s family stayed in England during World War II. Many years later, her father recalled the way the English had treated them. &#8220;People were very kind, but they used to say, &#8216;your country has been taken over by a terrible dictator. What can we do to help, and when are you going home?&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast, &#8220;When we came to the United States, people said, &#8216;we&#8217;re so sorry, your country has been taken over by a terrible system. What can we do to help, and when will you become a citizen?&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p>That spirit of generosity and openness was on her mind when Albright presented a man with his naturalization certificate during a ceremony on July 4, 2000. &#8220;As he walked away, I heard him say, &#8216;Can you believe it? I am a refugee and I just got my citizenship papers from the Secretary of State!&#8217; So I went up to him and said, &#8216;Can you believe that the Secretary of State is a refugee?&#8217; That is what the country is about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the Active Transportation Program, UC Santa Cruz will receive $434,000 for the design and construction costs, the second phase of campus bike safety project, and $365,000 for four years of educational outreach.</p>
<p>With the new funding and funding awarded in 2017, UC Santa Cruz will widen and reconstruct nearly all of the bike path. The upper one-way sections and the lower two-way portions of the bike path will be widened to approximately 12-feet to meet current Caltrans safety standards, or as much as possible within the current path&#8217;s alignment.</p>
<p>Between 600 and 1,000 cyclists use the path each day for commuting and recreational purposes. The campus hopes to significantly increase the number of cyclists through the safety improvements, the use of electric bikes, and the educational outreach efforts.</p>
<p>In 2017, Transportation and Parking Services was awarded an additional $700,000 in design and construction funding from the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission (SCCRTC) to fund the construction project, which is in the preliminary design and environmental review phase. Construction is slated to start in summer 2020.</p>
<p>The first phase of the bike path safety improvement project was finished in summer 2016 when the campus redesigned the bike path&#8217;s intersection with Village Road. That project was also funded through a $383,000 grant from the Active Transportation Program.</p>
<p>With the new funding, UC Santa Cruz will offer bike safety trainings throughout the academic year&#8212;including sessions on riding electric bikes&#8212;as well as more helmet and light giveaway programs. The grant will help increase safe and more frequent biking to campus as a way to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, bike crashes, and one-person car trips.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited the CTC has continued to support the reconstruction of this vital bike path that is enjoyed by both UCSC affiliates and the community at large. Expanding bike safety education efforts will allow UCSC to continue to encourage a safe cycling community in our region,&#8221; said Teresa Buika, senior transportation planner. &#8220;We are grateful for our partners in the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission and Ecology Action in their full support of this grant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ecology Action has worked collaboratively with UCSC over the last decade to increase bike safety, and this grant will greatly increase this effort and impact.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cf6c3de1807270171e737f6001fb3889"><name>rabbi-paula-marcus-tony-hill-honoree</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Spirituality, leadership, and social justice</title><summary>Rabbi Paula Marcus of Temple Beth El is the 11th recipient of the annual Tony Hill Award, a prestigious honor that is given to bridge-builders and community organizers who embody the spirit of the late social activist Tony Hill.</summary><start-date>1549666800000</start-date><display-name>paula marcus tony hill feature</display-name><path>/2019/02/rabbi-paula-marcus-tony-hill-honoree</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/02/rabbi-paula-marcus-tony-hill-honoree</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1549668203135</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1549685895835</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/rabbipaula350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/rabbipaula350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rabbipaula350.jpg</name><display-name>rabbipaula350.jpg</display-name><file-size>36123</file-size><width>246</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/rabbipaulathumb80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/rabbipaulathumb80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rabbipaulathumb80.jpg</name><display-name>rabbipaulathumb80.jpg</display-name><file-size>14702</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Photo by Shmuel Thaler</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>This yearâ€™s Tony Hill Award honoree, Paula Marcus, spiritual leader of Temple Beth El in Aptos, applies the Jewish principal of Tikkun Olam, the responsibility to repair the world, in her work and life.</article-subhead><article-text><p>For the past three decades, Paula Marcus has been a leader, an organizer, a social justice and interfaith champion.</p>
<p>She was an early and passionate advocate for affordable housing, and launched the <em>Twice Blessed&#160;</em>movement, reaching out to Jewish LGBTQ community members<strong>.&#160;</strong>She was a key organizer of a march dedicated to the memory of students killed at Parkland. This spring, she co-hosted a march protesting the Trump administration's migrant family separation policy.</p>
<p>Now, Marcus&#8217;s labors, outreach, community bridge-building and vision are getting the recognition they deserve. Marcus is the 11th recipient of the annual Tony Hill Award, a prestigious honor that is given to bridge-builders and community organizers who embody the spirit of the late social activist Tony Hill.</p>
<p>Marcus, senior rabbi of Temple Beth El in Aptos since 2016, will receive the award on Monday, February 11, during the 35<sup>th</sup>annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Convocation, celebrating the life and dream of Martin Luther King, Jr. The convocation, featuring Melissa Harris-Perry, the Maya Angelou Presidential Chair at Wake Forest University, starts at 7 p.m. at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium in downtown Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Marcus&#8217;s many community partners include Protestant, Catholic, Muslim, Buddhist and Jewish leaders who work with her through an interfaith collaboration called the Tent of Abraham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paula Marcus is very much at the center of what is good in our Santa Cruz community,&#8217;&#8217; wrote Deacon Patrick Conway of the Resurrection Catholic Community in Aptos in a letter recommending Marcus for the award. &#8220;She is gifted in drawing from ancient Jewish tradition what is truly dynamic and eternal, and unleashing its power to inspire, motivate, and transform us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marcus, who has worked with Tony Hill, said she was pleasantly shocked when Melanie Stern, Tony Hill's widow, who serves on the Tony Hill Award selection committee, called her with the news. &#8220;What made it even more inspiring and mind boggling was the fact that I was just talking about Tony Hill with someone who had never met him,&#8217;' Marcus said. <span>&#160;</span>&#8220;I think of Tony as someone who was never afraid to really tell the truth. He always did this in gracious, strong ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stern has known Marcus for years, and vividly recalls a meeting that Tony Hill and Paula Marcus attended in the '90s. "What I've always respected about her is her calm presence and her real commitment, her connection between her spiritual work and her activism," Stern said. "They were always intertwined. She has done this work not only as a rabbi but as a citizen of our community."&#160;</p>
<p>Social justice has been a driving force since her childhood. As a girl, Marcus&#8217;s role model was her community rabbi, Maurice Davis, in New York. &#8220;He taught about social justice all the time,&#8217;&#8217; she said. Marcus mentioned the Jewish Reform movement&#8217;s strong emphasis on &#8220;doing the work of the divine on earth. That has been a very key message in reform Judaism. When we read (The Book of Isaiah in the Torah), it talks about clothing the naked, freeing the captive, sheltering the homeless. That is a core message of biblical calling, a prophetic message. It is up to us to figure out how we are going to live into that. How are we going to put that into action?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marcus&#8217;s many admirers point out the various ways in which she applies the Jewish principle of <em>Tikkun Olam</em>, the responsibility to repair the world, by addressing economic and social problems.</p>
<p>Indeed, this spiritual responsibility is part of her daily practice as an advocate and activist. Marcus was a founding member of&#160;<em>Out in Our Faith</em>(OIOF), a collective of local faith-based congregations. <span>&#160;</span>OIOF has been a local and national leader in supporting religious groups that welcome LGBTQ members. She was also a leader&#160;in the creation of Erik Schapiro Knolls, which provides livable housing for farm workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;She takes action, and then encourages and inspires Temple Beth El members to take action as well,&#8221; wrote Sharon Papo, executive director of the Santa Cruz County Diversity Center, in her letter advocating for Marcus to receive the Tony Hill Award. &#8220;She has lived and advocated for the values that Tony Hill expressed during his lifetime.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gift comes with a $500 cash prize<strong>, </strong>which Marcus plans to donate to Communities Organized for Relational POWER in ACTION(COPA) an organization that works to assist families and build community connections. <span>&#160;</span></p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Susan assumed the role in August of 2016. She championed the notion of creative entrepreneurship and hired talented new faculty. Those new colleagues joined an impressive and dynamic community of artists, creators, and scholars. Our Arts Division contributes so much to the distinctive identity of UC Santa Cruz, and I have great excitement about their ongoing work and their impact on our future.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0 0;">Dean of Graduate Studies Lori Kletzer will continue to serve as interim arts dean until another interim dean is named, which is expected soon. The campus will conduct a national search for a new arts dean.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="def2f851807270171e737f60419fced5"><name>east-remote-solar-project</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>East Remote Solar Project</title><summary>Beginning March 1, the campusâ€™ long-planned solar panel installation will begin in the East Remote parking lot and is scheduled to continue through December, 2019. </summary><start-date>1549872000000</start-date><display-name>East Remote Solar Project</display-name><path>/2019/02/east-remote-solar-project</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/02/east-remote-solar-project</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1549928690944</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1549928690944</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Beginning March 1, the campus&#8217; long-planned<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/11/solar-parking-lot.html?utm_source=11-13-2018&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tuesday-newsday"> solar panel installation</a> will begin in the East Remote parking lot and is scheduled to continue through December, 2019. &#160;During construction, parking availability in the East Remote parking lot will be directly affected. Daily and Quarterly R permit sales during the Spring quarter will be closely monitored and likely reduced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slugs Go Solar&#8221; marks another step toward UCSC&#8217;s efforts to attain a sustainable carbon footprint by generating clean, reliable electricity for the campus. In an effort to minimize transportation- and parking-related impacts during this improvement project, TAPS will be working diligently to offer alternative options, especially for R permit holders. Projects of this magnitude require campus-wide collaboration and we are confident in our ability as Slugs to work together throughout the installation period, especially considering what we will all gain at the completion of the project. &#160;</p>
<p>The work will be conducted in phases, each requiring closures of various amounts of parking spaces. Throughout the Spring Quarter, we anticipate approximately upwards of one-third of the parking in East Remote will be unavailable at any given time, and throughout the Summer Quarter approximately half of East Remote will be unavailable. &#160;However, no construction will take place during Commencement and Move-In weekends in order to optimize East Remote during those events.</p>
<p>In addition, our campus will welcome hundreds of prospective students during the annual Spring Tours in April, which will further impact on-campus parking during that month.</p>
<p>Signs will be posted prior to, and during, each closure in specifically affected areas in the East Remote lot. Special &#8220;Slugs Go Solar&#8221; messaging will be posted in shuttle buses and at shuttle stops to further increase awareness. Follow TAPS on <a href="https://twitter.com/ucsc_taps?lang=en">Twitter</a> for the most up to date information on this project and any related traffic updates. &#160;Finally, the <a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/">TAPS website</a> will soon incorporate a special section where updated project status and other helpful information will be provided.</p>
To proactively mitigate potential impacts, the following measures have already been undertaken:
<ul>
<li>
<p>Approximately 200 Remote spaces were added just north of the East Remote lot, within <a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/lot-104-sep-2018.pdf">Overflow 5</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TAPS has expanded our daily parking lot surveys to identify additional parking efficiencies and availability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In anticipation of this project, TAPS reduced the available quantity of Academic and Annual R permits prior to Fall Quarter, 2018.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*** TAPS will be offering the following special options to current Annual, Academic or Quarterly R permit holders for Spring Quarter (Please note - Quarterly R permit holders who received their permit via an appeal must successfully renew their appeal before becoming eligible).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shared C Permits: &#160;Effective immediately, current R permit holders may return, for a refund, their R permits and purchase a shared C permit. &#160;Groups of 2-4 may qualify for this exchange for Spring Quarter. This offer is limited to the first 20 groups only. If interested, your group must visit the<a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/about/contact-taps.html"> TAPS Sales Office</a> together during business hours with your R permits and ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complimentary Zipcar Membership and Monthly Driving Credit: &#160;Beginning March 4, students who are current R permit holders may return, for a refund, their R permits and receive a complimentary Zipcar Membership and $25 driving credit per month during the Spring Quarter. Memberships are limited, so if you&#8217;re interested, please email <a href="mailto:taps@ucsc.edu">TAPS</a> for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...additional special options may be coming soon, so stay tuned!</p>
</li>
</ul>

The lecture, which is free and open to the public, will take place on Tuesday, February 26, at 7 p.m. in the Music Recital Hall on the UCSC campus.</p>
<p>Getoor's lecture will address the promises and challenges of data science, a field fast-becoming one of the strongest forces shaping society today and an area of expertise at the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Getoor is a data science legend. She&#8217;s given keynotes at major conferences all over the world before crowds of thousands of experts in areas as diverse as artificial intelligence, statistics, and database systems. Her lab created an open-source tool called Probabilistic Soft Logic, used for everything from energy disaggregation and hybrid recommender systems to the analysis of human trafficking.</p>
<p>&#8220;My research mixes tools from different areas,&#8221; Getoor said. &#8220;It makes use of logic and probability to model networks and takes into account context and structure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Data science aims to extrapolate useful data from the huge amounts of information created by modern society. Context, as Getoor&#8217;s work has revealed, is crucial. Most approaches to analyzing data require extracting information from one database and placing it in another (such as a spreadsheet), a process which can flatten intricate structures within the databases that might have revealed important insights.</p>
<p>Getoor heads two major data science projects at UC Santa Cruz. In 2017, the National Science Foundation awarded a $1.5 million grant to Getoor and a group of other UCSC computer scientists, statisticians, and mathematicians as part of the Transdisciplinary Research in Principles of Data Science (TRIPODS) program, an effort to develop the theoretical principles of the field. Getoor&#8217;s group looks at the challenges of incompleteness, uncertainty, and bias in large, heterogeneous sets of interconnected data.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a long time, there&#8217;s been an active informal data science group on campus,&#8221; Getoor said. &#8220;Under TRIPODS there&#8217;s fascinating work being done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Getoor also directs the D3 Data Science Research Center at UC Santa Cruz, a collaboration between academia and industry designed to develop open-source tools for collecting data, discovering patterns, and making decisions. Collaborations are also important across disciplines, particularly with respect to the ethical and social concerns.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been an explosion of interest in high stakes decision-making [involving data science],&#8221; Getoor said. &#8220;Some common examples are recidivism prediction, where there is an urgent need to address fairness and bias, as well as other tasks like loans and automated hiring decisions. Perspective is important: we need to have conversations about privacy and ethics while we develop these powerful new algorithmic tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the risks and benefits of insights developed by data science spread through society, Getoor sees a growing need for data science literacy and recognition that there are serious limits to what algorithms and artificial intelligence can achieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Algorithms aren&#8217;t a magic bullet for all society&#8217;s ills,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Doing good data science requires a collaborative and curious outlook so you&#8217;re collaborating with the people who will be using and affected by the system, and at the same time understand the powers and limitations of data science. And it&#8217;s important to communicate that at all levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Getoor said she hopes her lecture will prompt a broader conversation about data science within society.</p>

<p>The award recognizes Ramirez-Ruiz "for his key contributions to our physical understanding of transient phenomena involving compact objects."</p>
<p>"I am deeply honored to be receiving this important recognition. For me, the most gratifying aspect is that many of these research efforts have been done in close collaboration with students,&#8221; said Ramirez-Ruiz. &#8220;I believe that properly mentored students will afford one a legacy that will last well beyond that of any award."</p>
<p>A theoretical astrophysicist, Ramirez-Ruiz uses computer simulations to explore violent, transient phenomena such as collisions, mergers, and disruptions of stars&#8212;especially those involving compact objects like black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs. Over the past decade, he has developed a cutting-edge research program in this area, pushing the frontiers of this exciting field. His research addresses fundamental questions in high-energy astrophysics and provides a framework for understanding the observational data coming from new telescopes, gravitational wave detectors, and astronomical surveys.</p>
<p>HEAD also announced that UC Berkeley astronomer Dan Kasen, who did postdoctoral research with Ramirez-Ruiz as a Hubble Fellow at UC Santa Cruz, would receive the 2019 Rossi Prize.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz will give his prize lecture at the upcoming HEAD AAS meeting being held in Monterery from March 17 to 21, 2019.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e3067111807270171e737f600be8b97b"><name>severe-weather</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Santa Cruz County expecting another large storm system</title><summary>Another major winter storm is set to hit Santa Cruz County, with heavy rain and gusty winds starting late this evening and continuing through Thursday morning. </summary><start-date>1549958400000</start-date><display-name>Santa Cruz County expecting another large storm system</display-name><path>/2019/02/severe-weather</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/02/severe-weather</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1549997075926</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1549997934180</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Another major winter storm is set to hit Santa Cruz County, with heavy rain and gusty winds starting late this evening and continuing through Thursday morning.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Contrary to the dominant narrative of cultural extinction, indigenous residents of Marin County survived colonization, preserving and passing on their traditions and cultural practices, says a UC Santa Cruz anthropologist who will present his latest research during a conference in March.</p>
<p>"We hear the story of loss and termination, but the Coast Miwok and other Native people survived the Mission period," says archaeologist Tsim Schneider, an assistant professor of anthropology who has spent years recovering and analyzing artifacts from sites throughout Marin County. "This is a story of persistence, community, refuge, and protection away from the missions and the long, colonizing arm of the federal government."</p>
<p>Schneider will join other researchers in a discussion of their latest findings during the <a href="https://scahome.org/sca-annual-meeting/2019-annual-meeting/">annual meeting</a> of the <a href="https://scahome.org/">Society for California Archaeology</a>, which takes place March 7-10 in Sacramento.</p>
<p><strong>Overlooked history of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo in Marin County</strong></p>
<p>Most fourth-graders in California are required to study the Mission era that began in 1769 and ended in the 1830s, building models of the Catholic churches that still dot the landscape from San Diego to Sonoma. However, few residents of the San Francisco Bay Area know the tumultuous history of the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo people.</p>
<p>Much of what is now Marin County, including Point Reyes and Tomales Bay, was home to multiple small-scale indigenous communities with distinct histories and identities. Schneider, a member of the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria (the federally recognized and sovereign tribe of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo people), collaborates with Lee Panich, associate professor of anthropology at Santa Clara University, to explore three sites in Marin County.</p>
<p>Schneider and Panich use ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and hand excavation to explore archaeological sites where household items and other artifacts of daily and ritual life are buried. They have recovered the remains of obsidian and chert cutting tools, animal remains (shell and fish bones, bones of domestic pigs), as well as charred plant remains, all of which offer clues to the persistence of residents and the transformation of their diets and lifestyles. Evidence of stone-tool making, fishing and shellfish gathering, and ceremonies reveal a "pattern of activity taking place outside the missions" that counters the familiar story that Native peoples were entirely confined to colonial missions or, later in time, the reservations and rancherias established by the United States Government.</p>
<p><strong>Indigenous communities in the early 1800s</strong></p>
<p>There certainly was significant forced and voluntary relocation of Native residents from Marin County to San Francisco's Mission Dolores, which was established in 1776, but the mission was not walled off: Written accounts attest to life beyond the mission grounds and the persistence of assorted life-affirming practices for Native peoples, including hunting and gathering, mortuary rites, child birth, night dances, and other indigenous practices, said Schneider.</p>
<p>"Native people were still engaging with their world," he said. "They were staying mobile and connected to their landscapes."</p>
<p>Schneider sees the continuation of these practices during the mission era as the foundation for the enduring resilience of Coast Miwok communities that followed. For instance, Schneider and Panich are analyzing remains from a mid-1800s community at Toms Point on Tomales Bay. On that site, 3,000-year-old Coast Miwok villages became a thriving trading post in the mid-19th century after a Boston sailor named George Thomas Wood jumped ship.</p>
<p>Schneider is also examining artifacts associated with an 1852 shipwreck that took place near the trading post site. He is documenting and analyzing obsidian projectile points, nails, grinding stones for seeds and nuts, dishware, bottle glass, rolled copper beads, and iron spikes.</p>
<p>"We see evidence that they applied traditional skills to imported materials," said Schneider.</p>
<p>"We can use archaeology to show motion, dynamism, and engagement with the landscape," he said, adding that Native residents were "relatively untouched" until the early 1800s, when Franciscan missionaries responded to the establishment of Fort Ross, a mercantile colony of the Russian-American Company, by constructing Mission San Rafael on Coast Miwok land.</p>
<p><strong>Toms Point</strong></p>
<p>By the 1840s, the trading post at Toms Point was thriving, with Native labor powering the hide and tallow business. Founder George Wood married a Coast Miwok woman from Tomales Bay; the story of intermarriage among Coast Miwok and Europeans in the region becomes personal for Schneider, who traces his ancestry to a similar relationship formed in 1840s Bodega Bay.</p>
<p>Today, Toms Point is privately owned. Schneider conducts his archaeological work in consultation with the land owner and Graton Rancheria. The Graton Rancheria, a patch of marginal land west of Petaluma, was designated tribal land by the federal government in 1920; it was terminated by Congress in 1958, and restored in 2000 by President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Schneider collaborates closely with Graton Rancheria's Sacred Sites Protection Committee and its tribal historic preservation office. In 2016, he led a group of advanced undergraduates and graduate students from UC Santa Cruz on a four-week field expedition that focused on three sites: the trading post and two additional sites with dates of occupation extending to at least 4,000 years ago.</p>
<p>This detailed work follows a survey conducted by UC Berkeley anthropologists in the early 1900s&#8212;a time Schneider refers to as a "darker era" when archaeologists mapping sites around the San Francisco Bay regularly excavated Native American graves with no consultation or regard for tribal customs.</p>
<p>Schneider has also led field trips and workshops with members of the Coast Miwok tribal community&#8212;children, as well as adults and elders&#8212;many of whom now live in the Central Valley and beyond. "Because of great distances and the high price of living in coastal California, not many tribal members get to visit the places where their ancestors were living and working," he said. "It's been 150 years since the Coast Miwok people were on Toms Point, but they were here for 13 millennia and counting. It's important to respect the tribe and the cultural trauma they experienced by the long arm of colonialism."</p>
<p>Schneider is gratified to see evidence of "the capacity of Native people to make the best of awful conditions, using their traditions in ways to help them thrive."</p>

<p>He will speak on the topic: <em>The Right to Be Heard&#8211;Jews, Human Rights, and Global Democracy</em>.</p>
<p>Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Loeffler is a professor of history and Jewish studies at the University of Virginia, and a former Robert A. Savitt Fellow at the Mandel Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</p>
<p>In his talk, Loeffler will draw from his new book,&#160;<em>Rooted Cosmopolitans: Jews and Human Rights in the Twentieth Century </em>(Yale University Press, 2018), to discuss the 1948 moment in which modern human rights was born.</p>
<p>2018 marked the 70th anniversary of two momentous events in history--the creation of the United Nations&#8217;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the birth of the State of Israel--which both took place during a time of crisis for global democracy.</p>
<p>Today those events are still entwined, with ongoing debates about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, global antisemitism, and American foreign policy.</p>
<p>Loeffler will revisit the history of the modern Human Rights movement and examine the relationship between the Holocaust, the legal framework of Human Rights, and the struggle to find justice on a global scale.</p>
<p>His lecture will also address the challenges and opportunities for minorities and stateless peoples by focusing on Jewish human rights pioneers who saw the Jewish state as an expression of global democracy.</p>
<p>At the University of Virginia, Loeffler teaches courses in Jewish and European history, Russian and East European history, international legal history, and the history of human rights.</p>
<p>His first book,&#160;<em>The Most Musical Nation: Jews and Culture in the&#160;Late Russian Empire</em>, won eight major awards and honors, including from the Association for Jewish Studies, the Sami Rohr Prize, and the ASCAP foundation.</p>
<p>His other writings include essays on East European Jewish history, the antisemitism of Richard Wagner and Frederic Chopin, the history of klezmer music, American Jewish politics, the origins of Israeli popular song, the memory of the Holocaust in Soviet Jewish culture, and the history of international law.</p>
<p>A trained pianist and musicologist, Loeffler has consulted for National Public Radio, the Center for Jewish History, Carnegie Hall, and numerous other cultural institutions. For 10 years, he served as scholar-in-residence for the Pro Musica Hebraica concert series at the Kennedy Center.</p>
<p>Before that, he directed the Former Soviet Jewish Community Cultural Initiative at the Center for Traditional Music and Dance in New York City and worked at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research and the Jewish Music Research Center at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>He also contributed the liner notes to the Grammy-nominated album&#160;<em>The&#160;Zemiros Project</em>&#160;(Traditional Crossroads, 2000).</p>
<p>Loeffler is currently working on<span>&#160;</span><em>The Law of Strangers,&#160;</em>an edited volume of articles&#160;about Jewish lawyers and international law. His writings on contemporary Jewish and legal affairs have also appeared in the&#160;<em>New York Times,</em>&#160;the<span>&#160;</span><em>Washington Post</em>, the&#160;<em>Wall Street Journal,&#160;Tablet</em>, and&#160;<em>Slate</em>.&#160;</p>
<p>The Helen Diller Distinguished Lect<a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/projects/hellen-diller-distinguished-lecture-jewish-studies/?_sft_project-year=current"></a>ure in Jewish Studies is presented annually at UC Santa Cruz to honor Helen Diller, whose endowment continues to provide crucial support to Jewish Studies at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>This year, the event is also being presented as part of the <strong><em>The Humanities Institute&#8217;s</em></strong> <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/initiatives/data-and-democracy/"><strong><em>Data and Democracy initiative</em></strong></a>, a project of&#160;the Expanding Humanities, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>
<p>A public reception will follow the lecture. <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=3417&amp;cid=6310"><strong>RSVP</strong></a> is requested. For more information, contact <a href="mailto:thi@ucsc.edu">thi@ucsc.edu</a> or call 831-459-1274.</p>

McCarter Graduate Student Policy Awards from the Ecological Society of America (ESA).</p>
<p>This award provides graduate students with the opportunity to receive policy and communication training in Washington, D.C., and meet with lawmakers.</p>
<p>Gonzalez is interested in the ecology of coastal kelp forests and their use as a natural resource. Her research focuses on the environmental and genetic drivers of variation in kelp morphology and production of commercially important chemicals. She is a member of the RC Lab directed by Peter Raimondi and Mark Carr, professors of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. Previously, Gonzalez conducted research in Chile as a U.S. Fulbright Student, working with local researchers and kelp harvesters to study the ecology, perspectives, and impacts associated with artisanal kelp harvesting.</p>
<p>She and the other award recipients will travel to Washington, D.C., in March to learn about the legislative process and federal science funding, to hear from ecologists working in federal agencies, and to meet with their members of Congress on Capitol Hill. This Congressional Visit Day, organized and sponsored by ESA, offers GSPA recipients the chance to interact with policymakers and discuss the importance of federal funding for science, in particular the biological and ecological sciences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scientists who are confident in their ability to communicate with decision-makers are needed more than ever to bridge the gap between science and policy,&#8221; said ESA President Laura Huenneke. &#8220;The Katherine S. McCarter Graduate Student Policy Award provides real-life, hands-on experience for early career ecologists. The society is grateful to be able to assist a number of individuals each year in advancing their effectiveness in this crucial arena.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

collaborative approach to supporting students with disabilities</article-subhead><article-text><p>This month, the UCSC <a href="https://drc.ucsc.edu">Disability Resource Center</a> (DRC) is making available an instructor handbook entitled, &#8220;<a href="https://drc.ucsc.edu/faculty-and-staff/fac-staff-overview/drcinstructorhandbook">Practices for Fostering Access, Equity, and Inclusion for Students with Disabilities</a>.&#8221; A collaborative endeavor between the <a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu">Division of Student Success</a> and the <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu">Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning</a> (CITL), the handbook was compiled in response to feedback over the past few years about the need for a comprehensive, practical guide to better support classroom instructors&#8211;including faculty, GSIs, and TAs&#8211;in serving students with disabilities at UCSC.</p>
<p>As a campus dedicated to ensuring that all students have an equal opportunity to succeed and thrive academically, UCSC has a responsibility as well as a commitment to provide full access to academic courses and programs to students with disabilities. Yet as the number of students registering for accommodations has risen, instructors have repeatedly asked for practical, hands-on advice about how best to give access to students with disabilities, as well as how to balance individual accommodations with class requirements and expectations. This handbook is an important step towards providing such practical, instructor-facing information.</p>
<p>The handbook reviews the legal basis and history of disability rights to contextualize &#8220;why&#8221; we do this work and to understand the evolving landscape of equal opportunity. It also outlines the shared responsibilities of students, instructors, and the institution in the accommodations process (i.e., the &#8220;how&#8221;). Functional explanations provide instructors a guided review of the specific expectations of the instructor role. The handbook also discusses inclusive pedagogy with a focus on <a href="https://www.aacu.org/diversitydemocracy/2014/fall/kelly">universal design</a>, an approach to course design that cuts down on the need for accommodations by &#8220;building in&#8221; inclusive elements. Universal Design techniques include <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/captions/">captioning video and web audio</a> and making sure all documents and web pages are <a href="https://www.pcc.edu/instructional-support/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2018/08/OnlineAccessibilityHandbook-loRes.pdf">accessible</a> and can be <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/electronic-accessibility/web-developers/create-accessible-pdfs.html">converted to alternative formats</a>. The handbook also includes practical strategies for promoting inclusive learning practices in the classroom. The final section of the handbook outlines pedagogical approaches to support students with specific disabilities, suggests reasonable accommodations, gives information about where to go for additional information, and shares resources so instructors can &#8220;go deeper&#8221; into topical areas to increase understanding of what it means to ensure equal access to particular populations of students with disabilities.</p>
<p>This handbook has been developed as a resource to support educators and to support the meaningful impact instructors have on students every day. It represents the results of a collaborative approach to serving students with disabilities that has emerged on the campus over the past couple of years as the DRC and CITL have worked closely to come up with better resources for faculty and other instructors. Instructors frequently report feeling inadequately prepared to discern what constitutes appropriate accommodations with relation to attendance, deadlines, examinations, and other aspects of course design and teaching practice that may need to be modified for students with disabilities. It is our sincere hope that this handbook will begin to demystify aspects of the accommodations process and help instructors understand both their rights and their responsibilities with relation to students with disabilities.</p>
<p>Both the DRC and the CITL welcome feedback regarding the handbook, and are planning a revision in summer 2019 in response to community comments on the first edition. A Google form&#160;has been set up to collect feedback.

Serious games are designed to accomplish a purpose other than pure entertainment and aim to impact measurable social goals.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz already offers two of the most highly rated game degree programs in the country: a B.S. in computer game design and M.S. in games and playable media, both in the top 20 of Princeton Review&#8217;s Top Game Design Schools.</p>
<p>There are opportunities to study serious games at other universities, but none offer the breadth and focus of the new program at UC Santa Cruz, according to Noah Wardrip-Fruin, professor of computational media. The professional degree in serious games will give students an entry into a rapidly growing industry, he said. According to some estimates, the global serious game market will exceed $10 billion within the next few years.</p>
<p>Based at UCSC's Silicon Valley Campus in Santa Clara, the serious games program builds on existing expertise at UC Santa Cruz in assistive technologies, games and playable media, digital art and new media, psychology, and other related disciplines. The campus's professional degree programs are designed to replicate and accelerate the process of learning from experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our professional programs in games and playable media and serious games are project-oriented and emulations of professional environments,&#8221; said Michael John, a teaching professor of computational media who has more than 25 years of industry experience with both serious and entertainment games. &#8220;Each quarter you might make three or four games, and they won&#8217;t all be good; actually most of them won&#8217;t be good, but the process of building lots of little interactive toys and games is how you learn, and that turns out to be a key skill in the workplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Historically, many serious games have focused on education. But Sri Kurniawan, a professor of computational media at UC Santa Cruz, is focusing her research on games to improve health and wellbeing. She sees enormous potential in serious games, particularly for populations with special needs such as people with disabilities, from low socioeconomic or educational backgrounds, and the elderly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rehabilitation for a stroke survivor, for example, can be incredibly tedious,&#8221; Kurniawan explained. &#8220;It can take years of physical and speech therapy to regain function. The appeal of these games is that they can make it more playful and fun. Speech therapy can take years, and adding instant gratification and high scores can make it much less of a chore and help with compliance and the way people feel about themselves doing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creating a game for health requires coordination between multiple stakeholders and often very different specialties. UC Santa Cruz has a long tradition of cross-disciplinary symbiosis, making it an ideal place for a serious games program. In addition to education, training, and healthcare, serious games have been applied in areas ranging from political advocacy to crowdsourcing of scientific discovery.</p>
<p>The new program will train students over five academic quarters in six key areas: game design, game technology, eliciting and integrating subject matter knowledge, designing and conducting efficacy measures, effective teamwork, and career planning. It will culminate in a capstone project. The program's location in the heart of Silicon Valley and the close relationships of faculty with industry will create ample opportunities for students.</p>
<p>Much of the credit for the early emphasis on games at UC Santa Cruz goes to Jim Whitehead, professor and chair of computational media. In 2004, he began developing a program for computer science students who wanted experience with game development. When the campus began offering a B.S. in computer game design in 2006, it was the first program of its kind in the UC system and one of the few in the country.</p>
<p>Students flocked to the program. During the past decade, UCSC alumni have helped create the latest generation of games. Whitehead said he foresees the same thing happening with serious games. Some students currently enrolled in the games and playable media program are already planning to switch to serious games.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of overlap between serious games and more entertainment platforms,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They work with the same programming languages, but there are definitely divergence points.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those divergence points provide the rationale for having two separate programs. &#8220;If you&#8217;re doing a serious game, there&#8217;s some sort of outcome expected, and it&#8217;s really important to measure whether you&#8217;re getting there or not. So there&#8217;s an important assessment component,&#8221; Whitehead said.</p>
<p>Designing games with assessment built in seems like a subtle distinction but often requires an entirely different design philosophy. Another reason for separate programs, according to Whitehead, is that the students interested in them are quite different.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re just not as into entertainment games as the other students,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re much more motivated by real-world concerns, and there&#8217;s value in collecting people like that together so they don&#8217;t feel marginalized and so they can exchange information and share their enthusiasm.&#8221;</p>
<p>The traditional gaming community can seem clannish and forbidding for outsiders to break into. Serious games, as an entirely new field, presents an opportunity for a much broader segment of the population to apply the tools created for gaming to entirely new problems.</p>
<p>Edward Melcer, assistant professor of computational media, teaches a required course on the fundamentals of serious games. &#8220;So many people see the potential of games to do something important, but shy away,&#8221; Melcer said. &#8220;People think they have to have all this technical knowledge or be a hardcore gamer to do serious games, but we don&#8217;t require that. We want people with passion, people who want to do something for their audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those were among the preliminary findings of Roxy Davis, a third-year graduate student in psychology who investigated the quality of health care for locally incarcerated individuals as part of a research project funded by the <a href="https://blumcenter.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Blum Center on Poverty, Social Enterprise, and Participatory Governance</a>.</p>
<p>Davis was one of four graduate students who discussed their research Feb. 8 during an annual event that showcases the community-engaged research of Blum Scholars.</p>
<p>Every summer, the Blum Center funds research projects that explore issues of economic justice locally, regionally, nationally, and around the globe. Graduate students like Davis partner with community organizations to ask critical questions; the work often becomes the focus of dissertations.</p>
<p>"These students are agents of social change," said Blum Center Director Heather Bullock, a professor of psychology. "Through deep engagement with the community, Blum Scholars amplify the voices of those whose experiences and perspectives are marginalized. Our community partners greatly value their scholarship, which informs the path forward as we work together for a more just world."</p>
<p><strong>Health care behind bars</strong></p>
<p>For Davis, whose findings were based on interviews with 14 formerly incarcerated individuals, key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The quality of care prisoners receive is low, typically characterized by brief, perfunctory visits, and detox care is particularly inadequate</li>
<li>Maltreatment by staff is common, and requests for care were often viewed with suspicion</li>
<li>Prisoners experience jail as a harmful environment that often exacerbates existing physical or mental health problems and gives rise to new problems, particularly among those held in solitary confinement</li>
</ul>
<p>The findings indicate serious issues that merit further investigation, said Davis, who conducted the study in partnership with Sin Barras, a local organization that advocates for alternatives to incarceration. Davis plans to continue this vein of research; she hopes to assemble a supervisory board of community members to ensure the work is led by people directly affected by these issues. Davis wants to interview more people on both sides of the system&#8212;those who have been incarcerated, as well as health care providers&#8212;and is eager to focus more specifically on women's health issues.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden worlds of resistance</strong></p>
<p>Each of the Blum Scholars is motivated by a desire to understand the mechanisms of positive social change. Christine Rosales, a sixth-year graduate student in social psychology with designated emphases in feminist studies and critical race and ethnic studies, is exploring what she calls the "hidden resistance" of Latinas&#8212;the everyday actions and attitudes that push back against social injustice. Unlike public marches, protests, and movements, these personal acts are not reflected in the literature, according to Rosales, who gathered the <em>testimonios </em>of participants in focus groups and in-depth, follow-up interviews.</p>
<p>A key avenue of Latina resistance, she found, is teaching and modeling a different way&#8212;for children and others in their community. Her respondents take pride in their roots and cultural background, and they resist dominant narratives about dark skin, disability, and the inferiority of women. Latinas create "micro-liberatory" worlds in their homes, where they educate children about resisting oppression, emphasize self-love as a tool to break intergenerational trauma, and embrace the restorative, liberating power of nature.</p>
<p>Rosales, who is sensitive to the power dynamic of being a researcher, developed a three-part process to engage deeply with 19 participants in her project. First, she hosted focus groups in local community centers, providing seven questions to seed conversation among participants about their challenges, their hopes and dreams, and the favorite moments of their day. A map-drawing activity elicited more detail about how and where the women spend their day, and what brings them joy, as well as pain. Each woman then wrote a letter to a loved one about her aspirations for social change. Rosales conducted follow-up interviews with 10 participants, and the final piece will take place in June, when she will host a gathering with participants to share her findings and brainstorm next steps.</p>
<p>Already, Rosales said, participants are feeling good about sharing their stories with other women of color, being heard, and having their actions recognized by a researcher.</p>
<p><strong>Civic engagement in mixed-status households in the Central Valley</strong></p>
<p>Two projects focused on Latinos in the Central Valley, where Sociology Professor Veronica Terriquez led the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/10/terriquez-summer.html">Central Valley Freedom Summer</a> project, a voter-registration and education effort modeled after Freedom Summer in Mississippi in 1964. As a region, the Central Valley boasts incredible agricultural production&#8212;as well as high rates of extreme poverty, unemployment, and contaminated groundwater.</p>
<p>Randy Villegas is a second-year graduate student in politics who supervised undergraduate participants in the voter drive. A native of the Central Valley, he is curious about the civic engagement of Latinx youth in rural areas that are more politically conservative. His research project focused on the civic engagement of Central Valley youth living in a mixed-status family&#8212;in which one or more member of the immediate family is undocumented.</p>
<p>These youth experience what Villegas calls a "duality of demands"&#8212; a desire to engage civically and, on the other hand, a reluctance to engage for fear of jeopardizing the safety of an undocumented family member.</p>
<p>To explore this duality, Villegas conducted 25 in-depth interviews over the summer and collected extensive field notes during a youth voter-registration project. He also collaborated with the Dolores Huerta Foundation to observe youth in action at protests, rallies, and events.</p>
<p>Villegas found that youth from mixed-status families were more civically engaged, particularly those who were active with a community-based organization. He also explored schools as sites of "resilience and resistance," and he found that engagement was highest around the issues of health care, immigration, and voting.</p>
<p>Latinx communities remain "under mobilized despite their size in population and potential in the polls," according to Villegas, who suspects the factors shaping civic engagement in the Central Valley may be generalizable to other rural, conservative parts of the country.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Feminism in the farmlands</strong></p>
<p>Roxanna Villalobos (B.A. '12, psychology and feminist studies), a second-year doctoral student in sociology who also worked with Terriquez on Central Valley Freedom Summer, is investigating how young Latinas from low-income communities in the Central Valley take political action and make social change. Her work is at the forefront of rural feminist studies, and extends it beyond the context of the Midwest and Appalachia, where most research on rural girls in the United States has taken place.</p>
<p>The Central Valley is "a place of contradictions," with rich farmland and poor farm workers, a large population of low-income immigrants from Mexico and a large white population. How, wonders Villalobos, does feminism play out for young Latinas in this context, and how do they take political action?</p>
<p>In preliminary findings based on semi-structured interviews with 20 Latina respondents ages 18-24, Villalobos found that Latinas who are involved with community-based organizations self-identify as feminist activists and engage in their communities around local issues&#8212;including, but not limited to, gender equality. Those who don't work with community organizations are less inclined to identify with feminism, and although they aspire to activism, their forms of political participation are limited. Their engagement is constrained by varied forms of work and an overwhelming amount of responsibility, as well as the vulnerability they feel around their or a family member's immigration status.</p>
<p>Community-based organizations serve as a "stepping stone," giving Latinas an outlet for activism, and participants report that women&#8212;their grandmothers, mothers, and sisters&#8212;serve as important inspirational feminist figures in their lives. Villalobos partnered with 99Rootz, a nonprofit youth rights organization in the Central Valley.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Call for submissions</strong></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark your calendars for the give-fest of the year. &#160;</span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Day, a high-octane 24-hour online festival of nonstop giving,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> returns to UC Santa Cruz on February 27. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This playful but impactful philanthropic festival breaks with traditional models of giving by encouraging &#8220;micro-donations&#8221;&#8212;small but important gifts that fund worthy projects while increasing the campus&#8217;s circle of loyal donors, attracting, encouraging and retaining new generations of philanthropists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the festival set a high bar for success, with 162 projects. This year, there will be some new projects and many participants from previous years, said Jenna Hurley, associate director of annual giving for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s University Development Programs and the project manager for Giving Day. &#8220;It&#8217;s about participation more than large dollars. Obviously, we would be excited about large donations but the main takeaway is that philanthropy is accessible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donations will be accepted from 12:00 a.m. until 11:59 p.m on February 27</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Donors should keep an eye on &#8220;challenge times,&#8221; during which the project that has the most unique donors in a specified time period is awarded bonus dollars.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the hours and minutes tick by, donors keep their eyes on the clock and try to outdo one another. Giving Day is the philanthropic answer to a marathon, but with an added twist: It ends with a 100-yard dash of giving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, matching-gift challenges and time-sensitive gift challenges will add a dose of intrigue and friendly competition to this festival, which supports student, staff, and faculty initiatives. Projects range from Tangroupe&#8212;a competitive tango troupe&#8212;to women&#8217;s rugby, the Slugs Fund Investment Group, and Weigh the Weanlings, a project that aims to weigh, measure, and tag 300 weanling elephant seals at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve. Projects cover a wide range of interests and outcomes from health and well-being to diversity and inclusion, arts and humanities, athletics, and business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two years, UC Santa Cruz has hosted a workshop that advises sponsors on pitches, promotion, and target demographics. This year, the course lecturer is Howard Heevner, assistant vice chancellor for University Relations. &#8220;While students are focused on Giving Day, they are really learning how to persuade an audience to support a cause they believe in,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Day got a major publicity boost this year when the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chronicle of Philanthropy,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a journal covering nonprofits, mentioned this festival in a detailed feature story about fundraisers dealing with the &#8216;&#8216;college funding crunch.&#8221; The journal describes Giving Day as a fresh new approach to fundraising, blending crowdfunding with &#8220;excitement and urgency.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magazine also highlights an impressive Giving Day statistic: &#8220;In 2018, the 24-hour online fundraising drive netted $624,441 from 6,379 donors, almost two-thirds of whom were new supporters,&#8221; the magazine notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The burning question is: which projects will come out on top this year? Will the usual suspects win the challenges, or will new contenders knock them off the top post? Last year, Formula Slug,&#160;a student-run, nonprofit sustainable engineering organization specializing in student-designed electric race cars, won the &#8220;Slug Surprise,&#8221; &#160;adding $5,000 to their project, which raised an impressive $17,259.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The&#160;</span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/?cfpage=project&amp;project_id=19009&amp;t=1519376197"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gail Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which delves deeply into the history of the Pacific island of Okinawa, came out on top in terms of overall donations&#8212;367 of them, raising more than $21,000&#8212;making this organization one of Giving Day&#8217;s true &#8220;campaign heroes.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year&#8217;s top overall money-raiser was the Smith Society, which raised $37,000 toward a special fellowship to honor the memory of Calli Joy Morrow (College Ten '17), a Smith Collegiate Fellow who died on&#160;January 13. The annual fellowship will go toward one current Smith Collegiate Fellow who demonstrates a special interest in community service.</span></p>

<p>Titled <em>Water Makes Us Wet&#8212;an Ecosexual Adventure</em>, the film chronicles the politics and pleasure of H2O from an ecosexual perspective. It screens on February 25 as part of the Doc Fortnight Film Festival, followed by a discussion with the filmmakers and a dozen of their friends who helped work on the film.</p>
<p>Traveling around California in their E.A.R.T.H Lab mobile unit, Stephens and Sprinkle interact in the film with a diverse range of people, including performance artists, biologists, water treatment plant workers, and scholars. Questioning the complex history and politics of water, they meet with an array of water experts, activists, spiritual advisors, and just regular folks, exploring our relationship with water.</p>
<p>Along the way, Stephens and Sprinkle commune with elephant seals, consult an oracle, plunge a toilet, and contemplate the flavor bouquet of drinking water made from wastewater. They even crash San Francisco&#8217;s Pride Parade with erotic water chants.</p>
<p>The result is a quirky collage of facts, thoughts, and feelings about water&#8212;entwined with an ecosexual philosophy about the intimate and life-giving qualities of the most vital liquid on Earth.</p>
<p>As the artists note in their Director&#8217;s Statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;The experience we try to communicate with <em>Water Makes Us Wet</em> is that of possibility. While this documentary highlights environmental dangers and corporate irresponsibility, it&#8217;s also about beginnings, change, and how we can better love and nurture the creatures and ecosystems we share our lives with.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Water Makes Us Wet</em> flowed from various impulses: a deep concern for the natural world, a love of water, an appreciation for the possibilities of performance art, and our adventurous, creative partnership. The documentary is our attempt to compassionately co-align queer perspectives and environmental action.</p>
<p>It also is part of our ongoing efforts to explore and expand what can be considered erotic and sexy. We believe, as filmmakers, activists and artists, that the environmental movement is in desperate need of narratives that don&#8217;t only offer doom, gloom, and guilt, but also offer sensual pleasures and joy within environmental action.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stephens and Sprinkle&#8217;s previous film</strong>, <em>Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story, </em>was released in 2013. &#160;Documenting a trip back to Elizabeth&#8217;s hometown of Gauley Bridge in West Virginia, the 70-minute documentary is about the fight to save the region from the destruction of &#8220;mountaintop removal&#8221; coal mining, a further extension of conventional strip mining techniques.</p>
<p>Calling it &#8220;heartfelt, haunting, and downright provocative,&#8221;&#160;the<span>&#160;</span><em>Huffington Post </em>noted that <em>Goodbye Gauley Mountain</em><span>&#160;</span>was &#8220;one of the most captivating environmental documentaries of the year.&#8221;</p>

She was 92.<br/> <br/>She was born Irene Hansen, in Williams Bay, Wis., a small town that is also the location of the University of Chicago&#8217;s Yerkes Observatory. As a young woman, she worked at the observatory as a &#8220;computer,&#8221; performing calculations for the astronomers. There she met Donald Osterbrock while he was working on his Ph.D. They married in 1952.<br/> <br/>Donald&#8217;s career took the Osterbrock family to several institutions around the country before he became a full professor at the University of Wisconsin&#8211;Madison. The Osterbrock family came to UC Santa Cruz when Donald was appointed director of Lick Observatory in 1973.<br/>
<h3>Patron of astronomy</h3>
Irene played a constant role in her husband&#8217;s career, editing his work and organizing his records. Christine Bunting was director of special collections at the UC Santa Cruz Library when Irene Osterbrock was a volunteer. She noted that Osterbrock&#8217;s painstaking indexing of her husband&#8217;s papers enabled them to become part of the Online Archive of California.<br/><br/>&#8220;She was lovely person and very committed to UC Santa Cruz, the Lick archive, and her husband&#8217;s work as a historian and as an astronomer,&#8221; Bunting said.<br/> <br/>With her close friend Dorothy Schaumberg, Irene Osterbrock volunteered at McHenry Library for more than 20 years, managing astronomy archives and helping researchers locate materials. In 2011, the American Astronomical Society recognized Osterbrock&#8217;s contributions to the field, naming her a Patron of the Society. <br/> <br/>During Donald Osterbrock&#8217;s career, Irene and Donald regularly entertained fellow faculty, said daughter Carol LePage.<br/> <br/>&#8220;For conferences dad was organizing, my mom would take all the spouses for cultural and entertainment events around Santa Cruz,&#8221; LePage said.<br/> <br/>Sandra Faber, now emerita, fondly recalled dinners the Osterbrocks hosted when she was an early-career professor.<br/> <br/>&#8220;Irene was so down to Earth. She had no false airs of any kind,&#8221; Faber said. &#8220;When you&#8217;re a young professor, it means a lot to be welcomed by senior faculty.&#8221;<br/> <br/>Irene and Donald were always involved in the arts, LePage said. Their Santa Cruz home is decorated with the work of local artists. They were supporters of the Jewel Theater and the Santa Cruz Symphony, and Irene Osterbrock volunteered for various cultural organizations.<br/> <br/>&#8220;She was completely oriented toward doing good on others&#8217; behalf,&#8221; Faber said.<br/>
<h3>Osterbrock Leadership Program</h3>
After Donald Osterbrock&#8217;s death in 2007, Irene worked with Faber to establish the Donald and Irene Osterbrock Leadership Program. The program provides UC Santa Cruz astronomy graduate students with mentors and funding for projects that develop leadership skills. It continues the Osterbrocks&#8217; support for scientists at the beginning of their careers and memorializes Donald Osterbrock.<br/> <br/>&#8220;She loved him and he was a great guy,&#8221; LePage said. &#8220;He was well known during his lifetime, and I think she wanted to make sure he&#8217;s well known for a long time.&#8221;<br/> <br/>Irene Osterbrock is survived by her three children, Carol LePage, Laura Osterbrock, and Bill Osterbrock, as well as three grandchildren. A memorial service is planned April 6 at Peace United Church of Christ in Santa Cruz.<br/> <br/>If you would like to make a donation in Irene&#8217;s memory, the family suggests the Donald and Irene Osterbrock Leadership Program Endowment at UC Santa Cruz. <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=780&amp;cid=1749&amp;dids=703">Give online by following this link</a> or send a check made out to the &#8220;UC Santa Cruz Foundation&#8221; with "Osterbrock endowment&#8221; in the notes to<br/><br/> Branwyn Wagman, Sr. Director of Development<br/> PBSci Dean's Office<br/> UC Santa Cruz<br/> 1156 High Street<br/> Santa Cruz, California 95064</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0d2316e780727017244b86d91f27e778"><name>lopp-feature</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tech titan returns to campus, shares tales of survival</title><summary>Alumnus Michael Lopp is vice president of engineering at Slack, the popular team-building platform, and the author of two books and a blog about leadership. </summary><start-date>1550044800000</start-date><display-name>Alumnus in tech</display-name><path>/2019/02/lopp-feature</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/02/lopp-feature</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1550703597258</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1550706328427</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/02/images/lopp-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/02/images/lopp-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lopp-500px.jpg</name><display-name>lopp-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>119663</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Alumnus Michael Lopp speaking</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/02/images/lopp-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/02/images/lopp-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lopp-80px.jpg</name><display-name>lopp-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>10829</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alumnus Michael Lopp speaking</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Before joining Slack, Lopp worked at Pinterest as the head of engineering, Apple as a senior engineering manager, Netscape, and Borland.

<p>But he learned from that failure: Lopp re-took the course the next quarter, signed up for a bonus class on a different computer language, focused his attention, and aced them both.</p>
<p>Today, Lopp is vice president of engineering at Slack, the popular team-building platform, and the author of two books and a blog about leadership, <a href="http://randsinrepose.com"><em>Rands in Repose</em></a>. He returned to campus last month to meet with faculty and staff participants in the annual Leadership Academy, sharing a talk entitled, "New Manager Death Spiral."</p>
<p>&#8220;Management is not a promotion,&#8221; Lopp said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a brand new gig. You&#8217;re effectively starting over. It is a career restart.&#8220;</p>
<p>Lopp&#8217;s tech-industry credentials are impressive: Before joining Slack, a platform that now boasts 10 million daily active users and is used by 65 Fortune 500 companies, Lopp worked at Pinterest as the head of engineering, Apple as a senior engineering manager, Netscape, and Borland.</p>
<p>Lopp first became a manager at Netscape in the mid-90s, when his boss walked in and asked him to take care of three colleagues, suggesting Lopp hold staff meetings and set up one-on-one discussions.</p>
<p>"That was my management training right there," he said.</p>
<p>Lopp identified the top mistakes often made by new managers: refusing to hand off tasks, failing to provide a team with important context, and not demonstrating trust. His No. 1 tip for avoiding the death spiral: aggressively delegate tasks, even if they're ones you enjoy doing.</p>
<p>"Your job isn't to get things done," he said. "It's to get things done at scale."</p>
<p>Lopp described the day decades ago when, as a senior engnineering manager at Apple, he presented CEO Steve Jobs with nine proposed icons for the Apple Store app that would soon launch on iOS.</p>
<p>"These are all crap," Lopp recounted Jobs saying moments after the notoriously opinionated leader walked into the room. Three more times the team was asked to bring in nine different fleshed-out designs before satisfying Jobs, who ultimately&#8212;unwittingly&#8212;selected a design that he&#8217;d rejected during the first meeting. Years later, Lopp learned this is how Jobs approached his job.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a powerful moment&#8212;albeit in hindsight for me&#8212;to see a leader wanting to work with me to change his mind and develop an opinion,&#8221; Lopp said.</p>
<p>Lopp attributes his ability to bridge the structured and technical world of computer code and the incredibly messy world of management to his parents&#8212;an engineer father and a photographer mother.</p>

The study, led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz, was published February 19 in the <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.12954"><em>Journal of Animal Ecology</em></a>.</p>
<p>WNS is a debilitating disease that has decimated bat populations throughout North America. The disease is caused by a fungal pathogen that infects the skin of hibernating bats, often appearing as white fuzzy patches on their noses and wings. Eventually, WNS causes bats to burn through stored fat reserves, resulting in death by starvation.</p>
<p>The paper&#8217;s authors set out to learn more about why certain populations of little brown bats in the Northeastern United States are persisting while afflicted with WNS, even after initial population declines. First author Tina Cheng, now a postdoctoral researcher with Bat Conservation International (BCI), conducted the study as part of her thesis research at UC Santa Cruz, where she worked with coauthors Marm Kilpatrick and Winifred Frick, both faculty members in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Frick is also chief scientist at BCI.</p>
<p>The researchers wanted to determine if the persisting populations of bats were protected by increased fat stores in winter or if they were resistant to or escaping infection. The team collected data on disease status and fat stores from six remnant colonies of little brown bats, comparing data from 2009, when WNS first hit, to 2016, several years after these bat colonies started to show signs of stabilization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understanding how bats are able to survive WNS is important for helping us to strategically help other affected bat colonies,&#8221; said Cheng. &#8220;What&#8217;s interesting about these surviving little brown bats is that they are using a physiological mechanism of building up higher winter fat stores that helps them tolerate this disease. It shows that these bats have a great deal of resilience, and that other affected colonies may also be able to survive if we can give them a helping hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study suggests that helping bats to survive WNS may require a holistic approach. In lieu of extinguishing or reducing the fungal pathogen, people may be able to help bats improve their body condition in preparation for winter through actions such as protecting or restoring wetlands and other critical foraging habitats.</p>
<p>Little brown bats and other bat species play critical roles in our ecosystems as consumers of insects, including agricultural pests. Research on how bats respond to perturbations such as WNS informs ongoing efforts to protect these and other affected colonies.</p>

<p>The chair was established in 2016 with a gift from John "Bud" and Rebecca Colligan and matching funds from the UC Regents. The initial focus of the chair is to advance efforts to use genomic data to defeat childhood cancer.</p>
<p>Vaske cofounded the <a href="https://treehousegenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/"><span>Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative</span></a> when she was a postdoctoral researcher working with David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute. She maintained her involvement in Treehouse during a postdoctoral fellowship in clinical molecular genetics at UCSF, then returned to UC Santa Cruz in the fall of 2018 to join the faculty of the Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental (MCD) Biology.</p>
<p>The Colligan Chair will provide important support for Vaske's ongoing work with the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative, which was established to analyze genomic data of children with cancer in the context of large datasets of both pediatric and adult cancers. This comparative analysis allows researchers to identify situations where an available drug could be effective for treating a particular patient's tumor. The Treehouse team works closely with clinical oncologists at several sites, including Lucile Packard Children's Hospital and UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>"I am very grateful to the campus and to the Colligans for believing in this initiative and supporting our efforts to advance the use of genomic analysis in pediatric cancer care," Vaske said.</p>
<p>In her new lab in the MCD Biology Department at UC Santa Cruz, Vaske will be studying the genes identified in the Treehouse analyses to better understand their roles in pediatric cancer. This "wet lab" research will complement the data analysis currently performed by the Treehouse team and may yield valuable new biological insights into pediatric cancer.</p>
<p>In addition, Vaske said she hopes to begin doing the genomic analysis of tumor samples from patients, which is currently done elsewhere, in her own lab.</p>
<p>"Ultimately we would like to develop our comparative genomic analysis into a clinical test that can be widely used," she said. "That will be a long process, however, and the Colligan Chair will provide critical support for the development of a clinical program here at UC Santa Cruz."</p>
<p>Bud and Rebecca Colligan are longtime supporters of the <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a> at the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>. Bud Colligan is co-chair of the Monterey Bay Economic Partnership and the founder and CEO of South Swell Ventures. Rebecca Colligan is an artist who had a successful career in photography and now works in mixed media and oil painting.</p>
<p>Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, noted that chairs that span disciplines or even departments are rare, but UC Santa Cruz has always fostered a healthy environment for research that crosses boundaries. The Colligans, he said, "recognized that genomics spans many disciplines and decided to endow a chair that could support faculty anywhere in the sciences or engineering, so long as the person is working to further our understanding of genomics in children. UC Santa Cruz is exactly the kind of place where one should expect such a wise investment."</p>
<p>Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering, also commended the Colligans "for their commitment to advancing much needed research in pediatric genomics, with an emphasis on the underlying problem rather than on a particular academic subject or department. The Colligan Presidential Chair is authentic recognition of the path-breaking research taking place at the intersection of UC Santa Cruz's Physical and Biological Sciences, the Genomics Institute, and the Baskin School of Engineering."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/12/pediatric-chair-endowment-story.html</url><title>Stepping

exhibit curated by a fellow Slug </article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marija Nelson Bleier and Tom Franco watched as a crane lifted the colorful, 800-pound sculpture 30 feet into the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The piece, carved and painted by Franco from an eight-foot-tall clay sewer pipe, was part of an exhibit Bleier had curated in her job as visual arts coordinator for the town of Danville. There were to be three of these huge ceramic sculptures set outside the town&#8217;s 1,200-square-foot gallery space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For both UC Santa Cruz alums, that moment of flying art was a tangible example of the importance of collaboration and of community. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was an awesome moment,&#8221; said Bleier (Cowell &#8217;99, art history). &#8220;I thought, &#8216;Look at all the people it takes to get this artwork in place.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was just so cool seeing them (the sculptures) in the air,&#8221; said Franco (Porter &#8217;02, fine arts). &#8220;It really elevated what I was doing and what my group was doing. It was art to be seen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bleier, 42, has worked in the art world since her graduation from UC Santa Cruz. She had jobs at a number of galleries and even had a temporary gig helping create the displays at San Francisco International Airport. For the last five years, however, she has run the town of Danville&#8217;s community art gallery. Her exhibits&#8212;she does six a year&#8212;have ranged from paintings to photos, from the serious to the playful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One exhibit, titled &#8220;Surf&#8217;s Up,&#8221; for instance, featured surfboard art and included examples from Frank and Kevin Walsh of Santa Cruz, while another installation highlighted photos of the Vietnam War taken by the men who had fought it. &#160;All of this done on a $10,000-a-year budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sometimes I&#8217;ll be watching a movie and get an idea,&#8221; said Bleier of how the exhibits are born. &#8220;Sometimes, it&#8217;s things I&#8217;m curious about or want to learn more about. &#160;Or, I&#8217;ll see something on Instagram and think, &#8216;Oh, I love this.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is how she found Franco, a 38-year-old Oakland actor, sculptor, and mixed-media artist, who is also founder of the Firehouse Art Collective, which provides space for artists of all mediums in the Bay Area. She wanted to do a ceramics show, and his large-scale works caught her eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franco&#8212;whose brothers James and David are well-known actors and his mother, Betsy, an acclaimed author&#8212;had taken a break from the smaller works he creates out of found objects to try his hand at larger-than-life ceramic pieces. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and a group of four emerging artists he likens to a band with their collaborative creations and shared gigs, went to the Mission Clay factory in Phoenix, Arizona, he said. The factory not only manufactures big sewer pipes for municipal use but also siphons off a few of the cylinders for an artist-in-residence program that it hosts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pipes, which are carved when still wet, are perfect for public art, Franco said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a shape we live with already, that we live with very intimately. That&#8217;s what I love about found objects. You take shapes we all know and put them out of context so people can see them for what they really are.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bleier said Franco&#8217;s works are narrative and extremely approachable. &#8220;He just has this playful, fun, and inclusive energy as an artist. He also likes to do collaborative work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was while Franco was a student at UC Santa Cruz that, he said, the idea of the power of collaborative creativity was born. Not only was the magic of working together evident in the studios on campus, he said, but it was also a centerpiece in his study of dance and martial arts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Franco, he and his art mates created 12 of these big ceramic pillars, using knife and paintbrush, working with a kind of creative intensity. It was free-spirited and almost magical, according to him. Not only that, but it took teamwork&#8212;from flatbed truck drivers to crane operators&#8212;just to get the sculptures from Arizona to their spot in front of the gallery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big pieces drew people in, as art tends to do in a community, Bleier said, allowing people to step outside their everyday lives to experience something different.</span></p>

Congressman Jimmy Panetta will introduce the honoree at this evening event and benefit for the Seymour Center.</p>
<p>The Global Oceans Award is bestowed annually to an outstanding individual who has made significant contributions to, and extraordinary impact on, the understanding and conservation of our oceans. Past awardees include Gary Griggs, Leon Panetta, Kathryn Sullivan, Julie Packard, Richard Harris, and others.</p>
<p>Laird has spent nearly 40 years in service to California, most recently as the Secretary for Natural Resources. In this role he served as chief steward of California&#8217;s parks, waterways, wildlife, fisheries, and coastal environment. Laird graduated with honors from UC Santa Cruz in 1972. In 1981, he was elected to the Santa Cruz City Council, serving nine years, including two terms as mayor. He then served eight years on the Cabrillo College Board of Trustees. Laird went on to serve three terms as a state assemblymember before becoming California Secretary for Natural Resources (2011&#8211;2019). As secretary, his top priorities included climate change, water conservation, access to state parks, and ocean sustainability.</p>
<p>This benefit event supports the education programs of the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. For information and reservations, please call 831-459-3800. Reservations are $185 per person or $1,480 for a table of eight. The deadline to RSVP is March 5, 2019.</p>
<p>Overlooking the Monterey Bay, the Seymour Center is a "living classroom" featuring exhibits, aquariums, touch pools, whale skeletons, full-scale elephant seal models, the Ocean Discovery Shop, and unsurpassed ocean vistas. The aquariums and exhibits feature the everyday tools of ocean exploration and focus on research conducted by scientists locally and around the world. Interactive stations provide hands-on learning experiences, while docents lead tours and bring marine science to life. The Seymour Center is a community-supported marine science education center of the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>02-24-2019</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="179ba67280727017244b86d95d04b38d"><name>yamashita-reading-celebration</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Living Writers Series event dedicated to celebration of literature professor Karen Yamashita</title><summary>On February 28, the Living Writers Series will dedicate a special reading to a celebration of literature professor Karen Yamashita on the occasion of her retirement, beginning at 5 p.m. in the Humanities Lecture Hall.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz news, ucsc, ucsc creative writing program, ucsc humanities division, karen yamashita</keywords><start-date>1550880600000</start-date><display-name>Karen-Yamashita</display-name><path>/2019/02/yamashita-reading-celebration</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/02/yamashita-reading-celebration</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1550879269681</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1550881446691</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/02/images/karen_yamashita-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/02/images/karen_yamashita-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>karen_yamashita-400.jpg</name><display-name>karen_yamashita-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>161337</file-size><width>400</width><height>463</height></image><image-alt>Karen Tei Yamashita (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/02/images/karen_yamashita-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/02/images/karen_yamashita-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>karen_yamashita-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>karen_yamashita-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23163</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Karen Tei Yamashita (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Karen Tei Yamashita (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Each quarter, the Humanities Division&#8217;s&#160;<strong>Living Writers Series</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>brings visiting authors and poets to UC Santa Cruz, providing students with an in-depth look into the world of the working writer.</p>
<p>Founded by literature professors Micah Perks and Karen Yamashita, co-directors of the Creative Writing program, the series has been the most active venue for bringing professional poets and writers to campus since 1997.</p>
<p>On February 28, the series will dedicate a special reading to a celebration of literature professor Karen Yamashita on the occasion of her retirement, beginning at 5 p.m. in the Humanities Lecture Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chancellor will be there, and the EVC and the Dean, all to celebrate Karen,&#8221; Perks noted. &#8220;There will be five alums giving testimony, Sesshu Foster, a creative writing alum will read, and then Karen will read. It should be a joyous event, a celebration of all Karen has done at UCSC--for creative writing and for diversity on campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, for me it's a bittersweet event,&#8221; Perks added. &#8220;Karen and I were hired 21 years ago in the same year, 1997. We have been sisters in crime ever since. I have been so lucky to work with her; we all have been. She always thinks outside the box. She's surprising, funny, incredibly creative, and incredibly hardworking and fun.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Yamashita received a 2011 California Book Award in the Fiction category for her novel<span>&#160;</span><em>I Hotel</em>, and was&#160;a finalist for the National Book Award.<span>&#160;</span><em>I Hotel</em><span>&#160;</span>also won the American Book Award, the Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association Award, and the Association for Asian American Studies Book Award.</p>
<p>Known for her intensely researched works that reflect her interest in communities whose stories often go untold, Yamashita received the <em>Chancellor&#8217;s Award for Diversity</em> in 2009 and was co-holder with feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker of the UC Presidential Chair for Feminist Critical Race and Ethnic Studies.&#160;</p>
<p>Her other books include<span>&#160;</span><em>Through the Arc of the Rain Forest</em><span>&#160;</span>(1990), which received the American Book Award, and<span>&#160;</span><em>Brazil-Maru</em>, named by the<span>&#160;</span><em>Village Voice</em><span>&#160;</span>as one of the 25 best books of 1992. <em>Tropic of Orange</em><span>&#160;</span>(1997), was a finalist for the Paterson Fiction Prize, and she followed that with<span>&#160;</span><em>Circle K Cycles</em><span>&#160;</span>(2001), a book based on her research on the Brazilian community in Japan.</p>
<p>Yamashita&#8217;s most recent book, <em>Letters to Memory</em><span>&#160;</span>(2017) examines her own family&#8217;s experience in a Japanese-American internment camp during World War II through letters, stories, photographs, official documents, art, journals, and other personal records found in the family archive.</p>

<p>At 11:06 a.m. today, the UC Santa Cruz Police Department and Santa Cruz Fire Department responded to the fourth floor of Earth and Marine Sciences Building after receiving reports of a fire and smoke in the building's C wing. No injuries were reported.</p>
<p>With fire alarms sounding, police officers began evacuating all wings of the building. By 11:18 a.m., Santa Cruz firefighters reported that the fire had been extinguished and clean-up efforts could begin.</p>
<p>The fire was contained to a fourth floor lab in the C wing. However, there was extensive water damage to the third and fourth floors because of the activation of the fire sprinkler system and suppression efforts.</p>
<p>UC police and the California State Fire Marshal jointly investigated the fire and have deemed it accidental. The cleanup is being conducted under the supervision of UC Santa Cruz staff in Environmental Health and Safety, and Physical Planning, Development, and Operations.</p>
<p>We appreciate the community's quick response and patience.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Nader Oweis, Chief of Police</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="260baa2180727017244b86d9e8648aca"><name>outstanding-staff-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nominations for UC Santa Cruz's Outstanding Staff Award</title><summary>Please help us honor UC Santa Cruz's outstanding staff and make your nomination for the UC Santa Cruz Outstanding Staff Award today.</summary><start-date>1551081600000</start-date><display-name>Nominations for UC Santa Cruz's Outstanding Staff Award</display-name><path>/2019/02/outstanding-staff-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/02/outstanding-staff-award</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1551121491638</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1551121568935</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>

<p>This project&#8212;which we&#8217;re calling <a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/slugs-go-solar/index.html">&#8220;Slugs Go Solar&#8221;</a>&#8212;will also include an energy storage system. The solar array and the storage system will give us more than three million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity each year for at least two decades years, saving us a total of about $6 million on our energy bill.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://sustainabilityplan.ucsc.edu/">2017&#8211;2022 Campus Sustainability Plan</a> calls on us to develop a plan to add four megawatts of solar photovoltaic to the campus&#8212;and this two-megawatt project gets us half way there. We continue to study additional opportunities to harness the sun&#8217;s energy to support our mission of education and research.</p>
<p>Construction will begin on Friday and is scheduled to go through December 2019. The work will be done in phases, which&#8212;unfortunately and unavoidably&#8212;will temporarily reduce the number of available parking spaces at East Remote throughout the next nine months.</p>
<p>No construction will take place during commencement and move-in weekends in order to maximize parking availability East Remote during these important and large events.</p>
<p>Down the line, we will install an energy storage system that will allow us to store 1.2 megawatts of energy to reduce peak demand and shift load to times, which optimizes our ability to attain cost efficiency in energy procurement.</p>
<p>Anticipating the impacts that could be created by this project, TAPS has added about 200 parking spaces just north of the East Remote lot and reduced the number of academic and annual R permits before this academic year began. TAPS also expanded its daily parking lot surveys to look for additional parking efficiencies. You can <a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/slugs-go-solar/index.html">read more</a> about their efforts to provide additional options during construction.</p>
<p>The collaboration&#8212;which includes our Sustainability Office, Transportation and Parking Services, and Physical Planning, Development, and Operations departments&#8212;underscores the campuswide commitment to sustainability. I want to thank everyone who has helped make this project a reality.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2cd0611380727017244b86d9f2d10433"><name>borderbus-alumna-rice</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Borderbus: A community conversation about migration, art, and social justice </title><summary>Former U.S. poet laureate Juan Felipe Herrera will appear in conversation with book artist and UCSC alumna Felicia Rice on March 6, at the Museum of Art and History in downtown Santa Cruz.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz news, ucsc news, ucsc news today, immigration, juan felipe herrera, felicia rice, social justice </keywords><start-date>1551237600000</start-date><display-name>Borderbus at MAH</display-name><path>/2019/02/borderbus-alumna-rice</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/02/borderbus-alumna-rice</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1551235046861</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1551239795137</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Library</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/02/images/borderbus-banner-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/02/images/borderbus-banner-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>borderbus-banner-450.jpg</name><display-name>borderbus-banner-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>130799</file-size><width>450</width><height>253</height></image><image-alt>borderbus banner uc santa curz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/02/images/borderbus-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/02/images/borderbus-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>borderbus-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>borderbus-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21979</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>(photographÂ Â© Carlos Puma/UC Riverside)Â   </image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/02/images/juan-felipe-herrera-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/02/images/juan-felipe-herrera-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>juan-felipe-herrera-350.jpg</name><display-name>juan-felipe-herrera-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>89585</file-size><width>350</width><height>233</height></image><image-alt>Juan Felipe Herrera (photographÂ Â© Carlos Puma/UC Riverside)Â   </image-alt><image-caption>Juan Felipe Herrera, the 21st Poet Laureate of the United States (2015-17) and the first Latino to hold the position (photograph&#160;&#169;

<p>Together, they will explore the role that poetry and art can play in talking about today&#8217;s urgent issues of immigration, belonging, and home.</p>
<p>Herrera and Rice will be joined in this free community event by representatives of local groups working on social justice and immigration issues, including local filmmaker Brenda Avila-Hanna.&#160;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz literature professor Kirsten Silva Gruesz will moderate the evening&#8217;s conversation, and attendees will be given the opportunity to contribute to a collaborative piece collecting community stories.</p>
<p><strong><em>Borderbus&#160;</em>is a new book project</strong> created by Rice in collaboration with Herrera. It is a rendering of one long poem of the same name by Herrera, the 21st Poet Laureate of the United States (2015-17) and the first Latino to hold the position.&#160;</p>
<p>The poem takes place on a U.S. Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) bus, in which two women have been detained while trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. As they are being transported to a detention center, they speak in English and Spanish, whispering to avoid the attention of the guard.&#160;</p>
<p>The poem&#8217;s text is embedded in prints by Rice and interpreted in audio recordings of the poem.</p>
<p>Rice notes that <em>Borderbus</em> began out of necessity from &#8220;an urgent need to generate work that points to one of the most difficult issues of our time: the conditions experienced by refugees at our borders in the face of nationalistic extremism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a printer, my job is to confront complex issues and render my response to them in book form,&#8221; said Rice. &#8220;As an artist, my job is to do so with profound integrity. As a publisher, my job is to make these issues public. As printers have done every decade since Gutenberg, I&#8217;m here to respond to the ongoing tragedy of dehumanization and to argue for a more just society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rice (Cowell '78) received her degree from UC Santa Cruz as an independent major in Fine Art Printing. She is the sole proprietor of Moving Parts Press in Santa Cruz. Her work has been included in exhibitions and collections both nationally and internationally, from AIGA Annual Book Shows in New York and Frankfurt, to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.&#160;</p>
<p>She was recently featured in the PBS series, <a href="http://www.craftinamerica.org/visionaries/">&#8220;Craft in America: Visionaries</a>&#8221; which aired nationwide on December 21, 2018.</p>
<p>Rice noted that it is important to bring discussions about immigration to the community and invite other people--both in academia and in social justice organizations&#8212;to be part of the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a community issue,&#8221; said Rice. &#8220;Members of our Santa Cruz community are confronting these issues daily on a personal level and through aid organizations, getting the help they need. We have to be there for one another--this is why community exists."</p>
<p>&#8220;Poetry and art can bring critical issues out into the light; these art forms can build bridges between multiple factions in our communities," she added.</p>
<p>This event is co-sponsored by the University Library and The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz, Moving Parts Press, and the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History.</p>

<p>The project, funded by Schmidt Futures, involves applying modern artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to understanding and emulating the architecture of the human brain. A key part of the project is to advance the technology for growing and studying three-dimensional models of brain tissue, called cerebral organoids, in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Starting with human pluripotent stem cells, researchers can now grow cerebral organoids that are like small patches of cerebral cortex or other brain regions. Improving the technology for growing cerebral organoids will make this important research tool more powerful and more widely available, said David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and scientific director of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute at the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/"><span>Baskin School of Engineering</span></a>.</p>
<p>"We want to scale up this technology to make larger numbers of more realistic models of the human cortex," Haussler said. "It will take a huge amount of work to develop this technology, but the questions we can ask are incredibly exciting, such as: What were the genetic changes in evolution that gave us our bigger and differently-wired brains? In other words, how did we become human?"</p>
<p><strong>Genomic innovations</strong></p>
<p>Haussler's team used cerebral organoids in experiments leading to <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/genes-brain-size.html"><span>a major discovery reported last year</span></a>, in which his team identified three related genes found only in humans that play a critical role in the development of our large brains. But Haussler said the evolution of the human brain must have involved hundreds of other genetic changes.</p>
<p>One goal of the new project is to identify the full range of genomic innovations underlying the brain's evolution and to characterize the roles of those genes in brain development and function. Another goal is to develop the ability to create an electronic interface with cerebral organoids, allowing researchers to stimulate and monitor neural activity. Ultimately, the researchers hope to connect genetically modified organoids to computers to study how their neural circuits respond and adapt to stimuli.</p>
<p>UCSC research scientist Sofie Salama, whose lab led the earlier study, said the current limitations of cerebral organoids include the difficulty of controlling and monitoring how they develop over time. More advanced technology for growing and monitoring the organoids will enable researchers to perform more sophisticated experiments on a much larger scale.</p>
<p>"These are not going to be functional brains in a dish. But we can coax stem cells to make little patches of cerebral cortex that allow us to explore how the brain develops and how its neural circuitry works," Salama said. "This is extremely important for understanding neurodevelopmental diseases like schizophrenia and autism."</p>
<p>The team's collaborators at UCSF, neuroscientists Alexander Pollen and Tomasz Nowakowski, have developed strategies to use gene expression patterns and other molecular properties to identify and characterize all the different cell types present during human brain development. They were both involved in the UCSC team's discovery of human genes that affect brain size, and their labs are involved in the NIH-funded BRAIN Initiative and other large-scale consortium projects exploring human brain function.</p>
<p><strong>Biomedical technology<br/></strong></p>
<p>Mircea Teodorescu, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz, brings to the project expertise in biomedical engineering and flexible robotics. He is working with Salama's lab to develop better ways of growing cerebral organoids, using technologies such as 3D-printed scaffolding to support the developing organoid and microfluidic pumps and channels for nutrient delivery.</p>
<p>"We want to create a more realistic environment for growing cerebral organoids so they can develop much further than they do today," Teodorescu said. "We also want to develop stimulation and sensing techniques to initiate and monitor neural activity in the organoids."</p>
<p>Artificial neural networks, inspired by the neural architecture of the brain, are the basis of the highly successful machine learning algorithms used to develop speech recognition, image recognition, machine translation, and other AI applications. Haussler did influential work in the field of machine learning in the 1980s and 90s before turning his attention to bioinformatics. Now he wants to combine neuroscience and machine learning in new ways to advance the understanding of the human brain.</p>
<p>"The amazing thing about the brain is how it adapts and changes in the process of learning things. That's actual neural learning behavior, and artificial neural networks only very loosely mimic that," Haussler said. "The exciting thing about AI based on machine learning is that it's not programmed--it learns to do a task by changing the strength of artificial synapses to improve performance through billions of iterations. If we knew more about how the brain does this, we might be able to create more human-like AI."</p>
<p>By creating a system of wired cerebral organoids connected to an external AI program, the researchers hope to gain new insights into the patterns of neural activity in the developing cortex and how they change as neural circuits mature. "These insights will lead us to a better understanding of how our brains learn and adapt," Haussler said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/genes-brain-size.html</url><title>Genes found only in humans influence brain size</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="35f0dcc980727017244b86d9d217b69b"><name>negotiations-with-elsevier</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Outcome of UC negotiations with Elsevier</title><summary>While we did make progress, particularly in the past few weeks, toward defining a model for open access publishing of UC research, Elsevier was ultimately unwilling to meet UCâ€™s key goal.</summary><start-date>1551340800000</start-date><display-name>Outcome of UC negotiations with Elsevier</display-name><path>/2019/02/negotiations-with-elsevier</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/02/negotiations-with-elsevier</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1551388170608</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1551388170608</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>What&#8217;s happening</strong></p>
<p>While we did make progress, particularly in the past few weeks, toward defining a model for open access publishing of UC research, <strong>Elsevier was ultimately unwilling to meet UC&#8217;s key goal:</strong> securing universal open access to UC research, as stated in UC&#8217;s <a href="https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/committees/ucolasc/scholcommprinciples-20180425.pdf">faculty-driven principles on scholarly communication</a>, while integrating open access publishing fees and subscription fees into a single cost-controlled contract.&#160;</p>
<p>The Academic Senate today also expressed its <a href="https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/reports/academic-council-statement-elsevier-feb28.pdf">support for UC&#8217;s position</a> with regard to the Elsevier negotiations.</p>
<p>In the end, cost proved to be an insurmountable challenge. For example, Elsevier&#8217;s most recent proposal did not include any cap on the total amount UC faculty could end up paying in article publishing fees. Their model also would not have allowed us to fully subsidize article fees for authors who lack the funds themselves. To meet UC&#8217;s goal of open access publication for all UC authors, Elsevier would have charged authors over $10 million per year in addition to the libraries&#8217; current multi-million dollar subscription. The university is not willing to accept a deal that increases Elsevier&#8217;s profits at the expense of our faculty. <strong>As a result, the University of California will not be signing a new contract with Elsevier at this time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>While we do not know exactly when, Elsevier is expected to begin limiting UC&#8217;s access to new articles through its online platform, ScienceDirect, </strong>possibly very soon. This will mean some changes to how UC scholars access certain Elsevier journal articles.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>What content will &#8212; and won&#8217;t &#8212; be affected&#160;</strong></p>
<p>If you use Elsevier articles in your research, here are the most important things to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most Elsevier articles published in 2018 or earlier</strong> will still be accessible via ScienceDirect. Because UC&#8217;s prior contracts included permanent access to previously published content, you will still be able to get immediate access to the full text of most articles via Elsevier&#8217;s ScienceDirect backfiles, just as you have in the past.</li>
<li><strong>Open access articles</strong> in Elsevier journals are also unaffected. Many authors choose to pay an open access fee (called an article processing charge, or APC) when they publish, so it&#8217;s always worth checking to see if the article you&#8217;re seeking is available open access from the journal&#8217;s website or elsewhere online (<a href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/ill/alternativeaccess">click here</a> for tips on how to search for open access versions).&#160;</li>
<li><strong>Elsevier e-books and other products</strong> licensed by UC (e.g., Reaxys) are covered under separate contracts and remain available as before.&#160;</li>
<li><strong>What <u>is</u> affected</strong>: At some point, Elsevier may begin to turn off UC&#8217;s direct access to <strong>articles with a 2019 publish date</strong> and <strong>the backfiles of certain journals</strong> (<a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Elsevier-SD-UC-No-PTA-2018.12.19.xlsx"><strong>download list</strong></a>). However, open access versions of many of these articles are <a href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/ill/alternativeaccess">available</a>. You can also <a href="https://ucelinks.cdlib.org/sfx_local/cgi/core/citation-linker.cgi">submit a request</a> and the UCSC Interlibrary Loan Staff will help you get a copy of the final, published version of an article.&#160;</li>

<p>Colleagues,</p>
<p>In the past few days on social media, deeply troubling allegations that a faculty member in the Baskin School of Engineering has harassed, discriminated, and abused students on the basis of their race, ethnicity, religion, and/or gender have surfaced.</p>
<p>I want to let you all know that allegations of misconduct similar to those contained in online posts have been reported and referred to the appropriate campus offices for investigation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the online discussion has also led to a lot of speculation about who is involved. It&#8217;s important that we protect the privacy of everyone involved, and I encourage our community to reach out to <a href="https://help.ucsc.edu">appropriate people</a> on campus if they have information they believe needs to be shared.</p>
<p>I also want to be perfectly clear: harassment, bullying, racism&#8212;and other forms of abusive conduct&#8212;have no place in our school or the university. Our community is one that values our differences and recognizes the unique contributions by everyone at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>I encourage anyone who has been subject to abusive conduct to <a href="https://help.ucsc.edu">seek help</a>.</p>

While the task of reorienting our campus hiring practices to adhere to this new policy falls under the purview of Staff Human Resources (SHR), all campus units are ultimately impacted by these changes. Student employee background check practices will now be expected to align with the changes that were made effective 9/17/18 for staff. Those changes are listed below: </span></span></p>

Not knowing what the future holds, not only for them, but for their families and friends, too, has been unsettling.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">We write to let the undocumented members of our community know there is nothing ambiguous about our support for you. We are proud of your efforts, recognize your contributions to campus and to society, and will do all in our power to support you. You do not stand alone. Our campus is built on an ethos of social justice, and nothing is more just than equal access to educational attainment and employment. Our Principles of Community clearly lay out our commitment: We value diversity in all its forms. We are committed to due process. We believe deeply in equal opportunity.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">The University of California system is equally committed to the rights of all students and employees, regardless of immigration status, and it's important that we all know these rights. The passage of state Assembly Bill 21 in 2017 put several policies and procedures in place regarding immigration enforcement on public campuses.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Below, we've outlined various scenarios, and what to do in each instance.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">1.If you are advised that an immigration officer is expected to enter, will enter, or has entered the campus to execute an immigration order, notify <a href="https://eop.ucsc.edu/Who_We_Are/EOPStaff/" style="color: #00458c; margin-top: 0; text-decoration: underline;">Pablo Reguer&#237;n</a>, Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Achievement, Equity, and Innovation, as soon as possible. Contact him at 831-459-2296 (after-hours at 831-428-2839) or via email at <a href="mailto:pgr@ucsc.edu" style="color: #00458c; margin-bottom: 0; text-decoration: underline;">pgr@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0 0 8px;">Any student, faculty, or staff who has contact with an immigration officer executing a federal immigration order should refer that individual to our <a href="https://lex.ucsc.edu/who-we-are/index.html" style="color: #00458c; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; text-decoration: underline;">Campus Counsel's Office</a> for purposes of verifying the legality of any warrant, court order, or subpoena. Contact the office at 831-459-1848.</li>
<li style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 8px 0;">If you are or believe you may be subject to an immigration order or inquiry on campus, <a href="https://eop.ucsc.edu/Who_We_Are/EOPStaff/" style="color: #00458c; margin-top: 0; text-decoration: underline;">Pablo Reguer&#237;n</a> is again your best contact. Federal and state education privacy laws protect your records, as he is prohibited from disclosing your education information including immigration status to anyone, except as otherwise required by law. Contact him at 831-459-2296 (after-hours at 831-428-2839) or via email at <a href="mailto:pgr@ucsc.edu" style="color: #00458c; margin-bottom: 0; text-decoration: underline;">pgr@ucsc.edu</a>.</li>
<li style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 8px 0 0;">For more information about your legal rights in an immigration enforcement situation, consult the <a href="https://law.ucdavis.edu/ucimm/contact-us.html" style="color: #00458c; margin-top: 0; text-decoration: underline;">UC Immigrant Legal Services Center</a> or visit the <a href="https://eop.ucsc.edu/undocumented_student_services/immigration-legal-services/know_your_rights.html" style="color: #00458c; margin-bottom: 0; text-decoration: underline;">"Know Your Rights" page</a> on our Educational Opportunities Program website.</li>

</ul>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0 0;">It is important to note that federal immigration agencies can and on rare occasion do enter campuses for non-enforcement activities, which can include recruitment and normal visa processing. The procedures detailed above relate only to enforcement activities. We have no indication that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is planning to come to campus.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5a2fd05380727017244b86d98cf7d6fe"><name>interim-arts-dean</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Announcing Ted Warburton as interim arts dean</title><summary>I am delighted to announce that Edward (Ted) Warburton, a professor of dance in our theater arts department, has been named UC Santa Cruzâ€™s interim arts dean, effective immediately.</summary><start-date>1551945600000</start-date><display-name>Announcing Ted Warburton as interim arts dean</display-name><path>/2019/02/interim-arts-dean</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/02/interim-arts-dean</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1551996275962</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1551996275962</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I am delighted to announce that Edward (Ted) Warburton, a professor of dance in our theater arts department, has been named UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s interim arts dean, effective immediately.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Ted joined UC Santa Cruz in 2004 as an assistant professor, coming from New York University, where he was director of dance education. He received his early training at the North Carolina School of the Arts and danced professionally with the American Ballet Theater, Houston Ballet, and Boston Ballet. In between dancing professionally, he earned a bachelor&#8217;s in English and dramatic literature at Boston College, then a doctorate in human development and psychology at Harvard University.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Ted&#8216;s record of service on our campus and across the country is impressive. He has served as associate arts dean and director of our Arts Research Institute. He has also served on a number of Academic Senate committees as well as Porter College&#8217;s Executive and Academic standing committees. He has demonstrated a long-term commitment to divisional development and outreach, giving talks at alumni, emeriti, student, trustee, and UC- wide events.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Ted is a wonderful choice to lead our Arts Division. Not only is he a talented and successful artist himself, he brings to the role a profound concern for faculty, staff, and students, along with an earnest commitment to our Principles of Community.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I am deeply grateful to Lori Kletzer, vice provost and dean of graduate studies. Since December, she has served the Arts Division and campus with integrity, compassion, and a wonderfully collaborative spirit as acting and then interim arts dean. She will work closely with Ted for the immediate term, remaining part of the Arts Leadership team and serving as a special adviser.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0 0;">Campus will soon launch a search for a permanent dean.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6ea7190980727017244b86d98c5051ff"><name>phased-retirement-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Phased Retirement Program Update</title><summary>This notice is to inform you that the Phased Retirement program is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2019.</summary><start-date>1552287600000</start-date><display-name>Phased Retirement Program Update</display-name><path>/2019/02/phased-retirement-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/02/phased-retirement-program</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1552339637646</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1552339637646</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This notice is to inform you that the Phased Retirement program is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2019.
