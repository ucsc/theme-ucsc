there to hear it, does it feel pain and loneliness? No, experts argue in an opinion article published July 3 in the journal <em>Trends in Plant Science</em>. They draw this conclusion from the research of Todd Feinberg and Jon Mallatt, which explores the evolution of consciousness through comparative studies of simple and complex animal brains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feinberg and Mallatt concluded that only vertebrates, arthropods, and cephalopods possess the threshold brain structure for consciousness. And if there are animals that don&#8217;t have consciousness, then you can be pretty confident that plants, which don't even have neurons, let alone brains, don't have it either,&#8221; says Lincoln Taiz, professor emeritus of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The topic of whether plants can think, learn, and intentionally choose their actions has been under debate since the establishment of plant neurobiology as a field in 2006 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2006.06.009">10.1016/j.tplants.2006.06.009</a>). Taiz was an original signer of a letter, also in <em>Trends in Plant Science</em> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2007.03.002">10.1016/j.tplants.2007.03.002</a>), arguing against the suggestion that plants have neurobiology to study at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest danger of anthropomorphizing plants in research is that it undermines the objectivity of the researcher,&#8221; Taiz says. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve seen is that plants and animals evolved very different life strategies. The brain is a very expensive organ, and there's absolutely no advantage to the plant to have a highly developed nervous system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plant neurobiology proponents draw parallels between electrical signaling in plants and nervous systems in animals. But Taiz and his co-authors argue that the proponents draw this parallel by describing the brain as something no more complex than a sponge. The Feinberg-Mallatt model of consciousness, by contrast, describes a specific level of organizational complexity of the brain that is required for subjective experience.</p>
<p>Plants use electrical signals in two ways: to regulate the distribution of charged molecules across membranes and to send messages long-distance across the organism. In the former, a plant&#8217;s leaves might curl up because the movement of ions resulted in movement of water out of the cells, which changes their shape; and in the latter, an insect bite on one leaf might initiate defense responses of distant leaves. Both actions can appear like a plant is choosing to react to a stimulus, but Taiz and his co-authors emphasize that these responses are genetically encoded and have been fine-tuned through generations of natural selection.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel a special responsibility to take a public position because I'm a co-author of a plant physiology textbook,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I know a lot of people in the plant neurobiology community would like to see their field in the textbooks, but so far, there are just too many unanswered questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>One frequently referenced study on plant learning is the apparent habituation of <em>Mimosa pudica</em> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7">10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7</a>). In this experiment, a plant is dropped, and its leaves curl up in defense. After being dropped many times, but sustaining no serious damage, the leaves stop curling. When the plant is shaken, the leaves do curl, ostensibly ruling out motor fatigue as a cause of the lack of response when dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;The shaking was actually quite violent. Because the shaking stimulus was stronger than the dropping stimulus, it doesn&#8217;t definitively rule out sensory adaptation, which doesn&#8217;t involve learning,&#8221; Taiz argues. &#8220;Related experiments with peas purporting to show Pavlovian classical conditioning are also problematical because of the lack of sufficient controls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taiz and his co-authors hope that further research will address the questions left unanswered by current plant neurobiology experiments by using more stringent conditions and controls.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="afa96ab28072701734bebd3c062a1f1c"><name>luce-seacoast</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz establishes interdisciplinary Southeast Asia research center</title><summary>A $1 million grant from the Henry Luce Foundation will establish a new Center for Southeast Asian Coastal Interactions (SEACoast) at UC Santa Cruz that will bring together scholars from the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences to address the region's challenges. </summary><keywords>SEACoast, Luce, southeast asia</keywords><start-date>1561964400000</start-date><display-name>Luce-SEACoast</display-name><path>/2019/07/luce-seacoast</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/07/luce-seacoast</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1562020243316</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1563991129674</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value><value>Anthropology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/07/images/luce-coral_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/07/images/luce-coral_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>luce-coral_300.jpg</name><display-name>luce-coral_300.jpg</display-name><file-size>39313</file-size><width>300</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>Photo of corals on the Cyrene Reef in Singapore</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/07/images/luce-coral_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/07/images/luce-coral_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>luce-coral_80.jpg</name><display-name>luce-coral_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>6550</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of corals on the Cyrene Reef in Singapore</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Situated in one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, the corals surviving on the submerged Cyrene Reef in Singapore are often described as rainforests of the sea.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Special places deserve special care, which is precisely what a new UC Santa Cruz collaborative will bring to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Home to some of the most diverse and vibrant ecological zones in the world, Southeast Asia is threatened by a daunting array of environmental, economic, cultural, and political forces. Forests are being transformed into shrimp farms, coastal cities like Jakarta are sinking into the mud, and islands are disappearing as the region undergoes tremendous change.</p>
<p>Funded by a $1 million grant from the Henry Luce Foundation, the new Center for Southeast Asian Coastal Interactions (SEACoast) at UC Santa Cruz will bring together scholars from the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences to address the region's challenges. Led by Anna Tsing and Megan Thomas, professor of anthropology and associate professor of politics, respectively, SEACoast aims to cultivate what they call "slow science," nurture the next generation of scholars, strengthen work in Southeast Asia at UCSC, and energize the field of Southeast Asian studies.</p>
<p>"Our Center will bring Southeast Asian studies into the pressing environmental questions of this era, marked by the unrelenting force of human impact on the planet,&#8221; said Tsing, a former Guggenheim Fellow who is widely recognized for her pioneering, interdisciplinary work. "SEACoast will renew area studies by integrating social and natural scientists and transforming the type of questions that are explored, as well as the way they are investigated."</p>
<p>Driven by sweeping social and environmental change, the crises emerging in Southeast Asia reflect problems that are unfolding around the world. The scope and urgency of these problems demand a new approach, which is why Tsing and Thomas are embracing "slow science."</p>
<p>"SEACoast will be unique in the world," said Tsing.</p>
<p>Allocated over five years, the grant was funded as part of the foundation's <a href="https://www.hluce.org/programs/asia/grant-categories/luce-initiative-southeast-asia/">Luce Initiative on Southeast Asia</a>, which encourages innovation in Southeast Asian studies, including disciplinary collaboration, and partnerships with individuals and institutions outside academia.&#160;</p>
<p><strong><em>Slow science</em></strong></p>
<p>"Southeast Asia has always been a region of incredible biological diversity, linguistic and cultural diversity, and intense exchanges through trade and migration," said Thomas. "Environmental change in Southeast Asia is particularly pressing, and it allows a window into processes that are happening in the rest of the world."</p>
<p>"Slow science" can address the disciplinary divide that has historically separated natural scientists from their counterparts in the social sciences and humanities, as well as the pace of scientific inquiry. Tackling the enormous impacts humans have had on climate and the environment requires overcoming this divide and allowing more time for reflective conversations, said Tsing.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia&#8212;a region that encompasses Brunei, Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam&#8212;human activities such as mining, logging, dam construction, groundwater extraction, salt production, fishing, trade, and coastal development are propelling change. Many of these activities are having devastating, often unintended, effects, including flooding; the spread of invasive species; loss of forests, swamps, and wetlands; sediment flows that suffocate coral reefs; and the buildup of urban trash that infiltrates waterways, decimates marine life, impoverishes fishing populations, and drives migration to cities. At the same time, social and political revolutions, religion, and governance are powerful levers that exert significant effects, as well.</p>
<p>"The human and natural sciences have worked across an intellectual rift that has caused all sorts of problems on both sides," said Tsing. "This is a wake-up call."</p>
<p>By working across history, anthropology, biology, and ecology, SEACoast will become a model of how to address urgent regional issues. A unique focus on coastal "interactions" will emphasize the interplay of humans and ecology, with an inclusive scope broad enough to include commodity chains, governance, interspecies dynamics, and more. As one example, Tsing noted the importance of vernacular local knowledge in setting new agendas for biological inquiry. She is working with ornithologist Kristof Zyskowski, collections manager at Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History, to understand how tropical birds respond to various modes and histories of human disturbance in Indonesia. Tsing is incorporating local knowledge about the history and habits of birds into her work, which encompasses studying the relationship of local and international natural histories. To delve into such questions requires collaborations across the human and natural sciences.</p>
<p>The concept of "slow science" resets expectations to value deliberation and the careful study of human and nonhuman actors and history, rather than a rush to pursue questions that will yield quick results. It also leaves room for what Tsing calls the "serendipitous developments" of fieldwork.</p>
<p>For example, Tsing works with Joe Klein, a graduate student in anthropology at UC Santa Cruz, as well as biologists Peter Funch, an associate professor at Aarhus University in Denmark, and Stine Vestbo, a graduate student at Aarhus, to study the trade in live corals in Sulawesi. Their work has documented marine sponges traveling in the porous coral substrate, creating potential pathways for species invasions.</p>
<p>Another project, a study of harmful algal blooms in the Johor Straits, undertaken by Zahirah Suhaimi, a UCSC graduate student in anthropology, examines how environmental changes such as coastal development, climate change, and harmful algal blooms are impacting human and nonhuman communities. Tsing is also working with Gillian Bogart, a graduate student in anthropology, whose research investigates ecologies of coastal salt production in Timor and their entanglements with state capitalist ventures and local relations.</p>
<p>"This is exactly the approach we need to take to address the complexity of the problems we're facing in the world today," said Katharyne Mitchell, dean of the Division of Social Sciences, which will be the institutional home of the new center. "We need to take the time to allow scholars trained in diverse disciplines to accommodate each other's thinking. We need the flexibility to respond to each other as we learn together."</p>
<p><strong><em>Next generation</em></strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is widely recognized for its pioneering, interdisciplinary programs and for making paradigm-shifting research contributions in anthropology, astrophysics, genomics, and other fields. Following in the footsteps of the Center for Cultural Studies and the Science and Justice Research Center, Tsing and Thomas imagine that SEACoast will be another small hub of innovation that will generate outsized impacts.</p>
<p>"It is very exciting to be part of this timely opportunity to bring collaborative research and teaching to bear on the world's most pressing ecological challenges," said Acting Humanities Dean Karen Bassi, noting that faculty from the Arts Division and Physical and Biological Sciences will participate, as well. "SEACoast will provide resources for faculty, students, and visiting scholars to study the complex relationship between ecological, ethical, and political developments in Southeast Asia and beyond."</p>
<p>The Luce grant will directly fund team-conducted fieldwork in Southeast Asia. The new center will nurture the next generation of Southeast Asian researchers by supporting graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, while building collaborations with institutions in Denmark, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Rich programming will include monthly "slow seminars," interdisciplinary field exercises, and quarterly lab meetings. SEACoast will also host visiting scholars for talks, workshops, project consultation, and informal discussions.</p>
<p>SEACoast enjoys widespread campus support: It will be housed in the Institute for Social Transformation; the Humanities Division has agreed to create a faculty position for a scholar of Southeast Asian environmental history; and the Office of Research called the proposal "extraordinarily well-aligned with our campus's strengths, plans, and focuses moving forward."&#160;<span>In January, Tsing and Thomas received a grant of nearly $25,000 from the UC Santa Cruz Foundation's&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://foundation.ucsc.edu/opportunity-fund/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1564076352448000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH4sgWpbpqb3hsJPVTS7enjhKVLgg" href="https://foundation.ucsc.edu/opportunity-fund/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Board Opportunity Fund</a><span>&#160;to help fund the recruitment of a first-year graduate student, which bolstered their proposal to the Luce Foundation.</span></p>
<p>Quentin Williams, vice provost and dean of graduate studies, applauded SEACoast's emphasis on supporting the next generation of scholars. "This new center will be an incubator for new ideas, and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will help bring them to life," he said. "Early-career scholars are the future of Southeast Asian studies, and SEACoast, building on assistance from the Luce Foundation,&#160;will position them for great success."</p>

It is an honor to have the opportunity to serve UC Santa Cruz and I look forward to getting to know you and the campus. I have already received such a warm welcome from our campus, the greater Santa Cruz community, and the strong network of alumni and friends. Thank you all for your support, teamwork, and feedback throughout this transition.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">During my first weeks and months on campus, I look forward to working with you all to better understand the issues we face and the strengths we can grow together. I share UCSC&#8217;s commitment to purpose-driven inquiry, research excellence, and ensuring equity and access to higher education and I am eager to learn more about how our campus can best live out these values.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I would also like to announce some changes to the structure of the Chancellor&#8217;s Office. Ashish Sahni, who has served as chief of staff and associate chancellor for Chancellor Emeritus George Blumenthal, will now serve as special assistant to the chancellor into the fall. I would like to commend Ashish for his contributions to campus over the past 13 years. He has overseen our Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion since its creation in 2010 and has been very helpful during this leadership transition.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Teresa Maria Linda Scholz, the campus diversity officer for staff and students, has agreed to serve as interim assistant vice chancellor for our Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, which will now report directly to the chancellor. Associate Vice Chancellor Jean Marie Scott will serve as our locally designated official for whistleblower matters. Anna Finn will be joining my office as associate chancellor and chief of staff. She previously worked with me as special assistant to the provost at UC Riverside where she managed numerous special projects related to the academic enterprise. She begins her role today as well and you can reach her at annaf@ucsc.edu.</p>

Are Not Princesses</strong></em><em>, </em>the first feature film by UC Santa Cruz alumna Bridgette Auger (SocDoc &#8217;11) was honored with the Audience Award for Best Feature at the <strong><a href="https://sfindie.com/docfest-2019-award-winners/">2019&#160;San Francisco Documentary Film Festival</a></strong><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p><em></em>This year&#8217;s festival was the highest attended event in the SF DocFest&#8217;s 18-year history, with over 10,000 attendees filling the Roxie and Brava theaters in the city for 16 days of non-fiction film.</p>
<p>Featuring 86 films in 87 screenings, it was additionally&#160;attended by 123 filmmakers, traveling from as far away as Shanghai and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Auger&#8217;s film is about four Syrian women, living as refugees in Beirut, Lebanon, who come together to tell their personal stories of love, loss, despair, and hope through exploration of the ancient Greek play, <em>Antigone</em>.</p>
<p>Auger directed and filmed the 75-minute documentary in collaboration with London-based Syrian filmmaker Itab Azzam. The film had its world premiere last November at<em> DOC NYC, </em>the largest documentary film festival in the United States.</p>
<p><em>We Are Not Princesses </em>was inspired by an eight-week theater workshop titled &#8220;Antigone of Syria&#8221; that was put together by the Open Art Foundation for Syrian women refugees in Lebanon. It was designed to help the women find community, heal, and process their trauma as a result of the ongoing war in Syria.</p>
<p>Shot over three months in the autumn of 2014, the film uses intimate footage and animation to show how these resilient women are picking up the pieces of their lives and putting them back together&#8212;despite the seemingly endless tragic conditions back home in Syria.</p>
<p>An artist and filmmaker committed to using art for social change, Auger received her Master&#8217;s degree in Social Documentation from UC Santa Cruz in 2011. Prior to that, she earned a degree in photography and imaging from New York University&#8217;s Tisch School of the Arts.</p>
<p>She lived in the Middle East for several years, covering the Arab Spring in Egypt and Libya, as well as the refugee crisis from the conflict in Syria, through photography and video. Her work has taken her to a variety of other countries, including Iraqi Kurdistan, Kashmir, Mongolia, and China.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/11/auger-syrian-film.html</url><title>SocDoc alumnaâ€™s film about Syrian women refugees to have world premiere at DOC NYC</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2013/07/auger-syria-alumna.html</url><title>Soc Doc alumnaâ€™s work with Syrian refugees featured on CBS News</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2011/11/Egypt-alum.html</url><title>Soc Doc alumna reports from Egyptâ€™s Tahrir Square</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b988946b8072701734bebd3cbcc62868"><name>schmidt-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Holger Schmidt receives IEEE Photonics Society Engineering Achievement Award</title><summary>Schmidt is a professor of electrical and computer engineering and holds the Narinder Kapany chair in Optoelectronics in the Baskin School of Engineering.</summary><start-date>1562137200000</start-date><display-name>Holger Schmidt receives IEEE Photonics Society Engineering Achievement Award</display-name><path>/2019/07/schmidt-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/07/schmidt-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1562185863281</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1562186142898</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/holger-schmidt-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/holger-schmidt-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>holger-schmidt-350.jpg</name><display-name>holger-schmidt-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>75496</file-size><width>350</width><height>432</height></image><image-alt>Holger Schmidt</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/holger-schmidt-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/holger-schmidt-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>holger-schmidt-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>holger-schmidt-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14692</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Holger Schmidt</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Holger Schmidt (photo by C.

<p>The award recognizes Schmidt and his long-time collaborator, Aaron Hawkins at Brigham Young University, for "the invention and development of optofluidic waveguides and their applications, in particular commercialization for biomedical diagnostics."</p>
<p>The hollow-core optical waveguides they developed can be integrated into chips using standard silicon fabrication technology, enabling light propagation through tiny volumes of liquids on a chip. Diagnostic instruments based on these "optofluidic chips" offer the potential for a rapid, low-cost, and portable option for identifying molecular biomarkers and other disease-related bioparticles such as whole viruses.</p>
<p>Schmidt holds the Narinder Kapany chair in Optoelectronics and directs the W. M. Keck Nanofabrication Facility at UC Santa Cruz. He also serves as associate dean for research in the Baskin School of Engineering. His research covers a broad range in photonics and integrated optics, including optofluidic devices, atom photonics, nano-magneto-optics, and spintronic devices.</p>
<p>The IEEE Photonics Society Engineering Achievement Award is given to recognize an exceptional engineering contribution which has had a significant impact on the development of laser or electro-optic technology or the commercial application of technology within the past 10 years. The award, which consists of an honorarium of $2,000 and a medal, will be presented at the IEEE Photonics Conference in October.</p>
<p>Schmidt has authored more than 400 publications, several book chapters, and co-edited the <em>CRC Handbook of Optofluidics</em> with Hawkins. He is a Fellow of the IEEE and the Optical Society of America, and received an NSF Career Award and a Keck Futures Nanotechnology Award. He earned his M.S. in physics from the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering at UC Santa Barbara. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2001.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

<p class="gmail-p3">On Thursday June 27, 2019 Primo&#8217;s 40-year-old heart performed its last beat. For 25 years, the rhythmic pulse of his heart was central to our cetacean biology program at the Long Marine Lab campus of UC Santa Cruz. The detailed, roller-coaster changes in Primo&#8217;s heart rate as he swam and dived with graceful agility had never been witnessed before in any dolphin or whale; no one knew what happened to a dolphin&#8217;s heart when they exercised underwater. His was the first deep-dive electrocardiogram ever measured for a freely-swimming cetacean. That scientific discovery was made possible by a fortuitous combination of miniaturized suction-cup tag technology, dogged scientific persistence, the creativity of his dedicated long-time trainers who included Traci Kendall and Beau Richter, and of course, Primo&#8217;s enthusiastic willingness to be a part of our science. <span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p class="gmail-p3">Unlike more skittish dolphins, Primo was bold&#8212;his trainers might even say stubborn&#8212;and always relished the challenge of a good scientific problem to solve. Perhaps it was his military training that shaped his steadfast spirit, for Primo was a veteran of the U.S. Navy Mine-Hunting Program during the Gulf War years of the early 90s. It was my shared luck to be assigned with Primo to the research arm of that Naval program in Hawaii; our luck continued when government base closures resulted in Primo&#8217;s retirement and college-assisted military discharge in 1994 to Long Marine Lab, where I had just started working. <span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p class="gmail-p3">When his military service and age prevented release back into the wild, Primo became our scientific partner and teacher of all things dolphin. His first scientific paper about the energy dolphins saved while surfing the wakes of boats made the cover of the international scientific journal, <i>Nature</i>, with the headline &#8220;Why Dolphins Catch a Wave&#8221;. The remarkable changes in his heart rate and in the rates of other dolphins and whales that followed in his fluke steps led to broad, and at times unexpected, applications. Over the years, Primo&#8217;s science has helped to explain the impacts of climate-change and over-fishing on wild dolphin populations, offered new insights as to why whales strand due to seismic noise and military sonar exposure in the oceans, and even reduced the number of race day deaths in human tri-athletes.<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&#160; &#160;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p class="gmail-p3">There is not enough space to detail all of Primo&#8217;s talents and accomplishments or the level of love he received from his Long Marine Lab family.<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&#160; </span>Suffice it to say that he was much more than a scientist. He was an ambassador and teacher of dolphin conservation to thousands of campus visitors, scientists, and most importantly students of all ages.<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&#160; </span>He was a ham in front of cameras, with his crooked smile helping to earn an Oscar nomination for the IMAX movie,&#160;<i>Dolphins</i>. He helped learning disabled children speak, Make-A-Wish families smile, and inspired an entire new generation of marine conservationists. Incredibly, Primo did all of this as a retired veteran moving into his senior years.<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p class="gmail-p3">He taught all of us that sometimes we learn more from our hearts than our heads. We will cherish our time with him forever.<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&#160; &#160; &#160;</span></p>

<p class="gmail-p3">The Division of Undergraduate Education announced the appointment of Marcia Ochoa as Oakes College interim provost, effective July 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p class="gmail-p3">Ochoa is an anthropologist who specializes in the ethnography of media. Ochoa&#8217;s first book was on the accomplishment of femininity among beauty pageant contestants (misses) and transgender women (transformistas) in Venezuela.<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p class="gmail-p3">Ochoa&#8217;s work focuses on the role of the imaginary in the survival of queer and transgender people in Latin America, and on the emerging social movement of translatinas, or transgender women who migrate from Latin America to the US and Europe.<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p class="gmail-p3">Ochoa works with El/La Para TransLatinas in the Mission District of San Francisco, CA to develop programming and social justice work that promotes transgender Latina social participation and reflects the style and grace of translatina survival. Professor Ochoa is also co-editor of GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies.<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p class="gmail-p3">Ochoa is an associate professor of Feminist Studies, Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, and Social Documentation at UC Santa Cruz. In 2018-19, she/they served as associate provost at Oakes College.</p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p class="gmail-p3">In assuming the interim provost role, Ochoa continues a long-term commitment to Oakes College as a place that welcomes and supports underrepresented and first-generation college students.</p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p class="gmail-p3">&#8220;My goal in accepting this great honor and responsibility is to keep the Oakes love flowing by supporting our many community engagement and student support programs, and to welcome the next provost of the college,&#8221; Ochoa said.<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p class="gmail-p3">Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education (VPDUE) Richard Hughey noted that Oakes College is a unique community of learning dedicated to helping students from many backgrounds achieve their educational goals.<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p class="gmail-p3">&#8220;I was excited to discuss with Marcia ways in which they may bring their transnational, multicultural, and tri-lingual research in gender studies to Oakes&#8217; students, curriculum, and programs,&#8221; he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p class="gmail-p3">Hughey asked the campus to join in appreciation of Oakes College Provost Regina Langhout&#8217;s five years of service.

He was 89.</p>
<p>Born in 1930 in London, England, Rose received his B.A. and M.A. from King's College, Cambridge. He is the co-author of a 1964 book titled <em>Camford Observed: An Investigation of the Ancient Universities in the Modern World,</em> an account of university life at Oxford and Cambridge that contained ideas that would have a major impact on the formation of UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Rose was a faculty member at UCSC&#8217;s Cowell College when it opened in 1965. He became the second provost of Cowell from 1970-1974. Rose spent the next decade teaching at Cowell until 1983, when he briefly served as a faculty member of Porter College (formerly College V) until his retirement in 1986 as an emeritus professor.</p>
<p>Current Cowell provost Alan Christy noted that Rose was one of the most beloved figures in the history of the Cowell college community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Countless students, colleagues, and faculty from the first 20 years of UCSC had their lives transformed by their contact with Jasper,&#8221; said Christy. "In fact, there is no telling the story of Cowell without telling the story of Jasper Rose. He was a founding faculty member, a central part of what set this new campus apart from its opening day in 1965. His classic history of Oxford and Cambridge was an influence on fellow founders like Page Smith in imagining what college life could look like, and what a collegiate university could accomplish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He also brought his personal experience as a fellow of Cambridge&#8212;and his dynamic style as a consummate Englishman&#8212;to communicate the gravity, breadth, and joie de vivre of college life,&#8221; Christy added. &#8220;He worked tirelessly to create an experience, not just an education, for his students, who remember him as a gifted teacher in and outside of the classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greatly admired by his students as a teacher, mentor, artist, and historian, Rose was influential in fostering the growth of the arts on campus and instrumental in launching the Cowell Press. He held waltzes in the dining hall, and with his wife, Jean, welcomed students to the provost house, inviting them to paint and express their artistic talents.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, he also taught extraordinary classes on the history of landscape painting with fellow Cowell faculty member, Mary Holmes (1910-2002). He sponsored classes in stained glass window making at Cowell in the mid 70s, and those windows can still be seen on campus today&#8212;on the walkway down to the Cowell dining hall, and near the stairs of the faculty offices.</p>
<p>And just this spring, an exhibition of Rose&#8217;s watercolor portraits painted from memory was on display at The Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery at Cowell.</p>
<p>&#8220;While Jasper in time left Cowell for Porter, and later left the university altogether, we remain his first and lasting home,&#8221; said Christy. &#8220;His legacy deserves greater recognition on campus, because there is little in Cowell that doesn&#8217;t bear his stamp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year, an oral history was conducted with Jasper about his life and work at UCSC,&#8221; Christy noted. &#8220;It is currently being edited and will be released later this year for anyone who wants to hear Jasper&#8217;s story and legacy in his own words.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rose is survived by his wife, Jean, and his sons William and Inigo.</p>

<p>The highlight of the weekend will be the induction of 10 prominent women into the Hall of Fame for their historic achievements. UC Santa Cruz distinguished professor emerita Angela Davis will be one of those women receiving that honor.</p>
<p>Her fellow inductees will include attorney and activist <strong>Gloria Allred, </strong>U.S. Supreme Court Justice<strong> Sonia Sotomayor</strong>, Native American lawyer and professor <strong>Sarah Deer</strong>, actress and activist <strong>Jane Fonda, </strong>United States Air Force officer <strong>Nicole Malachowski</strong>, former member of U.S. Congress <strong>Louise Slaughter</strong>, composer<strong> Laurie Spiegel</strong>, biologist<strong> Flossie Wong-Staal</strong>, and artist/activist <strong>Rose O&#8217;Neill</strong>.</p>
<p>The 2019 class of inductees were nominated by the public, judged by an interdisciplinary team of experts across the nominees&#8217; fields, and selected for their invaluable contributions to American Society in the areas of the arts, athletics, business, education, government, humanities, philanthropy, and science.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to add these American women to the ranks of inductees whose leadership and achievements have changed the course of American history," noted Betty Bayer, president of The National Women&#8217;s Hall of Fame.</p>
<p><span><strong>Through her activism and scholarship</strong></span><span> over many decades, Davis has been deeply involved in movements for social justice around the world.&#160;</span><span>Her work as an educator--both at the university level and in the larger public sphere--has always emphasized the importance of building communities of struggle for economic, racial, and gender justice.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Davis spent 15 years as a faculty member at UC Santa Cruz until her retirement in 2008 as a Distinguished Professor Emerita of History of Consciousness (an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program) and Feminist Studies.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>She is the author of 10 books and has lectured throughout the United States as well as in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and South America.&#160;</span><span>In recent years she has focused on the range of social problems associated with incarceration and the generalized criminalization of those communities that are most affected by poverty and racial discrimination.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>In her work, Davis draws upon her own experience in the early 1970s as a person who spent 18 months in jail and on trial, after being placed on the FBI&#8217;s &#8220;Ten Most Wanted List.&#8221;&#160;She has also conducted extensive research on numerous issues related to race, gender and imprisonment.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

<p>Humans are top predators of many wildlife species, and our mere presence can create a "landscape of fear," according to researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Fear of humans suppresses the movement and activity of pumas, bobcats, skunks, and opossums, which benefits small mammals. As their own predators respond to their fear of humans, deer mice and wood rats perceive <em>less </em>risk and in turn forage for food farther away and more intensively, they found.</p>
<p>The new study, "Fear of Humans as Apex Predators has Landscape-scale Impacts from Mountain Lions to Mice," appears in the July 17 online edition of the journal <em>Ecology Letters</em>.</p>
<p>"Humans are sufficiently scary to pumas and smaller predators that they suppressed their behavior and changed the way they used their habitats when they thought we were around," said lead author Justin Suraci, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz. "The most surprising part was seeing how those changes benefit rodents."</p>
<p>The findings are significant because as humans encroach on wild lands around the globe, ecologists are eager to understand the effects humans and development have on wildlife.</p>
<p>"We've spent 10 years learning how fear of humans drives mountain lion physiology, behavior, and ecology," said senior author Chris Wilmers, a professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz and director of the <a href="http://www.santacruzpumas.org/">Santa Cruz Puma Project</a>. "This is the first large-scale experiment I'm aware of that documents how fear cascades through the food web from top predators to the smallest prey."</p>
<p>The research reveals that the presence of humans can have fairly profound effects, even without activities and infrastructure like hunting or housing or roads, said Wilmers, who studies human-wildlife interactions in California, Africa, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>"With human population growth and development, there is often a dual mandate to preserve wildlife and give people access to open spaces," he said. "This research starts to get at how we can realistically do both. We need to understand how animals react to our presence to make decisions and craft policies that protect their wellbeing."</p>
<p><strong>Experiment design and results</strong></p>
<p>Suraci and Wilmers designed a clever experiment that used recordings of human voices to assess the landscape-level effects of fear of humans. At two remote research sites in the Santa Cruz Mountains that are closed to public access, they placed 25 speakers in a grid pattern across a one-square-kilometer area. The speakers broadcast human voices, and recordings of tree frogs as a control.</p>
<p>Pumas, the researchers found, responded to the sound of human voices by significantly reducing their activity, keeping their distance, and slowing their movements. "When the frog recordings played, they would move right through the landscape," said Suraci. "But when they heard human voices, they went out of their way to avoid the grid."</p>
<p>Medium-sized predators changed their behavior in significant ways, too: Bobcats became much more nocturnal; skunks reduced their overall activity by 40 percent; and opossums reduced their foraging activity by a stunning 66 percent. "Bobcats pretty much gave up on daytime activity, shifting almost entirely to the night, when they presumably feel safer," said Suraci. "These predators aren't necessarily leaving the area, they're just less active, presumably because they're hiding more."</p>
<p>Over time, these behavioral changes could have dire consequences for pumas and the other predators if their food intake drops, said Suraci.</p>
<p>By contrast, deer mice increased their range by 45 percent, and the intensity of foraging by mice and wood rats increased by 17 percent. "They were apparently responding to the reduced activity of everybody else," Suraci added. "They're feeling braver, so they're moving around more and finding more food. They're not too averse to people, so they're taking advantage of the opportunity."</p>
<p>For wildlife, fear amounts to the <em>perception </em>of predation risk, explained Suraci. "Humans are incredibly lethal," he said. "We are major predators, and thus a source of fear, for a lot of these species. What's novel about this study is that we can see what that fear looks like in the environment at a relatively large scale."</p>
<p>Unlike studies that assess the impacts of development and subsequent habitat fragmentation, this research focused on the impacts of humans themselves.</p>
<p>"Just the fear of humans can affect how wildlife use the landscape and how they interact with each other," said Suraci. "It turns out, the mere perceived presence of humans triggers a disruption of natural predator-prey interactions&#8212;and rodents really benefit."</p>
<p>Suraci is eager to investigate the relative impacts, or "cost/benefits," of living near humans for certain species. "Smaller carnivores don't want to interact with humans, but that may be outweighed by the benefits of feeding on trash&#8212;and potentially being protected from pumas," he said.

<p>2019 marks the 39th<sup> </sup>year of the popular annual gathering, which takes place the week of July 14-20, and the featured book this year is one of Dickens lesser-known works, <em>Barnaby Rudge</em>. &#160;</p>
<p>Set in 18th-century London, the novel tells a powerful story of public violence and private horror. It depicts the 1780 anti-Catholic riots that have been described by historians as the largest, deadliest and most protracted urban uprisings in British history.</p>
<p>John Jordan, director and co-founder of the Dickens Project explained why this particular book was selected as the featured novel this year.</p>
<p><em>Barnaby Rudg</em>e is seldom read in part because it is a historical novel, set in the 18th century, that deals with a relatively obscure event--the Gordon riots of 1780,&#8221; said Jordan. &#8220;Those riots were a major event of lawlessness, fomented by strong anti-Catholic feeling that culminated in five days of reckless destruction of life and property across London.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We felt it was time to revisit this strange, neglected novel to see what it might have to offer to a new generation of readers. It turns out that <em>Rudge</em> has surprising and suggestive parallels with events in our own times, including the rise of nationalism and the violent treatment of foreigners.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>One of the highlights</strong> at this year&#8217;s Dickens Universe will be a featured exhibit related to the novel that is coming to the campus from Los Angeles along with a contingent of students and their teacher, Jacqueline Barrios. A graduate student in English at UCLA, Barrios is using Dickens&#8217; novel to explore the impact and history of the Los Angeles riots of 1992 with her high school students from South LA at the James A. Foshay Learning Center.</p>
<p>The exhibit is the culmination of extensive study of Dickens&#8217; <em>Barnaby Rudge</em> by the high school seniors in their AP English Literature class taught by Barrios through her &#8220;Lit Labs.&#8221; &#160;With support from a partnership with the Dickens Project, Barrios brings in experts from a variety of disciplines to teach her students the featured Dickens Universe book of the year&#8212;in ways that they can relate to.</p>
<p>Barrios&#8217;s students are scholars with USC&#8217;s Neighborhood Academic Initiative (NAI), a college pathway program targeted at preparing first-generation students for higher education. NAI partners with the Dickens Project to support the Lit Lab projects, utilizing new teaching techniques to close the gap between their modern urban experience and the historical world of Dickens.</p>
<p>&#8220;For this year&#8217;s project, I knew they were going to read <em>Barnaby Rudge</em>,&#8221; said Barrios. &#8220;The energy comes from Dickens telling stories of the city&#8217;s urban uprising. I couldn&#8217;t really teach that in South LA without addressing the 1992 LA riots and addressing the history of LA urban riots.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she had the students take their study of 19th century literature out of the classroom and into the streets to explore the connections between the London riots of 1870 and the Los Angeles riots of 1992. &#8220;I cast my students as storytellers of the two uprisings,&#8221; said Barrios. &#8220;I asked them &#8220;how can you be the Dickens of your times?&#8221;</p>
<p>The students did research, made sound recordings, interviewed people who lived in that area during the riots, and put together content for an exhibit that will be on display at the Eloise Smith Gallery at Cowell during the entire week of the Dickens Universe.</p>
<p>Titled <em>LA 1992 / London 1780: Sounding Out a Crowd</em>, the exhibition highlights an album they created called <em>Never Say Die: A Sonic Tribute to the LA 1992 Rebellion</em>, a compilation of sound projects inspired by studying the representation of the two urban uprisings&#8212;one from the distant past, and the other in their own neighborhood more than 25 years ago. To produce the album, the students collected sounds for a South LA sonic archive to produce an alternative map of the historical event.</p>
<p>Visitors to the Cowell exhibit will find listening panels juxtaposing the two different uprisings, artwork of album covers for songs and poetry the students created, and a mapping installation.</p>
<p>Barrios and five of her students will present a talk about the project plus a small performance at the gallery on Tuesday, July 16, at 5 p.m. during the week of the Dickens Universe. Admission is free and the public is invited to attend.</p>
<p>In fact, all Dickens Universe events on July 16 after 3 p.m. will be open to the public to experience the Dickens Universe. Admission is free to all of these events (with the exception of dinner which will include a fee).

<p>Joining the&#160;Breakthrough Listen initiative&#8217;s ongoing radio frequency survey and spectroscopic optical laser survey, VERITAS (the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) will search for pulsed optical beacons with its array of four 12-meter telescopes at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Amado, Arizona.</p>
<p>VERITAS is the world&#8217;s most powerful telescope array for studying high-energy astrophysics with gamma rays. It detects gamma rays coming from space by looking for the extremely brief flashes of blue &#8220;Cherenkov&#8221; light they create when they hit the top of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>VERITAS will look for pulsed optical beacons with durations as short as several nanoseconds. Over such timescales, artificial beacons could easily outshine any stars that lie in the same direction on the sky. The use of all four telescopes simultaneously allows for very effective discrimination against false positive detections. The VERITAS Collaboration has previously published observations of the mysteriously dimming Boyajian&#8217;s Star in search of such optical pulses. The new program of VERITAS observations will provide complementary searches for optical pulse signatures of many more stars from the primary Breakthrough Listen star list.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impressive how well-suited the VERITAS telescopes are for this project, since they were built only with the purpose of studying very-high-energy gamma rays in mind,&#8221; said David Williams, adjunct professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz and the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) and a member of the VERITAS collaboration.</p>
<p>Breakthrough Listen&#8217;s search for optical technosignatures with VERITAS will be led by Williams at UCSC and Jamie Holder of the University of Delaware, in collaboration with the Listen team at <a href="http://seti.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley&#8217;s SETI Research Center</a> led by Andrew Siemion.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to intelligent life beyond Earth, we don&#8217;t know where it exists or how it communicates,&#8221; said Yuri Milner, founder of the <a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/">Breakthrough Initiatives</a>. &#8220;So our philosophy is to look in as many places, and in as many ways, as we can. VERITAS expands our range of observation even further.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Breakthrough Listen is already the most powerful, comprehensive, and intensive search yet undertaken for signs of intelligent life beyond Earth,&#8221; Siemion said. &#8220;Now, with the addition of VERITAS, we&#8217;re sensitive to an important new class of signals: fast optical pulses. Optical communication has already been used by NASA to transmit high definition images to Earth from the moon, so there&#8217;s reason to believe that an advanced civilization might use a scaled-up version of this technology for interstellar communication.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a laser comparable to the most powerful lasers on Earth (delivering about 500 terawatts in a pulse lasting a few nanoseconds) were situated at the distance of Boyajian&#8217;s Star and pointed in our direction, VERITAS could detect it. But most of the stars in the Listen target list are 10 to 100 times closer than Boyajian&#8217;s Star, meaning that the new search will be sensitive to pulses a factor 100 to 10,000 times fainter still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using the huge mirror area of the four VERITAS telescopes will allow us to search for these extremely faint optical flashes in the night sky, which could correspond to signals from an extraterrestrial civilization,&#8221; said Holder.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fc2148548072701734bebd3c04926dfd"><name>affirming-the-rights</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Affirming the rights of our undocumented community members</title><summary>We write to strongly reaffirm that UC Santa Cruz will not participate in any immigration raids and will uphold the civil and privacy rights of all of our community members regardless of immigration status.</summary><start-date>1563260400000</start-date><display-name>Affirming the rights </display-name><path>/2019/07/affirming-the-rights</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/07/affirming-the-rights</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1563303167240</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1563303269793</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear campus community,</p>
<p>We write to strongly reaffirm that UC Santa Cruz will not participate in any immigration raids and will uphold the civil and privacy rights of all of our community members regardless of immigration status. The recently announced plan to increase immigration actions is designed to create fear and to divide our community. Instead, our community will stand together. Our campus is built on a foundation of social justice, and our commitment to the rights of our students and employees, without regard for immigration status, is essential to that foundation.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burning Man isn&#8217;t a place where you&#8217;d expect to find a presentation on research into the sleep patterns of marine mammals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the week-long extravaganza of creativity in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada is exactly where Jessica Kendall-Bar, a Ph.D. student in ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, plans to screen a dreamlike, animated video she created. The film centers on her study into the similarities and differences between the sleep patterns of humans and wild marine mammals through a fantastical story of an underwater friendship between a woman and a seal.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a cool project,&#8221; she says simply.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But cool projects seem to be the norm for the 25-year-old Kendall-Bar. Working with her advisers, UC Santa Cruz Professors of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Terrie Williams and Dan Costa, she is studying the way marine mammal brains can cope with both oxygen and sleep deprivation that would be harmful, and even fatal, to humans.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&#8217;s done field research in the Black Sea in Russia and free dove in 40 feet of water in Moorea to study the behavior of 9-foot-long, 60-pound moray eels. She&#8217;s illustrated two children&#8217;s books, created an educational video to explain carbon sequestration to students she was teaching at UC Berkeley, used wood-burning tools to create custom surfboard designs, and made short underwater films of her swimming through magical worlds of kelp and seagrass. Oh, and she is fluent in French and spends parts of her summer in France.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m inspired by art and its power to communicate scientific information,&#8221; says Kendall-Bar, during a Skype conversation from her cousin&#8217;s home in Avignon, France, where she is visiting. &#8220;I think my ability to lend a creative twist to this process is important.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a researcher, Kendall-Bar says she is fascinated by how wild marine mammals sleep, and she recently co-authored a paper with Oleg Lyamin, Jerry Siegel, Alexei Vyssotski, and Lev Mukhametov that built on research detailing how fur seals and sea lions in the family Otariidae were found to sleep with only one hemisphere of the brain at a time (like whales and dolphins) while in the water but with both hemispheres (the way humans sleep) when they are on land. The paper she co-authored showed the asymmetry in their brain activity was reflected in their eye state (whether the eyes were open or closed).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Learning about these patterns in marine mammals can not only inform our conservation policies for protecting threatened species,&#8221; Kendall-Bar says, &#8220;but it can also teach us about the function of sleep for all mammals.&#8221; It&#8217;s especially interesting in light of statistics that show human sleep deprivation costs the United States $411 billion each year, she adds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the daughter of an architect and a professor of communications is also passionate about art, which she sees as a tool to explain science in ways non-scientists can understand. So, when writer Sue Partenheimer approached her about illustrating a children&#8217;s book exploring stories of creatures who make an abandoned oil rig their home, Kendall-Bar agreed, and worked on the illustrations while doing her research in Russia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a book illustrator and scientist, she says, she worked hard to not only portray emotions in the animals (how would a shrimp smile?) as a way to illustrate the story but also made sure the creatures were anatomically correct. The result is a children&#8217;s book filled with gorgeous and colorful drawings of an orphaned turtle, a mischievous shrimp, and a friendly octopus. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Castor Oil Rig Tales</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is being published by AzBukiVeri Press.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her most recent book collaboration, however, is with Paloma Medina, a queer Ph.D. candidate at UC Santa Cruz who works in a genetics lab studying the way sex chromosomes have evolved in different animals. Funded through the Norris Center For Natural History&#8217;s art and science residency program along with local arts grants and a Kickstarter campaign, the book tells a more scientifically accurate tale of a widowed clownfish than what was shown in the iconic film, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding Nemo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kendall-Bar says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nemo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nervous male clownfish looks after his son following the apparent death of his wife. But, in the wild, when the dominant female clownfish dies, a male will transition to female to fill that role, Kendall-Bar says. Their book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking for Marla,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which Kendall-Bar illustrated, tells not only that story but also that of the once-male clownfish&#8217;s emotional transition into motherhood, she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired, also, by youth workshops through the Diversity Center of Santa Cruz, the book will have its launch party this fall, Kendall-Bar says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, she envisions a time when she can combine science with illustration into a lifelong career.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To be able to teach, do art and research, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like,&#8221; she says. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="022437508072701734bebd3c572534fc"><name>employee-appraisal-merit-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update: 2018-19 Employee Appraisal and Merit Program</title><summary>This communication provides updates on the UC Santa Cruz 2018-19 performance appraisal call for all staff and the merit program for policy-covered employees.</summary><start-date>1563260400000</start-date><display-name>Employee Appraisal and Merit Program</display-name><path>/2019/07/employee-appraisal-merit-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/07/employee-appraisal-merit-program</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1563404022798</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1563404045208</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>This communication provides updates on the UC Santa Cruz 2018-19 performance appraisal call for all staff and the merit program for policy-covered employees.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Call for Performance Appraisals</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The performance cycle runs from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Appraisals for policy covered staff must be completed by Friday, July 26, 2019.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Appraisals for represented staff are due Friday, August 30, 2019.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The purpose of performance management is to effectively engage teams in the mission of the university. The key to effective performance management involves a few basic elements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Crafting goals that are specific, important (mission-based) and measurable.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Frequent and candid feedback to all team members about their performance.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Coaching and support for staff to enable them to achieve their goals.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When goals are well formed and feedback is occurring frequently, the annual performance appraisals become a time to summarize communications that have been occurring throughout the year. It is expected that all employees have an appraisal every year and is required as part of the annual pay for performance cycle.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Online Appraisal Form</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The online form </span><span>is an interim tool for the campus to use until the implementation of the ePerformance module of UCPath. We expect to have the new system for next year&#8217;s appraisal process.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Please note: </span><strong>All staff (represented and policy covered) </strong>should be appraised using the online form.&#160;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Managers and supervisors are encouraged to keep appraisals succinct. It is not necessary to report each and every detail of performance. The appraisal is a summary of performance of key expectations including goals and core job responsibilities. It should focus on the impact of performance with a few examples and explanation of the overall rating.</span></p>

<p>I am happy to announce that P.K. Agarwal will join us as UC Santa Cruz's new dean of University Extension, effective Aug. 1.</p>
<p>Chancellor Cynthia Larive and I are thrilled to add such an accomplished executive to our team at UC Santa Cruz. P.K. has had a distinguished career in high tech spanning the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. He is a national leader in academics and technology. Most recently, he was founding CEO and dean of Northeastern University Silicon Valley, a satellite campus of the Boston institution. In three years, he grew the program to 750 students, launching new programs and working with major employers throughout the region while also stressing diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Before joining Northeastern, he was CEO of TiE Global, a multinational nonprofit dedicated to the growth of entrepreneurship, with 13,000 members in 61 cities in 18 countries. Prior to TiE, he was appointed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the first director of the Department of Technology Services for the state of California.</p>
<p>UCSC Silicon Valley Extension serves about 15,000 students annually, providing more than three-dozen extension courses and certificate programs that allow those in the workplace to advance their professional skills. In addition, UNEX facilitates valuable collaborative programs between our Santa Cruz campus and Silicon Valley businesses. It is also home to Smarter Balanced, which designs and administers standardized assessments for roughly 7 million K-12 students, as well as UC Scout, which ensures every student in the state can take courses needed for college admissions by offering online college preparation and Advanced Placement courses.</p>
<p>I am deeply grateful to Therese Ammiro, assistant UNEX dean and director of our Information Communications Technologies Division, for her work and leadership as interim dean of UNEX since the retirement of Lynda M. Rogers last spring.</p>
<p>I also would like to thank members of the UNEX dean search committee, chaired by University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell. The committee brought forth an exceptionally talented pool of finalists, and I am extremely appreciative of their work.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community </audience><admin>Interim CP/EVC Lori Kletzer</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="07069c768072701734bebd3cd3d3e3c9"><name>lunar-laser-ranging</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lick Observatory commemorates Apollo 11 experiment on 50th anniversary</title><summary>Dedication of a plaque at Lick's Shane Telescope on August 1 honors the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment that measured the distance to the moon 50 years ago.</summary><keywords>Joseph Wampler, Elinor Gates</keywords><start-date>1563804000000</start-date><display-name>Lick Observatory commemorates Apollo 11 experiment on 50th anniversary</display-name><path>/2019/07/lunar-laser-ranging</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/07/lunar-laser-ranging</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1563485968707</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1563985102208</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/07/images/moon-landing-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/07/images/moon-landing-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moon-landing-450.jpg</name><display-name>moon-landing-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>138118</file-size><width>450</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>lunar module and astronaut on moon</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/07/images/moon-landing-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/07/images/moon-landing-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moon-landing-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>moon-landing-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21216</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>lunar module and astronaut on moon</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The retro-reflector array can be seen in this NASA photo in front of the lunar module, between the flag and the astronaut, who is placing a seismograph on the lunar surface.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/07/images/shane-telescope-lh-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/07/images/shane-telescope-lh-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>shane-telescope-lh-400.jpg</name><display-name>shane-telescope-lh-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>146296</file-size><width>400</width><height>609</height></image><image-alt>Shane Telescope</image-alt><image-caption>The Shane Telescope at Lick Observatory was used to fire a powerful laser at the moon and detect the signal returned from the retro-reflector array placed on the lunar surface by the Apollo 11 astronauts.

<p>To commemorate this achievement on its 50th anniversary, a bronze plaque in the lobby of the Shane Telescope Dome at Lick Observatory will be dedicated on Thursday, August 1, as part of the <a href="https://ethw.org/Milestones:IEEE_Milestones_Program">IEEE Milestones Program</a>, which honors significant technical achievements and innovations in electronics and computing. (The event is by invitation only due to space limitations.)</p>
<p>Researchers used Lick's 120-inch Shane Telescope to fire a powerful laser at the moon and detect the light that bounced back from a retro-reflector array placed on the lunar surface by the Apollo 11 astronauts. By precisely timing the delay between short pulses of light from the laser and the return signals from the moon, the researchers were able calculate the distance with unprecedented accuracy.</p>
<p>By the time a laser pulse reached the moon, its light was spread out over an area about 2 miles in diameter, so the amount of light that came back to the telescope from the small (18 by 18 inches) reflector array was just a few photons.</p>
<p>"It was a big technological feat to detect such a small signal," said Elinor Gates, staff astronomer at Lick Observatory. "At the time, our Shane Telescope was the second largest in the world, and that gave Lick an advantage for detecting the signal."</p>
<p>Joseph Wampler, now a professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, coordinated the experiment for Lick Observatory. The team at Lick overcame numerous technological challenges to get the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment (LURE) to work. Wampler recalled that the agreement with NASA to use the Lick facilities happened in February 1969, leaving little time to prepare before the Apollo 11 mission in July.</p>
<p>"The optical system coupling the telescope to the lasers had to be designed and built, a system for guiding the telescope using a TV camera was also needed, optical benches for the lasers had to be cleared through the Defense Department before they could be purchased, and finally, the dome housing the Shane Telescope required substantial modification," he said.</p>
<p>To accommodate the lasers, their optical benches, and the telescope guiding system, a pit was dug below the Shane Telescope and lined with tile. The tiled pit is still there, known to Lick astronomers as "the swimming pool." Parts of the mirror system for directing the laser beams are also still installed on the telescope.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple teams</strong></p>
<p>According to Wampler, NASA was worried that when the Apollo astronauts left the moon, their rocket exhaust would leave the retro-reflector array covered with dust. Therefore, several teams were funded to try to detect it during the few hours that the astronauts remained on the moon after deploying the array. Two teams using different laser systems were working at Lick Observatory, and other teams were working at the McDonald Observatory in Texas and the Mount Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii. It soon became apparent that Soviet scientists were also trying to hit the LURE target with their own laser.</p>
<p>The initial attempts were frustrated by a number of problems, including the moon's position low on the horizon. Also, the high-powered ruby-crystal laser systems were prone to catastrophic equipment failures, complete with explosions and fried electronics. The first successful signal detection was achieved on August 1 using a KORAD laser system. Just a few days earlier, an equipment failure had sent Hal Walker, KORAD's field operations manager for the project, driving 350 miles from Mt. Hamilton to KORAD's labs in Santa Monica to get replacement parts.</p>
<p>Gates, who will lead a tour of the Shane Telescope after the dedication of the plaque, said the LURE experiment was one of the first pieces of history she learned about when she started working at Lick Observatory 20 years ago. "Lick's successful part in the Apollo 11 mission is a point of pride, even for those of us who are too young to remember the moon landing," she said.</p>
<p>At Lick, the laser ranging activities ended in August 1969, but observations have continued at other observatories, and subsequent Apollo missions (14 and 15) deployed additional retro-reflector arrays on the moon. LURE is the only Apollo experiment that is still returning data from the moon.</p>
<p>In addition to the first precise measurements of the distance to the moon, these experiments have provided important information about the moon's orbit and variations in its rotation, as well as improving our knowledge of continental drift, changes in the Earth's rotation rate, and the precession of its spin axis.</p>
<p>After the plaque dedication, a reception and talks will be held in Santa Clara, where Michael Bolte, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and former director of UC Observatories, will discuss Lick Observatory's role. Hal Walker will talk about his role in the experiment in a conversation with Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute.</p>
<p>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) History Center administers the IEEE Milestones Program. In addition to the plaque at Lick Observatory, the program will install a pedestal-mounted plaque in Santa Monica at the site where KORAD Lasers developed the ruby-crystal laser that was successfully used at Lick.</p>

In admitting students, the campus carefully assessed how to provide access to a high-quality and affordable UC education.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz increased the number of California students admitted from low-income families, underrepresented groups, and those who will be the first in their family to earn a 4-year degree. More than 9,500 first-generation college students from California were admitted this year, and 8,722 of the admitted students are from low-income families. The numbers are the highest they've been in three years.</p>
<p>The number of admitted Chicano/Latino students from California increased to 7,190 students, 667 more than the previous year. Other underrepresented groups remained steady with the campus admitting 1,096 African American students and 151 American Indian students.</p>
<p>The campus also continued its statewide effort to increase interest and applications from transfer students who are seeking a four-year degree. Supporting access for California community college students is one way to help diversify applicant pools and further enhance access to higher education. UCSC expects to again enroll one California transfer student for every two California first-year students and is <a href="http://apply.universityofcalifornia.edu/">accepting applications</a> for winter 2020 transfer throughout July. For fall, UC Santa Cruz admitted 6,331 California transfer students, a ten percent decline over 2018, but still an 18 percent increase over 2017.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz also continued its efforts to recruit and admit students from other parts of the United States and other countries, in support of its goal to increase geographic and cultural diversity. The campus admitted 3,008 first-year students from other parts of the country, a small increase over the previous year, and 5,708 students from other countries, an 8 percent increase from 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is excited to welcome this new cohort of first year and transfer students and proud that students are choosing to further their education at our campus,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia K. Larive. &#8220;UCSC is committed to admitting students with the background and potential to succeed and to providing support to help all students achieve their potential, especially those who will be the first in their family to earn a four-year degree.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Gearing up for fall</h3>
<p>One of the areas attracting attention from admitted students is the new major in environmental sciences. Already, the campus admitted 460 first-year students and 18 transfer students with environmental sciences as their intended major. The interdepartmental major underscores the campus commitment to sustainability and social justice and will prepare students who want to work in support of the environment. Graduates of the program will be prepared for employment in environmental consulting, industry compliance, and government agencies, as well as to seek advanced degrees in a wide range of fields.</p>
<p>The support for new students begins before the fall as many new students will start their studies in either the <a href="https://summer.ucsc.edu/summer-academies/index.html">First Year Academy or the Transfer Academy,</a> both opening on July 23. These programs help students transition into university life and succeed in their academic career. The academies give incoming students the opportunity to get ahead and start earning credits by taking summer classes; connecting with peers, faculty and staff; and building confidence utilizing campus resources.</p>
<p>Incoming students will also participate in a robust <a href="https://orientation.ucsc.edu/fall/index.html">Welcome Week</a> that includes college and major orientations, a festival on the East Field, tours, and much more. The week will culminate on Sept. 27 with a revival of the convocation tradition for new students combined with the investiture ceremony for Chancellor Larive. The event will be a moment to celebrate incoming students and all they have accomplished and to highlight a campus community that is ready to support them throughout the next phase of their journey.<br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1bdb65138072701734bebd3c047345fc"><name>in-memoriam-hauskins</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Stephen Hauskins</title><summary>Stephen Hauskins, UCSC Information Technology Services (ITS) staff member, passed away peacefully at Dominican Hospital on July 14, 2019. </summary><start-date>1563778800000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam</display-name><path>/2019/07/in-memoriam-hauskins</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/07/in-memoriam-hauskins</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1563835458014</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1563836944196</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/07/images/hauskins-300px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/07/images/hauskins-300px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hauskins-300px.jpg</name><display-name>hauskins-300px.jpg</display-name><file-size>37339</file-size><width>300</width><height>367</height></image><image-alt>Stephen Hauskins</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Hauskins, UCSC Information Technology Services (ITS) staff member, passed away peacefully at Dominican Hospital on July 14, 2019.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen was born in Glendale California to Hal Hauskins of Peoria, Illinois, and Margaret Megan Jones of Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, UK. He was raised in the small town of Holtville California. There, he was captivated by the night sky, and this opened up a world of wonder and amazement. As a boy, Astronomy, space exploration and Science in general, fueled his passion.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen earned his Bachelor's Degree in Physics from UC Davis. He moved to Boston for a while and worked at MIT. One of his fondest memories are of working alongside Richard Feynman at MIT. Stephen was most impressed by how such a prominent figure was so approachable and inclusive---a lasting impression.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more than 25 years, Stephen was employed at UCSC, first as Instructional Technology (IT) Systems Manager for Math, Biology and Environmental Toxicology and later as the Computing Director for the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences where he oversaw the development and delivery of IT services to support the research enterprise and represented the division in IT governance. Stephen distinguished himself through his contribution to the growing cyberinfrastructure and high performance computing services on campus, where he was the driving force behind the ongoing development and support of Hummingbird, UCSC&#8217;s open-access computational cluster, recently recognized in the </span><a href="https://cio.ucop.edu/hummingbird-ucscs-small-but-mighty-open-access-computational-cluster/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCIT systemwide blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Stephen was deeply committed to advancing the university&#8217;s research mission. He was a complex problem solver with an innate curiosity and extraordinary work ethic. He was generous with his time, knowledge and expertise and leaves behind many friends and colleagues who will miss his friendship and guidance and with whom he enjoyed working at UCSC.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to his job, Steve loved working and spending time in his garden. He had a great respect and love of all animals and was especially fond of his two cats; Gracie and Midnight. He is survived by his loving partner of 33 years, Jose Sanchez of Santa Cruz and extended family in Merced, CA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In lieu of flowers, his family asks that donations be made to some of his favorite charities: Save The Children, SPCA of Santa Cruz or ASPCA, and Native Animal Rescue of Santa Cruz.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

<p>Coauthors Nameera Akhtar, professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Vikram Jaswal, associate professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, put forth the provocative ideas in their paper, "<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/being-versus-appearing-socially-uninterested-challenging-assumptions-about-social-motivation-in-autism/4E75B5E49CC0061E65A4D78552482AF9">Being vs. Appearing Socially Uninterested: Challenging Assumptions about Social Motivation in Autism</a>." The article appears in <em>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</em>, which publishes in an innovative format known as "open peer commentary." The journal specializes in "particularly significant and controversial pieces of work," which the editors publish with commentaries on each article from specialists within and across disciplines, as well as the authors' response to the input. Free online access to the paper is <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/being-versus-appearing-socially-uninterested-challenging-assumptions-about-social-motivation-in-autism/4E75B5E49CC0061E65A4D78552482AF9/share/d0b34732e720928336a3e6950bf7ff7a8566467f">available here</a>.</p>
<p>Akhtar and Jaswal welcomed the engagement from scholars, nearly all of whom endorsed their approach, which drew heavily on "testimonies" from people with autism.</p>
<p>"This work began with questions about the widespread assumptions people make about how much&#8212;or how little&#8212;autistic people want to interact with others," said Akhtar. "We explored those questions by turning to what people with autism say about themselves."</p>
<p>According to some autistic people, low eye contact can help them focus their attention, thereby actually enhancing social engagement, said Akhtar. Similarly, repeating phrases&#8212;even though the meaning may not be immediately obvious to others&#8212;may also be a behavior designed to connect with others. Repetitive movements may simply be comforting, she noted.</p>
<p>"When you ask autistic people about these behaviors, their answers shed new light on the range of desire autistics have for social connection, and they express frustration that their behavior is misinterpreted," said Akhtar. "The familiar stereotypes about social aversion do autistic people a great injustice."</p>
<p>The following excerpts are among the published "testimonies" from autistics that Akhtar and Jaswal cited in their paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>"You might have been told that people with autism do not want social or romantic relationships, but this is a myth. While it is true that many of us struggle to create or maintain them, this does not mean that we do not want them." --from <em>An Adult with an Autism Diagnosis</em><em></em><em></em></li>
<li>"I can&#8217;t believe that anyone born as a human being really wants to be left all on their own&#8230; The truth is, we&#8217;d love to be with other people. But because things never, ever go right, we end up getting used to being alone &#8230; Whenever I overhear someone remark how much I prefer being on my own, it makes me feel desperately lonely." --from <em>The Reason I Jump</em>&#160;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Once I meet people or when I know I will meet people who know me only through my writings, my anxiety level is so high, I can act in very strange ways. I can look very childish and silly and I am very self-conscious about this. I can also seem uninterested, but this is only a self-preservation mask. I find it hard to communicate even if I have a lot of things I want to say." --from <em>Loud hands: Autistic People, Speaking</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Other scholars were generally enthusiastic about Akhtar and Jaswal's approach, and there was widespread agreement that autistic testimony is an essential and surprisingly underused resource to understand social motivation in autism. There was some concern about minimizing important differences in autistic cognition and social motivation, which the authors clarified was not their intention. Many commenters called for a more systematic study of autistic perspectives regarding social engagement, which the authors endorsed.</p>
<p>Akhtar and Jaswal particularly appreciated input from a number of autistic scholars who commented on their work. Leaders of the disability rights movement say, "Nothing about us without us," which Jaswal said makes it particularly gratifying to hear from autistic people at this stage of the research.</p>
<p>"If we want to reduce the social isolation experienced by many autistics, the next step is for both autistic and non-autistic people to learn more about each other's social goals and social signals," said Jaswal. "That's the path to greater understanding and greater inclusion."</p>

<p>She is one of 76 new fellows to be elected this year, joining a community of more than 1,400 scholars who currently make up the UK&#8217;s national academy for the humanities and social sciences.</p>
<p>Current fellows of the academy include classicist Dame Mary Beard, historian Sir Simon Schama and philosopher Baroness Onora O&#8217;Neill, along with historic fellows such as Dame Frances Yates, Sir Winston Churchill, Baroness Mary Warnock, C.S Lewis, Seamus Heaney and Beatrice Webb.</p>
<p>The British Academy is a funding body for research, nationally and internationally, as well as a forum for debate and engagement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The British Academy has always recognized pioneering research in the humanities and social sciences, and 2019 is no exception,&#8221; noted Professor Sir David Cannadine, the academy president. &#8220;This year we have elected a particularly multi-skilled and versatile cohort of Fellows whose research crosses conventional academic boundaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it is climate conservation or the aging society, the rise of artificial intelligence or social cohesion, our new Fellows&#8217; wealth of expertise means the Academy is exceptionally well-placed to provide new knowledge and insights on the challenges of today. Their work has opened rich new seams of understanding and discovery, offering new perspectives on long-standing and emerging challenges alike,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Haraway received her Ph.D. in Biology from Yale in 1972. Her research and teaching focuses on science and technology studies, feminist theory, and multispecies studies. She has served as thesis adviser for over 60 doctoral students in several disciplinary and interdisciplinary areas. She is also an active participant in the Science and Justice Research Center and the Center for Creative Ecologies at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>With attention to the intersection of biology with culture and politics, Haraway explores the web of science fact, science fiction, speculative feminism, speculative fabulation, science and technology studies, and the multispecies world.&#160;</p>
<p>Her books include <em>Staying with the Trouble</em>: <em>Making Kin in the Chthulucene</em>; <em>Manifestly Haraway</em> (2016); <em>When Species Meet</em> (2008); <em>The Companion Species Manifesto</em> (2003); <em>The Haraway Reader</em> (2004); Modest<em>_Witness@Second_Millennium</em> (1997, 2nd edition 2018); <em>Simians, Cyborgs, and Women </em>(1991); <em>Primate Visions </em>(1989); and <em>Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields</em> (1976, 2004).</p>
<p>A feature-length film made by Fabrizio Terravova, titled <em>Donna Haraway: Story Telling for Earthly Survival</em>, was released in 2016, and is available as a DVD. She is also the co-editor of <em>Making Kin Not Population</em> with Adele Clarke (Prickly Paradigm Press, 2018), which addresses questions of human numbers, feminist anti-racist reproductive and environmental justice, and multispecies flourishing.</p>

One of the top academic experts on Honduras in the United States, she tells the dramatic story of life in that country after the military coup that ousted President Manuel Zelaya in June 2009.</p>
<p>Told in part through first-person experiences, interwoven with lucid political analysis, it is a story about the repressive regime that was launched with the coup, the ways in which U.S. policy has continued to support that regime, and the Honduran resistance movement that is growing with help from a new solidarity movement in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;The book is about one-third my personal stories of what I witnessed, and was eventually involved in, during the nine years following the coup that deposed the democratically-elected president of Honduras.,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;It's not just a horror story, though. It deliberately tries to balance the story of repression with the joys and commitments of the Honduran resistance, and how Hondurans continue to seize life amidst terror.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The book is very deliberately transnational--crossing back and forth between Honduras and Washington D.C.,&#8221; Frank added. &#8220;And it very deliberately counters the mainstream media narrative about Honduras, which casts Hondurans as merely suffering victims with no political movements or opinions.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tracking U.S. policy</strong> as it developed year by year after the coup, the book shows how that policy has been instrumental in supporting a brutal regime for a decade and helping to create some of our most pressing problems today--including the so-called border crisis. By 2012, Honduras had the highest homicide rate in the world with 86 murders per 100,000 residents. The victims have included journalists, union leaders, human rights defenders, as well as leaders of poor farming communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Trump and his allies have called it a border &#8216;crisis&#8217; to fan the flames of racism and immigrant-bashing,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;But for Hondurans, and other Central Americans, the crisis in their own countries is very real. Mainstream media coverage tells us that Hondurans are fleeing &#8216;violence and poverty&#8217; but misses the glaring fact that the violence and poverty are the direct result of U.S. policy--which has been, and remains, providing support for the vicious post-coup regime, and especially the dictatorship of Juan Orlando Hern&#225;ndez.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;U.S. funds continue to shore up his police and military, which continue to use live bullets to kill peaceful protesters,&#8221; she added. &#8220;And a great range of growing evidence documents that the Honduran military, police, and president are involved in drug trafficking--yet the U.S. continues to celebrate its partnership with Honduras in fighting drug trafficking!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Frank has been commenting</strong> on the volatile situation in the region since the 2009 military coup for media ranging from the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Washington Post to National Public Radio</em>, and the <em>Associated Press</em>. She has consistently questioned U.S. foreign policy toward Honduras in an effort to stop the administration from supporting, funding, and perpetuating human rights abuses.</p>
<p>She has also testified in Congress about Honduras, as well as in the California State Assembly about the treatment of refugees from Central America.</p>
<p>In a 2013 appearance before the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission in the U.S. House of Representatives, Frank began her testimony by noting:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I have been asked to address U.S. policy in Honduras, and that will be the focus of my statement here today&#8230;Before doing so I would like to reiterate the enormity and breadth of the human rights crisis the other speakers have identified.</em></p>
<p><em>I just returned from Honduras yesterday. When I arrived a few days before, I spoke with a young father in his early 30s. He is not particularly involved politically, but quite well-informed. When I told him I was going to testify in the U.S. Congress about human rights in Honduras, he volunteered--without any further words on my part:&#160;'There are no human rights in Honduras.&#160;&#8216;They don&#8217;t exist.&#8217;&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em><strong>Frank has spent </strong>the last few months doing numerous interviews for her new book in a variety of media venues, while still being tapped by reporters from major news outlets for comments on current events such as the recent migrant caravans.</p>
<p>&#8220;When journalists contact me, it's usually about breaking news&#8212;such as when the Honduran dictator, Juan Orlando Hern&#225;ndez, stole the 2017 presidential election and turned the police and military on protesters,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;In other cases, it's investigative journalists, who are looking for insights into a specific dynamic, as when the <em>Associated Press</em> documented that the National Director of Police had been moving cocaine.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she also continues to travel to Honduras and Washington D.C. in her decade-long effort to help change U.S. policy toward Honduras. And her message is loud and clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. should immediately suspend all security aid to Honduras, and stop treating the narco-dictatorship as a friendly partner,&#8221; said Frank.&#160; "&#8217;Humanitarian&#8217; or &#8216;development&#8217; aid should be carefully evaluated too. USAID funds have a long history of being used to create and nurture fake &#8216;civil society&#8217; groups loyal to the U.S. and designed to serve U.S. interests. Agricultural &#8216;aid&#8217; has long been used to create export and import dependencies.&#160; All this aid is called &#8216;soft power&#8217; for a reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need, instead, to listen to what the independent social movements and human rights groups in Honduras have to say--to their own ideas about democracy, free and fair elections, and social justice--rather than deploy new forms of imperialism in the name of &#8216;helping&#8217; poor victims.&#8221;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>If your computer is managed by ITS through BigFix and your machine is running Windows 7, you will be contacted by an ITS technician before January to upgrade your system. You can check if you have BigFix by the blue circle icon next to your computer's system clock.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If your computer isn&#8217;t managed by ITS and your machine is running Windows 7, we highly recommend upgrading sooner rather than waiting until the last minute. When a vendor ends support, it can lead to security vulnerabilities, software incompatibility, compliance issues, and poor computer performance and reliability. Vulnerable systems may be removed from the network. It&#8217;s important that your computer is always kept up to date with the latest supported software and operating system.</span></p>

Nauenberg was born in Berlin, Germany, on December 19, 1934. He emigrated with his parents and siblings to Barranquilla, Colombia, in 1939 to escape persecution during World War II. When he moved to the United States, he studied physics as an undergraduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and went on to obtain his Ph.D. at Cornell University under the mentorship of the legendary physicist Hans Bethe. After a postdoctoral position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, Nauenberg was hired as an assistant professor at Columbia University. There he wrote one of the classic papers in quantum field theory with Tsung-Dao Lee. Their results, introduced independently by Toichiro Kinoshita, became known as the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg Theorem.</span></p>
<p class="western"><a name="__DdeLink__320_1325031665"></a> <span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Nauenberg came to UC Santa Cruz in 1966 as one of the pioneer members of the UCSC faculty. He played a crucial role in the development of the Physics Department in its early days, hiring a number of its members and helping to establish the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP). He encouraged the activities of a group of young researchers developing what has become known as Chaos Theory, and more generally pushed the department towards excellence in novel and established fields. Among his other contributions to the campus, Nauenberg was instrumental in developing both Stevenson and Crown Colleges, he served as the chair of the Physics Department from 1970 to 1972 and 1983 to 1985, and he played an important role in initiating the graduate physics program.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">When Nauenberg retired in 1994, he saw it as an opportunity to continue his influential research in physics and pursue his long-standing passion for the history of science, focusing on the work of Isaac Newton, Robert Hooke, and others. In 2013, he was honored with the Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award in recognition of his academic achievements as an emeritus. Nauenberg also remained actively engaged in the campus as part of his deep commitment to advance academic excellence at UC Santa Cruz. He served as the Emeriti Faculty President in 1998 and 2015, and he followed developments in the physics department and the university at large throughout his life. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">He is survived by his wife, Josette Nauenberg, his siblings, Eva Faillace, Uriel Nauenberg, and Lucrecia Sachs, his children, Peter Nauenberg, Maria Neumann, Tanya Nauenberg-Blakeslee, Sander Nauenberg, and Saskia Nauenberg Dunkell, and his many beloved grandchildren.&#160;</span><span><span color="#000000"

These technologies can collect huge amounts of data, however, and conservation biologists are increasingly turning to the tools of artificial intelligence (AI) to sort through it all. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In particular, a machine learning method called "deep learning," already widely used in face recognition and other image- and speech-recognition applications, is now being applied by conservation biologists to analyze images, videos, and sound recordings of everything from African elephants to aquatic insects. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Biologists Donald Croll and Bernie Tershy, who run the </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://ccal.ucsc.edu/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Conservation Action Lab</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> at UC Santa Cruz, have been using deep learning in their work on seabird conservation. They began developing acoustic technologies for monitoring seabird populations as a research project and eventually started a company, </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="http://conservationmetrics.com/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Conservation Metrics</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, to provide wildlife monitoring services. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"We want to increase the efficiency of conservation monitoring," said Croll, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. "We do these conservation interventions, like removing invasive species from an island, but ongoing monitoring to track how seabird populations recover after the intervention is expensive. AI tools can help us automate that."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Automated acoustic sensors can record the sounds at a nesting site for weeks or months at a time. Then it's a matter of finding the calls made by the species of interest in thousands of hours of recordings. Initially, the researchers used traditional pattern-matching tools to analyze the acoustic data, but they found that machine learning offers a much more powerful approach.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"Our performance has vastly improved with the use of deep learning techniques," said co-founder Matthew McKown, who began working on the project as a postdoctoral researcher in Croll's lab and is now CEO of Conservation Metrics. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The company's acoustic monitoring projects include studies of forest elephants and rare bats in Africa, endangered marbled murrelets nesting in old-growth redwood forests, and even a project with researchers in Hawaii to detect collisions of birds with power lines for more accurate assessments of where and how often they occur. The company is also starting to expand beyond acoustic monitoring to image analysis, as in a project with Duke University researchers using drone images to count Olive Ridley sea turtles off their nesting beaches in Costa Rica.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The demand for these tools is growing rapidly, McKown said. "When we started, other than a few academic labs, we were the only people we knew of applying machine learning to conservation monitoring data. And now it's exploding."</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Long-term monitoring</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">At UC Santa Cruz, researchers are developing and applying techniques involving machine learning in a wide range of conservation-related projects. Peter Raimondi, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, is just beginning to assess the potential of AI to help with long-term monitoring of intertidal ecosystems. For nearly 30 years he has overseen intertidal surveys along the west coast of North America, from Baja to Alaska. The traditional approach involves teams of researchers doing repeated sampling at established sites where they painstakingly identify and count every species at points on a grid. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"The question that has always plagued researchers doing this kind of survey work is whether we're really capturing all the diversity when we're only sampling a fraction of the total area," Raimondi said. "Now we're starting to fly drones over these sites to capture aerial images, and then we'll see if we can train an algorithm to identify the species in those images."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The process starts with aerial images of sites already sampled by people on the ground. Those data are used to train a deep learning algorithm to identify species in the images. Large amounts of data are needed for this iterative training process, but if the algorithm is accurate enough, then drones can be used to survey much larger areas than can be practically surveyed by people on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"It has real potential," Raimondi said. "We have funding to do this in California, and we hope to do it for the whole west coast. We know the algorithms don't do well if you try to apply them too broadly, so we can't train it with data from the Central Coast and then take it to Oregon&#8212;you have to do local calibrations. So we'll always need people doing sampling on the ground, but we may be able to automate a lot of it."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Ross Davison, a graduate student in the Coastal Science &amp; Policy Program, is also using aerial images from drones and machine learning in his research on coastal wetlands. "The algorithms are pretty robust for mapping vegetation and water inundation," he said. "We're hoping to use it for everything from initial biomass assessments and species delineation, to eventually even plant health assessments." </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">As climate change drives changes in wetlands and other dynamic ecosystems, the ability to rapidly collect this kind of information will be increasingly important for developing effective management strategies, he said. The combination of aerial imaging and machine learning has the potential to save a lot of time and effort.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"It can take out a lot of the barriers to doing this type of analysis. That's what we're excited about," Davison said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">No silver bullet</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">McKown said he often gets asked by field biologists if he's trying to replace them with technology, but field work is still an essential part of the process. "You have to have people in the field to be able to interpret the results," he said. "This isn't a silver bullet. Like any tool, you have to understand how to incorporate it into your project. We always have a person in the loop, an analyst who is sampling from the computer's predictions to understand how it's performing."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The range of potential applications is constantly expanding. Andrew Port, a computer engineering graduate student in Professor Roberto Manduchi's Computer Vision Lab in the Baskin School of Engineering, has been working with the conservation organization </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="http://www.rare.org/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Rare</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> on a sustainable fisheries project in Central America. There, the challenge is to certify the origins of fish to ensure that they were caught in accordance with agreements designed to protect certain areas. The fishermen say they can tell where a fish was caught just by looking at it, and research has shown that some species do have slight variations in shape depending on what area of the reef they come from. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"The problem then was to develop an automated system, like a cell phone app, that's as good as the intuition of the fishermen," Port said. "Newer models of cell phones have chips designed to do these kinds of calculations. What's driving all this are huge advances in computer vision and machine learning."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Port is also working with Nicholas Macias, a UCSC graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology, who is deploying a camera system in streams to monitor insects drifting downstream. The goal is to measure the availability of prey for fish and how it changes over time. The system can acquire 30,000 images in an hour, just the kind of data analysis challenge that AI can help with.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"He developed a really effective method of photographing the insects that float through the stream," Port said. "I've been working with him to develop a deep-learning model that can differentiate between different kinds of insects in the photos."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Port's work in Manduchi's lab has focused on assistive technologies for people with visual impairments. His connection with Rare came through Vikram Sahai, a UCSC Foundation trustee who worked at Google for 15 years.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"I left with the idea of doing these kinds of fun projects where I can use my background in big data and machine learning to help conservation organizations," Sahai said. "Often the practitioners in the field don't know what technology can do for them, and I don't know what problems they need to solve."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">After meeting the CEO of Rare, Sahai visited their offices to learn about their work and identified some projects that might benefit from technological innovations. He said he always looks for opportunities to get UCSC students involved. "One thing about UCSC is the students are very aware of environmental challenges, and they want to work on meaningful projects," Sahai said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sahai is also an adviser for </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://wildlifeinsights.org/home-0"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Wildlife Insights</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, a new platform for processing images from wildlife camera traps developed by a partnership involving Google, Conservation International, and other organizations. Microsoft's </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth?activetab=pivot1%3Aprimaryr6"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">AI for Earth</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> is a similar program that is working to put cloud services and AI tools in the hands of those working to solve global environmental challenges. (Conservation Metrics is among the groups funded by AI for Earth.) </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"In the conservation space, what's happened is the cost of cameras is coming down, and with deep learning we're better at processing images and videos, so it's now become relatively cheap to deploy large numbers of camera traps or video cameras and process the data by machine learning," Sahai explained. "Conservationists collect all these images, but to go through and analyze it all is very time consuming. Now we can automate the processing, and all this data can be in the cloud, which really enables them to share it with other researchers and disseminate results." </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">McKown said he is excited to see so much innovation in this area. "It's great to see, and I'm excited to learn from how other people are approaching these same questions," he said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">At UC Santa Cruz, researchers are also applying AI tools in fields ranging from astronomy to genomics. But Port said he's been struck by the level of interest from ecologists. "I've noticed a real demand from the ecology community, because they have so many monitoring tasks, and these models are perfect for that," he said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Xavier Prochaska, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics, has co-founded a campus-wide Applied Artificial Intelligence Initiative to bring together faculty and students engaged in AI across all the divisions. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"A key goal is to get faculty talking across disciplines and sharing ideas," Prochaska said. "We started a seminar series and offer tutorials for students. Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, and building an interdisciplinary community will help us stay on the cutting edge of this."</span></p>
