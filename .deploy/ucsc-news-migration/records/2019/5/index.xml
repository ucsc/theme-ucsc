Powerful techniques developed in recent decades enable scientists to study living cells in unprecedented detail, and new techniques continue to push the limits of light microscopes.</p>
<p>Sara Abrahamsson, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz, is at the forefront of innovations in optical microscopy. She invented a technique called aberration-corrected multi-focus microscopy (MFM), which enables 3-dimensional imaging of living cells. More recently (in 2017), she showed that MFM can be combined with another technique, called structured illumination microscopy (SIM), that provides "super-resolution" beyond the classical limits of light microscopes.</p>
<p>Now, Abrahamsson is working with UCSC biologists to build and test the first multi-focus structured illumination microscope.</p>
<p>"The 2017 paper was a proof-of-concept study. Now we want to build the microscope and show that it works for 3-D imaging of living cells with super-resolution," said Abrahamsson, who won a $700,000 major research instrumentation grant from the National Science Foundation to fund the project.</p>
<p>Her collaborators in the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental (MCD) Biology are thrilled to be working with Abrahamsson. "Sara is a uniquely talented inventor of microscopes," said Grant Hartzog, professor of MCD biology.</p>
<p>Hartzog is one of several UCSC biologists who will be using Abrahamsson's optical technology to study chromatin (the complex of DNA, RNA, and proteins that forms chromosomes) in the cells of various organisms. He explained that Abrahamsson's MFM technique improves on the widely used technology of confocal microscopy. A confocal microscope blocks out-of-focus light to obtain sharp images of thin sections at different depths in a sample.</p>
<p>"You can take multiple slices and build up a 3-D image. The problem is the time that elapses between each image when you're taking multiple slices of a living cell. Because the components of the cell are in constant motion, the resulting image is blurry," Hartzog said. "Sara figured out how to focus the light so you can collect all the slices in one shot for an instant 3-D image. That's really important for imaging living cells."</p>
<p><strong>UCSC Microscopy Center</strong></p>
<p>Abrahamsson's lab has already built one multi-focus microscope and installed it in the UCSC Life Sciences Microscopy Center, where Hartzog and others have started using it and optimizing their techniques. A SIM system currently under construction will add super-resolution capabilities to the multi-focus microscope.</p>
<p>Super-resolution is important because the dimensions of the structures of interest to the biologists are so small. The resolution of a light microscope is limited by the wavelengths of visible light to about 200 nanometers. Chromatin structures are much smaller than that, on the order of 10 to 30 nanometers in diameter.</p>
<p>But scientists have developed ways to get past the classical limits of optical microscopy. Structured illumination microscopy is one of several super-resolution techniques that have been developed, with the first practical implementations appearing in the 1990s. By combining multi-focus and structured illumination microscopy, Abrahamsson's lab is pushing the technology to the limit in terms of both speed and spatial resolution.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Abrahamsson's graduate student Eduardo Hirata-Miyasaki has developed an extended version of MFM, called the M25, which increases the number of focal planes (or "slices") from nine to 25 and uses separate cameras to capture the images from each focal plane. This instrument does not have super-resolution capability, but is super-fast. It can record live 3-D volumes at more than 100 frames per second and is designed for functional imaging of living neural circuits of the brain and spinal cord.</p>
<p>"Thanks to the advances in CMOS sensor technology, we can improve the optical design of the MFM system to create a fast and sensitive method for live 3-D imaging," said Hirata, who presented the new system at a recent <a href="http://www.focusonmicroscopy.org/">Focus on Microscopy</a> conference in London.</p>
<p><strong>Custom-designed optics</strong></p>
<p>The MF-SIM microscope requires building and combining two highly specialized, custom-designed optical systems. Abrahamsson's team designs and fabricates their own optics components, using a nanofabrication facility at UC Santa Barbara to make the diffractive gratings needed for multi-focus microscopy.</p>
<p>Hirata explained that the diffractive gratings can be easily customized depending on the region of interest and the target depth of the sample. "The M25 images simultaneously at 25 different depths, and we can vary the separation between those focal planes. Having more focal planes allows us to image greater volumes with higher resolutions," he said.</p>
<p>The biologists working with Abrahamsson's lab are using a range of different organisms in their research. Hartzog and Hinrich Boeger study the effects of chromatin packaging on RNA transcription in yeast cells; Needhi Bhalla studies chromosome dynamics during cell division in <em>C. elegans</em> worms; and William Sullivan studies what happens to damaged chromosomes in fruit flies.</p>
<p>Abrahamsson did some of her early work at the Advanced Imaging Center at HHMI&#8217;s Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Virginia, and one of Sullivan's students went there last year to use their specialized systems. The results only reinforced the need for Abrahamsson's MF-SIM technology.</p>
<p>"We're looking at what happens when a chromosome is broken, which can lead to cancerous cells," said Sullivan, a professor of MCD biology. "We want to follow this in real time in three dimensions, but we haven't been able to do that. What Sara's doing is really pretty ground-breaking."</p>
<p>Having the microscopy experts here on campus makes a big difference, he added.</p>
<p>"There's always a lot of back and forth, the biologists talking to the engineers to figure out how to get the end result we want," Sullivan said. "Being able to just take our samples downstairs, instead of traveling to Janelia with live flies, we can make much faster progress."</p>
<p>Abrahamsson's expertise in optics is in high demand, and she is developing and teaching new courses in optics and microscopy for students at UC Santa Cruz. She is also starting a project with researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory working on a planned space probe. In all these projects, Abrahamsson is excited not only about the new technology, but also about what scientists will be able to learn with it.</p>
<p>"I can't wait to see my collaborators take the first data set of living cells on the MF-SIM that we are building. Who knows what they are going to be able to discover with it?" she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7468c1298072701734bebd3c61096846"><name>hubble-legacy-field</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomers assemble wide view of the evolving universe</title><summary>A team led by UC Santa Cruz astronomer Garth Illingworth used 16 years of Hubble Space Telescope observations to create a new portrait of the distant universe.</summary><keywords>Garth Illingworth, Hubble Space Telescope</keywords><start-date>1556805600000</start-date><display-name>Astronomers assemble wide view of the evolving universe</display-name><path>/2019/05/hubble-legacy-field</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/05/hubble-legacy-field</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1556731182581</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1556808577770</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ray Villard, STScI</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/hubble-galaxies-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/hubble-galaxies-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hubble-galaxies-500.jpg</name><display-name>hubble-galaxies-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>98620</file-size><width>500</width><height>404</height></image><image-alt>15 galaxy images</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/hubble-galaxies-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/hubble-galaxies-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hubble-galaxies-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>hubble-galaxies-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14736</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>galaxy image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>This graphic shows close-up images of 15 galaxies from the 265,000 galaxies in the Hubble Legacy Field.

<p>The deep-sky mosaic, created from nearly 7,500 individual exposures, provides a wide portrait of the distant universe, containing 265,000 galaxies that stretch back through 13.3 billion years of time to just 500 million years after the big bang. The faintest and farthest galaxies are just one ten-billionth the brightness of what the human eye can see.</p>
<p>The universe&#8217;s evolutionary history is chronicled in this one sweeping view. The portrait shows how galaxies have changed over time, building themselves up to become the giant galaxies seen in the nearby universe.</p>
<p>The ambitious endeavor, called the Hubble Legacy Field, combines observations taken by several Hubble deep-field surveys, including the eXtreme Deep Field (XDF), the deepest view of the universe. The wavelength range stretches from ultraviolet to near-infrared light, capturing all the features of galaxy assembly over time.</p>
<p>Garth Illingworth, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, led the team that assembled the new image. He also led previous deep-field surveys, including the XDF and the infrared Hubble Ultra Deep Field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that we have gone wider than in previous surveys, we are harvesting many more distant galaxies in the largest such dataset ever produced by Hubble,&#8221; Illingworth said. &#8220;This one image contains the full history of the growth of galaxies in the universe, from their times as &#8216;infants&#8217; to when they grew into fully-fledged &#8216;adults.&#8217; No image will surpass this one until future space telescopes are launched.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve put together this mosaic as a tool to be used by us and by other astronomers,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The expectation is that this survey will lead to an even more coherent, in-depth, and greater understanding of the universe&#8217;s evolution in the coming years.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Catalog of distant galaxies</strong></p>
<p>The image yields a huge catalog of distant galaxies. &#8220;Such exquisite high-resolution measurements of the numerous galaxies in this catalog enable a wide swath of extragalactic study,&#8221; said catalog lead researcher Katherine Whitaker of the University of Connecticut, in Storrs. &#8220;Often, these kinds of surveys have yielded unanticipated discoveries which have had the greatest impact on our understanding of galaxy evolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galaxies are the &#8220;markers of space,&#8221; as astronomer Edwin Hubble once described them a century ago. Galaxies allow astronomers to trace the expansion of the universe, offer clues to the underlying physics of the cosmos, show when the chemical elements originated, and enable the conditions that eventually led to the appearance of our solar system and life.</p>
<p>This wider view contains about 30 times as many galaxies as in the previous deep fields. The new portrait, a mosaic of multiple snapshots, covers almost the width of the full moon. The XDF, which penetrated deeper into space than this wider view, lies in this region, but it covers less than one-tenth of the full moon&#8217;s diameter.</p>
<p>The Legacy Field also uncovers a zoo of unusual objects. Many of them are the remnants of galactic &#8220;train wrecks,&#8221; a time in the early universe when small, young galaxies collided and merged with other galaxies.</p>
<p>Assembling all of the observations was an immense task. The image comprises the collective work of 31 Hubble programs by different teams of astronomers. Hubble has spent more time on this tiny area than on any other region of the sky, totaling more than 250 days, representing nearly three-quarters of a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal was to assemble all 16 years of exposures into a legacy image,&#8221; explained the team&#8217;s data processing lead Dan Magee, a programmer and data analyst at UC Santa Cruz and UC Observatories. &#8220;Previously, most of these exposures had not been put together in a consistent way that can be used by any researcher. Astronomers can select the data in the Legacy Field they want and work with it immediately, as opposed to having to perform a huge amount of data reduction before conducting scientific analysis.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Available worldwide</strong></p>
<p>The image, along with the individual exposures that make up the new view, is available to the worldwide astronomical community through the <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/">Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes</a> (MAST). MAST, an online database of astronomical data from Hubble and other NASA missions, is located at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has come a long way in taking ever deeper &#8220;core samples&#8221; of the distant universe. After Hubble&#8217;s launch in 1990, astronomers debated if it was worth spending a chunk of the telescope&#8217;s time to go on a &#8220;fishing expedition&#8221; to take a very long exposure of a small, seemingly blank piece of sky. The resulting Hubble Deep Field image in 1995 captured several thousand unseen galaxies in one pointing. The bold effort was a landmark demonstration and a defining proof-of-concept that set the stage for future deep field images. In 2002, Hubble&#8217;s Advanced Camera for Surveys went even deeper to uncover 10,000 galaxies in a single snapshot. Astronomers used exposures taken by Hubble&#8217;s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), installed in 2009, to assemble the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2012/09/extreme-deep-field.html">eXtreme Deep Field</a> snapshot in 2012. Unlike previous Hubble cameras, the telescope&#8217;s WFC3 covers a broader wavelength range, from ultraviolet to near-infrared.</p>
<p>This new Legacy Field image mosaic is the first in a series of Hubble Legacy Field images. The team is working on a second set of images, totaling more than 5,200 Hubble exposures, in another area of the sky. In the future, astronomers hope to broaden the multi-wavelength range in the legacy images to include longer-wavelength infrared data and high-energy X-ray observations from two other NASA Great Observatories, the Spitzer Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory.</p>
<p>The vast number of galaxies in the Legacy Field image are also prime targets for future telescopes.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will really set the stage for NASA&#8217;s planned Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST),&#8221; Illingworth said. &#8220;The Legacy Field is a pathfinder for WFIRST, which will capture an image that is 100 times larger than a typical Hubble photo. In just three weeks worth of observations by WFIRST, astronomers will be able to assemble a field that is much deeper and more than twice as large as the Hubble Legacy Field.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, NASA&#8217;s upcoming James Webb Space Telescope will allow astronomers to push much deeper into the legacy field to reveal how the infant galaxies actually grew. Webb&#8217;s infrared coverage will go beyond the limits of Hubble and Spitzer to help astronomers identify the first galaxies in the universe.</p>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and ESA (European Space Agency). NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the telescope.

<p>Michael Dine, distinguished professor of physics, and Susan Strome, distinguished professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, were elected to the NAS in recognition of their achievements in original research. They join 12 other UCSC faculty who are members of the academy.</p>
<p>Dine, a high-energy physicist affiliated with the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP), has made important contributions in the areas of theoretical particle physics, the phenomenology of fundamental particle interactions, and theories of new physics beyond the standard model. The standard model is a very successful theory explaining the interactions of elementary particles, yet it is known to be incomplete. The principle goal of Dine's research has been to address questions left unanswered by the standard model. His work also addresses big questions in cosmology, such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy.</p>
<p>Dine's work on supersymmetry helped open a rich field studying the dynamics of supersymmetric theories and yielded insights into aspects of string theory. He proposed models to account for the "hierarchy problem," also known as the "problem of large numbers," which relates to the widely disparate energy scales in nature.</p>
<p>A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Dine won the American Physical Society&#8217;s Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Physics in 2017 and received the Outstanding Faculty Award of the UCSC Division of Physical and Biological Sciences in 2011.</p>
<p>Strome is a leading authority on the development of germ cells, the cells that give rise to the sperm and eggs needed to create the next generation of organisms. She has also made important findings in the field of "epigenetics," which refers to DNA modifications that influence gene expression without changing the DNA sequences of genes.</p>
<p>Strome's research over the past 35 years has led to major advances in the understanding of how certain cells in the developing embryo become germ cells. She discovered "germ granules," distinctive structures that protect germ cell identity in the cells that carry them, and showed that germ granules are delivered to the embryo by the egg and then passed specifically to germ cells.</p>
<p>Her research on epigenetics has addressed questions raised by studies suggesting that environmental stresses can cause epigenetic changes in gene expression that are transmitted from parents to their children. Strome's lab has shown how epigenetic modifications can be passed from cell to cell during development and across generations from parent to offspring.</p>
<p>A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Strome received the Outstanding Faculty Award of the UCSC Division of Physical and Biological Sciences and the UCSC Presidential Chair Award, both in 2015.</p>
<p>The new members of the National Academy of Sciences will be formally inducted at the 2020 NAS Annual Meeting.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="79b40d108072701734bebd3c58bb5569"><name>summer-session</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Enrollment opens for UCSC Summer Session</title><summary>Open enrollment is underway for UC Santa Cruz Summer Session, which offers a wide range of classes and online courses across multiple departments.</summary><start-date>1556780400000</start-date><display-name>Summer Session</display-name><path>/2019/05/summer-session</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/05/summer-session</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1556820003312</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1556925266543</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edut</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/ucsc-summer-session-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/ucsc-summer-session-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ucsc-summer-session-500px.jpg</name><display-name>ucsc-summer-session-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>301813</file-size><width>500</width><height>500</height></image><image-alt>Mother and daughter on campus</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Extended again this year, UCSC staff and faculty get half off tuition to encourage professional and personal development.

Zoe Lofgren&#8217;s office and other members of the California delegation.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Growing up in a single-parent household, lively political discussions were not a part of everyday life for Davon Thomas.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother was too busy trying to pay rent every month,&#8221; Thomas said.</p>
<p>But as he matured in the shadow of the Capitol building in Sacramento, Thomas began to develop an affinity for politics, especially as he came to learn of the experiences of his grandmother and great uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I grew up around people who witnessed the Civil Rights movement, who marched in those marches,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The older generation of my family worked with the Black Panther party helping to distribute food to black folks and passing out lunches for young black students going to school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, it wasn&#8217;t until 2008, when Thomas witnessed the historic election of Barack Obama as the first black president of the United States, that he found his calling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama became the first black president and Kevin Johnson became the first black mayor of Sacramento,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was a beautiful moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Thomas is forging his own path through the political sphere, currently serving as the vice president of External Affairs for the Student Union Assembly.</p>
<p>The position entails a lot of advocacy work for the student body, not only at UC Santa Cruz, but throughout the UC system. Thomas, a third-year history major, travels to UC Regents meetings, presents student issues to UC Office of the President, travels to Sacramento to lobby California lawmakers on behalf of the student body, and has even led a delegation to Washington D.C. to help bring awareness of student issues to the federal level.</p>
<p>&#8220;We fight for basic needs,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;We are fighting against food insecurity, housing insecurity, and providing mental health resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>But one of the largest issues facing students continues to be the specter of rising tuition. In order to combat the increasing cost of a college education, Thomas said he and his peers launched a multifront campaign that not only concentrated on pressuring the UC Regents, but also involved travelling to Sacramento to convince the lawmakers about the urgent need for a sustainable funding mechanism for the entire UC system.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never say &#8216;my political achievements,&#8217; because they never mine, but with my peers we stopped a tuition hike last year,&#8221; Thomas said.</p>
<p>Thomas also travelled to Washington D.C. in spring quarter, meeting with representatives from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s office, Rep. Zoe Lofgren&#8217;s office and other members of the California delegation.</p>
<p>Title IX enforcement was at the top of the list of concerns, Thomas said. While the Obama administration put pressure on universities to ramp up their efforts to prevent and respond to sexual violence, the Trump administration under Secretery of Education Betsy DeVos has reversed course arguing due process and presumption of innocence have been compromised by the Obama-era initiative.</p>
<p>Thomas&#8217; tireless advocacy&#8212;including in the need to support undocumented students&#8212;has not gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>Recently, he learned he was accepted into the prestigious Public Policy and International Affairs Junior Summer Institute at the Gerald Ford School of Public Policy in Ann Arbor, Mich.</p>
<p>&#8220;You essentially go and learn from the brightest public policy minds in the country,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very competitive program and I am surprised I got into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program will not only provide Thomas with an enriching educational experience but also provide a pipeline should Thomas decide to pursue advanced degrees in graduate school.</p>
<p>Thomas isn&#8217;t quite sure about his next step. He is contemplating the pursuit of a masters or Ph.D. but he also flirts with offering his services as an intern to lawmakers in Sacramento.</p>
<p>Thomas will forge a career that incorporates his passion for politics and ultimately sets him up to give back to the community that raised him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I come from a community where a lot of the folks who look like me end up getting shot in the streets or in jail,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;I want to get my education and go back to the same community that got me here and use my education to make it better.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7ed3861f8072701734bebd3cf3150340"><name>reardon-vatican</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Jenny Reardon participates in Vatican workshop on personalized medicine</title><summary>Sociology Professor Jenny Reardon, a leading voice in the field of genomics, was one of 15 participants invited to attend a workshop on personalized medicine hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. </summary><keywords>vatican, genomics, medicine, personalized medicine</keywords><start-date>1556866800000</start-date><display-name>Reardon-Vatican</display-name><path>/2019/05/reardon-vatican</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/05/reardon-vatican</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1556905952022</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1557877967709</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/reardon-vatican_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/reardon-vatican_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>reardon-vatican_300.jpg</name><display-name>reardon-vatican_300.jpg</display-name><file-size>34632</file-size><width>300</width><height>347</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Jenny Reardon at the Vatican</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/reardon-vatican_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/reardon-vatican_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>reardon-vatican_80.jpg</name><display-name>reardon-vatican_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>3925</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Jenny Reardon at the Vatican</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jenny Reardon says the Vatican was a stunning backdrop to explore the profound questions of personalized medicine.

<p>The workshop, "<a href="http://www.pas.va/content/accademia/en/events/2019/medicine.html">The Revolution of Personalized Medicine: Are We Going to Cure All Diseases and at What Price?</a>," took place April 8-9 in Vatican City. With an emphasis on the bioethical complexity of genomics, as well as the technological challenges, the workshop brought together leading minds from around the world to assess this new era in medicine.</p>
<p>Among the attendees were pioneers of the field of genomics, including Eric Lander, a principal leader of the Human Genome Project and president of the Broad Institute; Christopher Austin, director of the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences; leaders in medical ethics, including Joseph Fins, <span>chief of the Division of Medical Ethics at Weill Cornell Medical College, and </span>Nobel Laureate Aaron Ciechanover.</p>
<p>Reardon is the author of the 2017 book <a href="https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo22726485.html"><em>The Post Genomic Condition: Ethics, Justice, and Knowledge After the Genome</em></a> and <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/7891.html"><em>Race to the Finish: Identity and Governance in an Age of Genomics</em></a>. The founding director of the Science and Justice Research Center at UC Santa Cruz, Reardon brings questions about identity, justice, and democracy to her scrutiny of genomics and the promise of personalized medicine. In 2018, Reardon coauthored an <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/bfopinion/race-genetics-david-reich#.drlM3EPWx">open letter</a> signed by 67 scholars responding to Harvard University's David Reich's op-ed in the <em>New York Times </em>about genetics and race.</p>
<p>A persistent advocate for public dialogue about genomics, Reardon was honored to participate in the Vatican workshop. "The Catholic Church reaches millions of people around the globe," she noted. "How it discusses these issues is very important."</p>
<p>Reardon said workshop discussions revolved around three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The relationship between wealth and health, specifically the cost of personalized medicine;</li>
<li>Governance of science, and the interplay of science and ethics;</li>
<li>The challenge of evaluating the revolutionary nature of genomics: Is this a paradigm shift in science, or not?</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;"We had an intense conversation about the governance of science arising out of the CRISPR babies case," recalled Reardon, referring to the birth of twins in China whose genomes were edited in hopes of protecting them from HIV infection. Despite the 2015 declaration of a public moratorium on this type of work, except in critical cases where there is no other medical treatment available, He Jiankui revealed at the end of November that he broke rank and had used CRISPR to alter the DNA of human embryos. "Now, he is thought to be held under house arrest in China," said Reardon. "Questions that have arisen in the months since is why other scientists and ethicists who knew about his work did not speak up, and should those who helped him also be held accountable?"</p>
<p>The birth of those babies underscores Reardon's persistent concern about the need to change the culture and practice of science and engineering to integrate ethical thinking into the process of innovation. "We need to fundamentally rethink and redo scientific responsibility," she said.</p>
<p>While bringing such a diverse group together always poses challenges, the discussions were productive, said Reardon. "We were thinking big picture, and we were quite frank with each other," she said. "There were a lot of disagreements, but the biggest questions were on the table. We knew our audience was the Pope."</p>
<p>Participants engaged deeply with questions of knowledge, as well as governance: "How much can we know from all this genomic information?" said Reardon.</p>
<p>As powerful as the new techniques of genomics are, they also raise questions about the limits of knowing the human body. "There was a time when science thought that once we had those 3 billion nucleotides, we'd have the answers," she said, referring to sequencing the human genome. "There is now widespread recognition that it is not easy to move from those 3 billion nucleotides to medical insights. Biological life is complex. "</p>
<p>The Vatican was a stunning backdrop to explore such profound questions. "We stayed in the Domus Sanctae Marthae, where the Pope lives, and we ate in the dining room of the Pope's former residence," said Reardon, who visited St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican Museum. Learning about the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and its reach was fascinating, she noted. "It's a way for the Catholic Church to have a say in science and be relevant beyond believers," she said.</p>
<p>Before the workshop began, each of the 15 invitees was asked to submit position papers; Reardon's paper is entitled, "Genomics&#8217; Problem of Meaning." Each invitee was also asked to respond to at least two of the position papers before the workshop begins. In both her paper and commentaries, Reardon focused on the problem of meaning created by the early decision in the genomic era to sequence genomic data first&#8212;and interpret later.</p>
<p>"The result is that today there exists powerful capacities to sequence data, but not robust abilities to interpret and responsibly govern them," she said. "Addressing this critical lacuna will require moving beyond the traditional bounds of bioethics&#8212;circumscribed by concerns about privacy, consent and property&#8212;to ask more fundamental questions of knowledge and justice."</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drawings, posted on Facebook by Degener&#8217;s mom, showed haunting images: a young woman with shadowed eyes, a trio of women, one of them an anxious-looking cyclops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everyone was commenting about how talented Maris was,&#8221; says VanZee Taylor by phone from her Walnut Creek home, &#8220;but I couldn&#8217;t believe no one asked what they (the drawings) meant, what was going on there. They were really dark.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those questions would lead VanZee Taylor to create a powerful 54-minute documentary film titled</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I Am Maris</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that explores Degener&#8217;s fall into anorexia, her discovery of the healing power of yoga, and her eventual recovery. The film is now screening on Netflix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today the 20-year-old UC Santa Cruz College Ten junior who is majoring in psychology, is also getting requests to speak from Spain to Australia. She has given talks at Lululemon headquarters in Canada and to student groups from the College of Marin to UC Irvine. Parents, therapists, and those suffering from eating disorders have contacted her, and her Instagram account has grown from 7,000 followers to 35,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was just really inspired by her,&#8221; VanZee Taylor says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting at a table outside McHenry Library, Degener says that, as a child, she was prone to anxiety with a tendency toward depression. She also was a competitive student and athlete who felt the need to excel in everything she did. But as she transitioned from junior high into high school, she began to feel like she didn&#8217;t have an identity and, no matter how many accolades she got, she was never good enough. There were also changes at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She began to restrict what she ate almost as competitively as she&#8217;d done with her sports and school work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My eating disorder was my sense of control,&#8221; Degener says. &#8220;If I could control what I was eating, I felt like I was in control of an uncontrollable situation.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of her freshman year of high school, Degener was in the hospital. Her heart rate and blood pressure were dangerously low, her hair was falling out, her skin was grey. Eventually, she was released back home and her doctor suggested yoga as a way to exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I rolled my eyes and thought, &#8216;That&#8217;s just hippie stuff,&#8217;&#8221; Degener says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she happened to see a flyer for a free class at a new yoga studio and decided to go. At one point during the crowded class, the teacher asked everyone to get up and just start dancing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I realized, at one point, that I was smiling and it was the first time I&#8217;d smiled in two years,&#8221; Degener says. &#8220;And the fact I was smiling when I wasn&#8217;t being good at something was revolutionary.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Degener went back to class again and again, discovering the healing power of Vinyasa yoga, which besides movement and breath, also emphasizes ethical standards like truthfulness, contentment, not coveting things, and letting go of the need to control. The studio owner then helped her understand how to take what she learned on the yoga mat into the real world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoga became her healing tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eating was always symptom of a greater root cause,&#8221; Degener says. &#8220;Eating was one way I was able to control what I was feeling. Sometimes I still bump up against the root causes&#8212;perfectionism, anxiety, and feeling out of control&#8212;but now I have ways to cope with it. I cope with it through yoga and time outside and the help of therapists and friends.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now a certified yoga instructor, Degener teaches two classes at UC Santa Cruz, both of which are always full. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For VanZee, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Am Maris</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not only her first full-length documentary film but also a way to reach those dealing with anxiety, depression, or addiction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was about: How do you go to a dark place and dig yourself out?&#8221; she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The documentary features Degener and her family telling stories of their confusion, shame, and even anger as Degener moved through her illness. There are shots of Degener in powerful yoga poses, glimpses of her art. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wanted to show mental illness isn&#8217;t a curse for life,&#8221; VanZee says. &#8220;I wanted to show people with mental illness, once they turn it around and work with it, are the most interesting, empathetic, brave, and strongest people I know.&#8221;</span></p>

with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) to present a daylong <a href="https://www.lacma.org/event/symposium-isaac-julien-playtime"><em><strong>symposium</strong></em></a> on the works of influential British filmmaker and installation artist, Isaac Julien.</p>
<p>A central figure in British visual culture, black British cultural studies, and queer independent cinema for the last two decades, Julien recently joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty as a distinguished professor of the arts.</p>
<p>The symposium will take place on May 18 in conjunction with the exhibition,<span><strong>&#160;</strong></span><a href="https://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/isaac-julien-playtime"><strong><em>I</em><em>sa</em><em>ac Julien: Playtime</em></strong></a>, his first major presentation in Los Angeles, running at LACMA from May 5 to August 11.</p>
<p>Held in the permanent collection at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, <em>Playtime</em><span>&#160;</span>(2014) is a critique of the influence of capital in the art world, starring James Franco, Maggie Cheung, Colin Salmon, and auctioneer Simon de Pury. Six vignettes demonstrate the different levels of how money has an affect on the production, dealing, and collecting of contemporary art, as well as the lives impacted by the system.<span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><em>Playtime</em> has been exhibited at Fort Mason, San Francisco (2017), Platform-L Contemporary Arts Center, Seoul (2017); and Museo Universitario Arte Contempora&#769;neo, Mexico City (2016); among other venues around the globe.</p>
<p><strong>The symposium at LACMA</strong> will include screenings, talks, and panel discussions with historians, scholars and artists responding to additional major films from Julien&#8217;s collected works.</p>
<p>Speakers at the event will include UC Santa Cruz arts professors B. Ruby Rich, Jennifer Gonz&#225;lez, Mark Nash, and Isaac Julien, as well as UCSC philosophy alumnus Jeffrey Conrad Stewart&#8212;who just last month was awarded a<strong><em> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/04/pulitzer-philosophy-alumnus.html">2019 Pulitzer Prize</a></em></strong> for biography.</p>
<p>"It is encouraging to have UC Santa Cruz represented in Los Angeles at an institution as prestigious as LACMA with this focus on Isaac Julien,&#8221; noted UC Santa Cruz film and digital media professor B. Ruby Rich. &#8220;His <em>Playtime</em> is such a consequential work, addressing the grievous contradictions of our times with his trademark elegance and brilliance. I look forward to seeing its configuration at LACMA, as this will mark the fourth time I've seen it, installed in always-different ways, in different cities and sites.&#8221;</p>
<p>"I&#8217;m also looking forward to my conversation with Isaac on the LACMA stage,&#8217; Rich added, &#8220;and to looking back to the beginning of his career and the promise that was there, even then, of his brilliance, fearlessness, aesthetic originality, and political nuance."</p>
<p>Julien&#8217;s work can be found in museum and private collections throughout the world, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Tate, the UK Government Art Collection, Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and the Brandhorst Museum.</p>
<p>He has previously held a number of professorial, teaching and research positions in the field of visual arts and cultural theory over the course of his career, including Chair of Global Art at University of Arts, London, and Professor of Media Art at Staatliche Hoscschule fur Gestaltung, Karlsruhe.</p>
<p><strong>Julien&#8217;s partner and collaborator</strong>, independent curator and writer Mark Nash, has also recently joined the faculty of the Arts Division at UC Santa Cruz. Nash is the former head of contemporary art at the Royal College of Art in London.</p>
<p>Nash and Julien are now working together at UC Santa Cruz to develop the <a href="http://danm.ucsc.edu/project_group/isaac-julien-lab"><strong><em>Isaac Julien Lab</em></strong></a>, which will provide students with the opportunity to assist Julien with project research and the production of moving and still image works on campus.</p>
<p>The lab is currently being designed as a mirror for Julien&#8217;s London studio, and students will additionally be able to spend an academic quarter in London.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an affinity for Santa Cruz that began in the 1990s when Mark and I were here making the film <em>Frantz Fanon: Black Skin, White Mask</em> in partnership with colleagues in the History of Consciousness program,&#8221; said Julien.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have always carried that spirit in our work so when we were approached to be on faculty, it felt like a homecoming of sorts. In fact, we have long admired the scholarship at Santa Cruz and were inspired by the vision of a laboratory model for artistic research and production which UC Santa Cruz is pioneering,&#8221; he added.</p>

Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation.</p>
<p>The Goldwater Scholarship is a prestigious national competition for undergraduates in the fields of mathematics, science, and engineering. The scholarships provide up to $7,500 per year for sophomores and juniors from across the country to cover the costs of tuition, fees, books, and other expenses.</p>
<p>The foundation awarded 496 scholarships this year, selecting the scholars on the basis of academic merit from a field of 1,223 students nominated by representatives of colleges and universities nationwide.</p>
<p>Wong has been doing research on Alzheimer's disease in the laboratory of Jeremy Lee, professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz. She also did a summer research internship in Susan Ackerman's lab at UC San Diego through a Howard Hughes Medical Institute program, working to identify a gene involved in ataxia and cerebellar degeneration in mice, and will be continuing that work this summer.</p>

<p>Researchers used NASA's <a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> to observe some of the first galaxies to form in the universe, less than 1 billion years after the Big Bang (or a little more than 13 billion years ago). The data show that in a few specific wavelengths of infrared light, the galaxies are considerably brighter than anticipated. The new study is the first to confirm this observation for a large sampling of galaxies from this period, demonstrating that these were not special cases of unusual brightness, but that even average galaxies present at that time were much brighter in these wavelengths than galaxies we see today.</p>
<p>The results indicate that these early galaxies were releasing high amounts of ionizing radiation, which may have contributed to a major event known as the "epoch of reionization," when the universe went from being mostly opaque to mostly transparent.</p>
<p>Garth Illingworth, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and a member of the team, said the new study provides insight into a select set of galaxies that can be studied with the Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescopes, revealing just how unusual these early galaxies were.</p>
<p>"For over ten years, we have been studying with Hubble and Spitzer some of the earliest and most distant galaxies known," Illingworth said. "Our latest Spitzer result reveals how different these early galaxies are to those at later times and pinpoints our sample as a key set for providing insights into how galaxies so efficiently reionized the universe."</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that between about 100 million and 200 million years after the Big Bang, the universe was filled mostly with neutral hydrogen gas that had perhaps just begun to coalesce into stars, which then began to form the first galaxies. By about 1 billion years after the Big Bang, the universe had become a sparkling firmament. Something else had changed, too: The electrons of the omnipresent neutral hydrogen gas had been stripped away, in a process known as ionization.</p>
<p><strong>Cosmic transformation</strong></p>
<p>Before this cosmic transformation took place, long-wavelength forms of light, such as radio waves and visible light, traversed the universe more or less unencumbered. But shorter wavelengths of light, including ultraviolet light, x-rays and gamma rays, were stopped short by neutral hydrogen atoms. At the same time, these collisions would strip those neutral hydrogen atoms of their electrons, ionizing them.</p>
<p>But what could have produced enough ionizing radiation to affect all the hydrogen in the universe? Was it individual stars? Giant galaxies? If either of these were the culprit, they would have been different than most modern stars and galaxies, which typically don't release high amounts of ionizing radiation. Then again, perhaps the event was caused by something else entirely, such as quasars.</p>
<p>"It's one of the biggest open questions in observational cosmology," said Stephane de Barros, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. "We know it happened, but what caused it? These new findings could be a big clue."</p>
<p>To peer back in time to the era just before the epoch of reionization ended, Spitzer stared at two regions of the sky for more than 200 hours each, allowing the space telescope to collect light that had traveled for more than 13 billion years to reach us. These are some of the longest science observations ever carried out by Spitzer, and were part of an observing campaign called GREATS, short for GOODS Re-ionization Era wide-Area Treasury from Spitzer. GOODS (itself an acronym: Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey) is another campaign that did the first observations of some of the GREATS targets. The study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz940">published in the <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em></a>, also used archival data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p><strong>Ultra-deep observations</strong></p>
<p>Using these ultra-deep observations by Spitzer, the team of astronomers observed 135 of those distant galaxies and found that they were all particularly bright in two specific wavelengths of infrared light produced by ionizing radiation interacting with hydrogen and oxygen gases within the galaxies. This implies that these galaxies were dominated by young, massive stars composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. They contain very small amounts of "heavy" elements (like nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen) compared to stars found in average modern galaxies.</p>
<p>"We did not expect that Spitzer, with a mirror no larger than a hula hoop, would be capable of seeing galaxies so close to the dawn of time," said Michael Werner, Spitzer's project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. "But nature is full of surprises, and the unexpected brightness of these early galaxies, together with Spitzer&#8217;s superb performance, puts them within range of our small but powerful observatory."</p>
<p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope will study the universe in many of the same wavelengths currently observed by Spitzer. But where Spitzer's primary mirror is only 85 centimeters (33.4 inches) in diameter, Webb's primary mirror is 6.5 meters (21 feet), or about 7.5 times larger, enabling Webb to study these galaxies in far greater detail. In fact, Webb will try to detect light from the first stars and galaxies in the universe. The new study shows that, due to their brightness in those infrared wavelengths, the galaxies observed by Spitzer will be much easier for Webb to study than previously thought.</p>
<p>"These results by Spitzer are certainly another step in solving the mystery of cosmic reionization," said Pascal Oesch, an assistant professor at the University of Geneva and a coauthor of the paper. "We now know that the physical conditions in these early galaxies were very different than in typical galaxies today. It will be the job of the James Webb Space Telescope to work out the detailed reasons why."</p>
<p>The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, manages the Spitzer Space Telescope mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

<p>The public is invited to attend the institute with Perlas, an author and activist who will lead a five-day discussion focused on "Humanizing Artificial Intelligence: Using Cultural Power Governance and Business to Address the Challenges of Our Time."</p>
<p>Perlas is a Philippines-based activist and a central voice on issues of globalization, sustainability, and participatory governance and direct democracy. His books include the international bestseller <em>Shaping Globalization: Civil Society, Cultural Power and Threefolding</em>, and <em>Humanity's Last Stand: The Challenge of Artificial Intelligence, a Spiritual Scientific Response</em>.</p>
<p>The gathering will take place July 8-12 on the UC Santa Cruz campus. The cost is $460 for students and community members, and $860 for researchers and faculty; limited scholarships are available. Room and board is additional, and commuter tickets are available for those who do not need on-campus housing. The deadline for <a href="https://rightlivelihood.ucsc.edu/events/summer-institute.html">registration</a> is May 28.</p>
<p>Perlas will also be on campus June 6 for a free public talk on the same topic of humanizing artificial intelligence. That event, cosponsored by the Kresge Common Ground Center and moderated by Sikina Jinnah, professor of politics, begins at 7 p.m. in the Kresge College Seminar Room. <a href="https://rightlivelihood.ucsc.edu/events/perlas.html">Advance registration</a> is requested.</p>

The prestigious five-year grant provides flexible, long-term funding for Millhauser's research program focused on understanding the role of the prion protein in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Prions are misfolded proteins that cause fatal neurodegenerative brain disorders such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cows ("mad cow disease"), and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk. The normal cellular prion protein is found in all mammals as a membrane protein on the surfaces of various cell types, including neurons in the brain. Misfolded prions are transmissible and can induce the normal form of the protein to adopt the abnormal, toxic shape.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, Millhauser's lab has made significant progress in understanding the structure and function of the normal cellular prion protein. His research has shown that the protein binds metal ions, specifically copper and zinc, and controls the distribution of these essential elements in the brain. Importantly, he and his collaborators have also shown that the protein has two domains, one of which has toxic effects that drive brain cell damage when not controlled by the other domain.</p>
<p>"There are two halves to the protein--one half produces toxicity, and the other half is a regulatory domain that keeps the protein in a nontoxic state," Millhauser explained. "Our research shows that the interaction between the two domains is controlled by the binding of physiological metal ions."</p>
<p>Ongoing research in his lab is aimed at understanding the nature of the toxic signal, as well as the normal function of the toxic domain when it is properly regulated. Millhauser is also interested in following up on findings by other researchers suggesting that the prion protein may be involved in Alzheimer's disease. Studies have shown that aggregates of a protein called amyloid beta, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease, bind to the cellular prion protein.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of effort now to understand how amyloid-beta aggregates interact with the prion protein," Millhauser said.</p>
<p>Another interaction of interest to his lab is between the cellular prion protein and receptors for the neurotransmitter glutamate. This interaction may be a key to the normal function of the prion protein, Millhauser said.</p>
<p>Millhauser's lab uses advanced magnetic resonance spectroscopy to analyze the structure and function of complex proteins. In the prion research, he works closely with a team at Boston University School of Medicine led by Dr. David Harris.</p>
<p>The MIRA grant provides extended funding with the needed flexibility to pursue new leads and make efficient progress in this highly important and rapidly changing biomedical field.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="93c7dd2b8072701734bebd3cb721fb39"><name>pile-burns-wrap-up</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cal Fire aims to wrap up pile burns near campus before fire season</title><summary>Cal Fire has advised campus officials that state fire crews over the next two weeks aim to wrap up the burning of vegetation piles they have assembled near campus, weather conditions permitting. </summary><start-date>1557212400000</start-date><display-name>Cal Fire aims to wrap up pile burns near campus before fire season</display-name><path>/2019/05/pile-burns-wrap-up</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/05/pile-burns-wrap-up</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1557257509384</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1557257509384</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>Cal Fire has advised campus officials that state fire crews over the next two weeks aim to wrap up the burning of vegetation piles they have assembled near campus, weather conditions permitting.&#160;<br/><br/>The piles are on both sides of Empire Grade, north of Twin Gates.

When free expression disrupts our ability to offer classes, administer exams, carry on research, or run the university in general&#8212;or when it violates university policy or the law in any way&#8212;then it may be subject to disciplinary consequences.</span></span></p>

<h3>You wouldn&#8217;t know from meeting him&#8230;</h3>
A <a href="https://dickens.ucsc.edu/universe/">Dickens Universe</a> regular, Mike Stern&#8217;s conversation is a rich stream of ideas. On topics he cares about&#8212;General Magic, Dickens&#8212;he conveys infectious, wide-eyed enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Matt Maude, coproducer and director of the film, really enjoys introducing him with details such as his arrest while protesting the Vietnam War as a Columbia undergraduate, becoming a reporter for the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post before beginning a career as a scholar of literature, then practicing intellectual property law with one of Silicon Valley&#8217;s leading law firms (a role from which Stern recently retired). <br/><br/>&#8220;I get halfway through and people&#8217;s mouths are hanging wide,&#8221; Maude says.<br/><br/>At Dickens Universe, which he has attended without fail since 2012, Stern is an enthusiastic and gregarious participant, says Dickens Project Director John Jordan.<br/><br/>&#8220;He&#8217;s right there interacting with people from any background. Mike is just an ordinary guy,&#8221; Jordan says. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t know from meeting him that he has a literature Ph.D., and only if you asked would you find out about his legal training.&#8221;<br/><br/>Mary Doyle (Porter &#8216;74, biology, economics), a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, succeeded Stern at General Magic. Doyle describes Stern as a wonderful mentor and an insightful attorney. <br/><br/>&#8220;Those who have had the chance to work with Mike can&#8217;t say enough about his kindness, his humility, his readiness to redirect the spotlight to those coming up behind him,&#8221; Doyle says. <br/>
<h3>&#8220;Dickens Camp&#8221;</h3>
In 2011 The New Yorker published <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2011/08/new-yorker-dickens.html">a feature with an in-depth description of the Dickens Universe</a>. Stern, a fan of Dickens since college, was delighted to find the event a short drive from home. <br/><br/>&#8220;I thought, &#8216;Oh my God! I didn&#8217;t know this was there. I have to go. I just have to go,&#8217;&#8221; Stern says. &#8220;It turned out the featured book that summer was Bleak House, which is the great Dickens book for lawyers. And so it was a perfect match.&#8221;<br/><br/>A few years later, Stern joined Jordan in making a generous gift to the Dickens Project. Combined with matching funds from the University of California, their gift established the Jordan-Stern Presidential Chair for Dickens and Nineteenth-Century Studies. The endowed chair freed the Dickens Project from the need to constantly seek operational funds, says Professor Murray Baumgarten, the program&#8217;s founder.<br/><br/>&#8220;The chair has been enormously important,&#8221; Baumgarten says. &#8220;It has solidified the project and put it on stable ground.&#8221; <br/><br/>In addition, the chair funds research, including the recently published The Oxford Handbook of Charles Dickens. Jordan, one of three editors, expects it will be a primary reference about Dickens for at least the next 10 years.<br/>
<h3>Failure is just the beginning</h3>
In addition to becoming deeply involved in the Dickens Universe, Stern became immersed in a different kind of storytelling with his documentary on General Magic. In 1990, Apple spun off General Magic, charging the small company with doing for telecommunication what the Macintosh had done for personal computers. Four years later General Magic began selling &#8220;personal intelligent communicators.&#8221; The handheld phones ran a variety of applications&#8212;much the way smartphones would.<br/><br/>&#8220;The idea that I could hold something in my hand,&#8221; Stern says, &#8220;that integrated access to knowledge, personal interaction, shopping, you name it&#8212;that it would all be in my hand&#8212;the idea just seemed &#8216;Yes, we have to do this.&#8217;&#8221;<br/><br/>At first the company followed an upward trajectory. It went public with enormous investment from companies including Sony, Motorola, and AT&amp;T. Then the communicators didn&#8217;t sell. General Magic adapted some of the technology for other purposes before it went out of business&#8212;its voice recognition software would become the core of OnStar. <br/><br/>&#8220;Everything we take for granted about social and mobile and ecommerce and all the rest was developed at Magic,&#8221; Stern says. &#8220;We were just too soon.&#8221;<br/>
<h3>It takes tens of thousands</h3>
Maude was drawn to help with General Magic to tell the stories of the many people who contributed to General Magic&#8217;s product. <br/><br/>&#8220;If you think about tech today. Each company is personified by one person. That&#8217;s not real,&#8221; Maude says. &#8221;It takes tens of thousands of people to make those technologies.&#8221;<br/><br/>The film is scripted to follow a traditional narrative arc, says Jennifer Calvanico, who organized archival video and did fact-checking. General Magic often had cameras recording what was happening at the company in the early 90s, so much of the story is conveyed through that archival video. <br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very familiar story,&#8221; says Calvanico (Ph.D. &#8216;20, feminist studies). &#8220;The movie explores &#8216;What is failure?&#8217; &#8216;What is success?&#8217; &#8216;What is technological change, and what is the time for it?&#8217;&#8221;<br/><br/>Stern says he hopes audiences will see that Magic&#8217;s failure carries a message about persistence. <br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just incredible success stories: Mark Zuckerberg drops out of Harvard and does Facebook; Steve Jobs drops out of Reed and does Apple,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The valley is really about failure as a necessary precursor for success. And Magic was a classic failure, but it set the table for everything that came after it.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="98682fd18072701734bebd3c385b37a0"><name>ayzner-career-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chemist Alexander Ayzner wins NSF CAREER Award</title><summary>Major grant supports Ayzner's research on soft self-assembling systems for harvesting energy from light.</summary><start-date>1557298800000</start-date><display-name>Chemist Alexander Ayzner wins NSF CAREER Award</display-name><path>/2019/05/ayzner-career-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/05/ayzner-career-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1557335125020</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1557335364855</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/alex-ayzner-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/alex-ayzner-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alex-ayzner-350.jpg</name><display-name>alex-ayzner-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>90703</file-size><width>350</width><height>380</height></image><image-alt>Alex Ayzner</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/alex-ayzner-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/alex-ayzner-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alex-ayzner-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>alex-ayzner-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26009</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alex Ayzner</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Alex Ayzner (photo by C. Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Alexander Ayzner, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, has received a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support his research on soft self-assembling systems for harvesting energy from light.</p>
<p>Inspired by the natural light-harvesting machinery in the leaves of plants, Ayzner is developing macromolecular building blocks that absorb light and are capable of highly efficient electronic energy transfer, similar to that performed by the natural light-harvesting antenna proteins in plant chloroplasts. Ultimately, he hopes to design a complex, self-assembling system that can use light energy to generate electricity or produce chemical fuels.</p>
<p>"The applications would be on a small scale, to provide a local power source for a small device or a molecular machine," Ayzner said. "The goal is not to replace the solar cells used in rooftop panels but to construct a soft, microscopic energy converter that could one day function as an artificial light-harvesting organelle akin to those found in nature. By incorporating such assemblies into flexible and stretchable platforms, these soft light-harvesting systems could open up a range of novel applications."</p>
<p>Ayzner also plans to use the topic of energy-harvesting molecules as a vehicle to teach advanced chemical problem-solving skills in a course targeting chemistry transfer students.</p>
<p>The CAREER Awards are NSF's most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization. The award provides $675,000 over five years to support Ayzner's research, education, and outreach activities.</p>
<p>Ayzner's lab has demonstrated ultrafast electronic energy transfer in water-soluble, electronically-active polymer systems called inter-conjugated polyelectrolyte complexes (CPECs). With the new grant, he and his graduate students will focus initially on studying the fundamental factors that govern electronic energy transfer in these complexes and characterizing their properties in complex fluids.</p>
<p>Ayzner's lab is also investigating the use of liposomes (artificial vesicles with a lipid bilayer envelope) to serve as a scaffold for self-assembly of CPEC-based light-harvesting antennae. This could form the foundation for a hierarchically assembled soft light-harvesting device.</p>
<p>The problem-solving course Ayzner is developing aims to prepare chemistry students for physical chemistry, a demanding course that many transfer students find especially challenging. The two-quarter problem-solving course will also prepare students to tackle open-ended research problems and encourage them to get involved in undergraduate research projects.</p>
<p>"My main goal is to help develop students' abstract chemical thinking skills and to provide them with the confidence to succeed as independent scientists," he said.</p>
<p>Ayzner earned his Ph.D. in physical chemistry at UCLA and did postdoctoral research at Stanford University before joining the UCSC faculty in 2014.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9d54fe4b8072701734bebd3cfdca9e6d"><name>keith-brant-retiring</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Vice chancellor for University Relations to retire</title><summary>We write to share the news that Keith Brant, vice chancellor for University Relations, has announced he will retire at the end of the academic year, capping a 28-year career with the University of California.&#13;

Keith's last day will be June 30.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Keith's leadership has significantly advanced a culture of philanthropy at UC Santa Cruz. Our first comprehensive fundraising campaign was a tremendous success, bringing in more than $335 million in gifts, while our 50th anniversary celebration highlighted all that we have accomplished over the past five decades &#8212; and all the promise that remains for our campus. With University Relations leading the way, our campus has grown more strategic in designing and hosting events, and has shifted toward digital-first communications that broaden our university's voice.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Please join us in thanking Keith for his service to our campus and system, and in wishing him all the best as he retires from the university. The campus will soon begin a search for his successor.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">In the meantime, we are pleased to announce that Jeff Shilling, associate vice chancellor for philanthropy, has agreed to serve as interim vice chancellor for the division. Jeff's appointment will begin June 1, pending approval from UC President Janet Napolitano.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Jeff previously served as interim vice chancellor from 2013 to 2014, shortly after the campus launched its fundraising campaign. Jeff's team was central to the success of the campaign, helping to secure a number of transformational gifts, including the Cowell Hay Barn renovation and more than a dozen new endowed faculty chairs, and additional gifts that support the university's mission of research, teaching, and service.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0 0;">Jeff joined UC Santa Cruz in 2010 after working at Stanford University, where he was chief development officer for the Department of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation. He previously held positions in reunion giving and major gifts at Stanford's Graduate School of Business.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9ef778b48072701734bebd3c9c15e2da"><name>kapuscinski-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Anne Kapuscinski receives 2019 Ocean Award for innovation</title><summary>Anne Kapuscinski, professor of environmental studies and director of the Coastal Science and Policy Program, has received a 2019 Ocean Award for innovation from Boat International magazine and the Blue Marine Foundation.</summary><keywords>microalgae, kapuscinski, marine, fish, aquaculture</keywords><start-date>1557385200000</start-date><display-name>Kapuscinski-Award</display-name><path>/2019/05/kapuscinski-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/05/kapuscinski-award</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1557445178738</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1557507885587</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/kapuscinski-award.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/kapuscinski-award.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kapuscinski-award.jpg</name><display-name>kapuscinski-award.jpg</display-name><file-size>53729</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Anne Kapuscinski working in a lab with fish</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/kapuscinski_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/kapuscinski_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kapuscinski_80.jpg</name><display-name>kapuscinski_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>3573</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Head shot of Anne Kapuscinski</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Anne Kapuscinski was recognized for her work leading a team that is developing microalgae feed for farmed fish--an alternative to fishmeal and fish oil extracted from wild fish, such as anchovies and sardines.

<p><a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/luxury-yacht-events/ocean-awards/the-ocean-awards-2019--40373/frame-4">Kapuscinski was recognized</a> for her work in aquaculture and the development of microalgae feed for farmed fish. Aquaculture is the world's fastest-growing food sector, and the demand is increasing for sustainable sources of protein to feed farmed fish. Kapuscinski and her team are investigating the use of microalgae to make ocean-friendly feeds that support fish growth and omega-3 content&#8212;replacing fishmeal and fish oil extracted from wild fish, such as anchovies and sardines.</p>
<p>The 2019 Ocean Awards were presented by Boat International, a global publication focused on superyachts and the yachting lifestyle, and the <a href="https://www.bluemarinefoundation.com/">Blue Marine Foundation</a> (BLUE), a UK-based charity dedicated to creating marine reserves and establishing sustainable models of fishing. The awards will be presented in London in June.</p>
<p>The Innovation Award recognizes individuals and organizations that are making a positive, long-term impact on the marine environment "as opposed to using new, innovative technology." Silent Yachts was also recognized for innovation for its development of a solar-hybrid ocean-going catamaran.</p>
<p>Ocean Award recipients are chosen from nominees submitted from all over the world. Kapuscinski expressed delight about the recognition.</p>
<p>"This is exciting news," said Kapuscinski, who learned of the award on her way back from chairing a meeting of the board of directors of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Boston. "This honor highlights the urgency to conserve our oceans, and I look forward to representing UC Santa Cruz, the Coastal Science and Policy program, and my creative research team at the awards ceremony."</p>

<p>The purpose of performance management is to effectively engage teams in the mission of the university. The key to effective performance management involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crafting goals that are specific, important (mission-based) and measurable.</li>
<li>Frequent and candid feedback to all team members about their performance.</li>
<li>Coaching and support for staff to enable them to achieve their goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>When goals are well formed and feedback is occurring frequently, the annual performance appraisals become a time to summarize communications that have been occurring throughout the year. It is expected that all staff employees have an appraisal every year and appraisals are required as part of the annual pay for performance cycle for policy covered staff.</p>
<p><strong>Online Appraisal Form</strong></p>
<p>The online appraisal form is an interim tool for the campus to use until the implementation of the ePerformance module of UCPath, expected for the 2019-20 appraisal call.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> All Academic Supervisors, Department Chairs, Principal Investigators, Managers and Supervisors need to use the online appraisal tool to evaluate their staff employees.</p>
<p>Appraisals should be succinct. It is not necessary to report each and every detail of performance. The appraisal is a summary of performance of key expectations including goals and core job responsibilities. It should focus on the impact of performance with a few examples and explanation of the overall rating.</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to the online form:<a href="https://appraisals.ucsc.edu/"> https://appraisals.ucsc.edu</a></li>
<li>Log in with your CruzID and blue password.</li>
<li>Please review the &#8220;help and tutorials&#8221; linked in the left hand navigation for step by step instructions designed to guide employees through the process.</li>
<li>Help is available by emailing <a href="mailto:appraisals@ucsc.edu">appraisals@ucsc.edu</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff HR provides consulting and training to support managers and supervisors in completing appraisals. Your<a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/contact/locate_team.html"> Employee Relations (ER) Analyst</a> can provide you with advice and assistance in discussing pay for performance with your staff and in writing performance appraisals.</p>
<p><strong>Please note: </strong>When writing a performance appraisal that may result in a rating of &#8220;improvement needed,&#8221; or &#8220;unacceptable,&#8221; please engage with your ER analyst for assistance prior to finalizing and/or delivering the performance appraisal.</p>

Astrophysics), and <strong>Anthony Aguirre</strong> (Physics), will face off with <strong>Pranav Anand</strong> (Linguistics), <strong>Sylvanna Falc&#243;n</strong> (Latin American and Latino Studies), and <strong>Nico Orlandi</strong> (Philosophy) to debate how much of our time and resources, if any, should be put into thinking about the far future.<br/><br/>But this won&#8217;t be your ordinary run-of-the-mill debate. Ethics Bowl is very different from traditional debate formats. The teams are&#160;docked for using&#160;rhetoric, spin, aggression,&#160;and&#160;clever rationalization. Instead, each team is judged on the basis of&#160;active listening, flexibility, collaboration, and analytical rigor&#8212;essential ingredients for a meaningful discussion on difficult topics. <br/><br/>&#8220;What the Ethics Bowl does is get people thinking explicitly about the goal of productive discussion on contentious topics, how difficult that is to achieve, and how all of us could do it better,&#8221; said UCSC philosophy professor Jon Ellis, director of the Center for Public Philosophy. &#8220;What&#8217;s great about it is that it gets people of many different backgrounds and perspectives together, not only talking about pressing ethical questions, but doing so in a way that they&#8217;re consciously attending to&#8212;what we sometimes call epistemic or intellectual &#8216;hospitality.&#8217;&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Nearly everyone would agree that our country needs more of this,&#8221; he added.&#160;&#8220;But so do we ourselves, the faculty, and the campus at large.&#160;You might think that faculty are more advanced and skillful at critical thinking, fair-minded active listening, etc. But anyone who&#8217;s been at an Academic Senate meeting, department meeting, and so on, knows that this isn&#8217;t always true.&#8221;<br/><br/>In fact, that&#8217;s what Ellis&#8217;s own <a href="http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/2018/02/rationalization-why-your-intelligence_13.html"><em><strong>research</strong></em></a> is currently about&#8212;the role that motivated reasoning and bias plays, even in people who care greatly about critical thinking, score highly on various measures of intelligence, and are particularly reflective and well-informed.<br/><br/>&#8220;We can be so quick to roll our eyes or express outrage at something we hear,&#8221; Ellis added. &#8220;There&#8217;s definitely a lot to be outraged by, yes, but those quick reactions are so consequential in committing us down a path and making it even harder for the other side not to do the same. Those lightning-quick moments are the source of so much distrust, scorn, and misunderstanding. Ethics Bowl helps you be a little more wary of these human tendencies.&#8221;<br/><br/>But Ellis also points out that being hospitable and open-minded doesn&#8217;t mean not challenging or raising questions for opposing views, or pointing out serious problems with them. &#160;<br/><br/>Ellis notes that the faculty at UC Santa Cruz have widely divergent views on the question of linking research to the far future, thousands of years ahead. Some say that it is critical that we do this. Yet others say why bother when we have absolutely no conception of what things will be like in 1,000 years. Could we really have any impact on the far future? And what does it even mean to put resources into thinking about it?<br/><br/>In the long run though, the Faculty Ethics Bowl is as much about the process as the content. Ellis described what he hoped the campus would take away from the event.<br/><br/>&#8220;One of our main goals is to get the faculty talking and thinking about how we can have better discussions on campus--in classes, department meetings, and with the administration,&#8221; said Ellis. &#8220;We need more attention to these things. Too many of our students feel they can&#8217;t talk for fear of being shot down for expressing their doubts and uncertainties.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Another hope is for people on campus to learn about these questions concerning the far future and why some faculty think it&#8217;s critical that we be thinking about them. And most importantly, for both sides to hear and absorb other people&#8217;s perspectives on them,&#8221; he added. &#160;<br/><br/><em>Ethics and the Far Future</em>, the first UC Santa Cruz Faculty Ethics Bowl, is presented by the <a href="https://publicphilosophy.ucsc.edu"><strong><em>Center for Public Philosophy</em></strong></a> in collaboration with <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/#home"><em><strong>The Humanities Institute</strong></em></a>. The event is free and open to the public. It begins on campus at 5 p.m. on May 20 at the University Center and will be followed by a public reception.

<p>On Thursday, May 9, campus officers arrested Jose Ramon Jacinto, pictured below, at Camper Park on Leonardo Lane on suspicion of a probation violation, possession of narcotics, and possession of burglary tools. He was with two others, a male and female, who were identified and released.</p>
<p>Given the spate of recent burglaries, both vehicle and residential, and the tools Jacinto possessed at the time of his arrest, police are seeking the community&#8217;s assistance in determining if Jacinto or his associates may have been seen in campus areas where other crimes occurred. Anyone who believes they may have seen Jacinto on campus, in our parking lots or colleges, are asked to call the dispatch center at 831-459-2231, Ext. 1.</p>
<h3>Safety Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you feel you or others are in danger, immediately call 911.</li>
<li>Victims of crime as well as witnesses to any crime should report all crimes, suspicious people, activity or information to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, when it is safe to do so, by calling 911. Reports may also be made by utilizing one of the several &#8220;blue light,&#8221; emergency or elevator phones located throughout the campus.</li>
<li>Be alert to your surroundings. Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims. Attempt to keep a safe distance from strangers.</li>
<li>Trust your instincts. If something or someone makes you uneasy, tell someone, avoid the person or leave the area.</li>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>For the first time, the University of California has hired a Cooperative Extension specialist dedicated to organic agriculture.</p>
<p>Joji Muramoto, a longtime research associate with the University of California Santa Cruz, will coordinate a statewide program focused on the organic production of strawberries and vegetables. His first day in the new position will be May 29.</p>
<p>Muramoto is highly regarded for the depth of his knowledge of soil science and for his pioneering contributions to the organic production of strawberries&#8212;a high-value crop that is notoriously vulnerable to pests and soil-borne disease. He will have a joint affiliation with UC's Cooperative Extension (CE) and the Environmental Studies Department and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) at UCSC.</p>
<p>CE specialists serve as liaisons between the university and the agricultural sector, building research programs that align with the needs of farmers and conducting collaborative on-farm studies that address problems growers are facing.</p>
<p>"I'm honored and humbled to have this position," said Muramoto, who plans to focus on soil fertility and the organic management of soil-borne diseases. In his position as assistant specialist, he looks forward to expanding his reach statewide and to coordinating short courses on organic pest management and organic soil fertility management.</p>
<p>CASFS Director Daniel Press said the establishment of an organic specialist is long overdue&#8212;and that Muramoto was an excellent choice.</p>
<p>"This is highly visible, public recognition of the significance of agroecology and organic agriculture," said Press. "It signals to the community of organic growers that we are a partner with them. They know this is for them, and they really love it."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has played a vital role in the flourishing of organic farming on the Central Coast and beyond, through undergraduate education, training provided by the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, CASFS, and faculty research projects, many of which Muramoto supported in his capacity as a research associate. Thirty percent of agriculture in Santa Cruz County is certified organic, said Press, who called the figure "astonishing."</p>
<p>"Joji is an exceptionally accomplished, skilled, talented, and respected scientist," said Press. "His list of publications is as long as many of my colleagues.' Now it's his show. He's the organic production specialist in the state."</p>
<p>It is also a sign of the times that UC Santa Cruz was selected to partner with UC's Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources (ANR) to create this CE position, said Press. Despite its strength in agroecology, Santa Cruz is not one of UC's traditional "ag schools." But times are changing, and the Berkeley, Davis, and Riverside campuses are no longer the only hosts of these valued positions.</p>
<p>"We have a long record of important ag research coming out of UC Santa Cruz, but it hasn't been part of a permanent program or a formal network," said Press, citing <a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2017/03/strawberry-fields-for-better/">pathbreaking work</a> by his colleagues in Environmental Studies, including Professor Emeritus Steve Gliessman, Professor Carol Shennan, former CASFS Director Patricia Allen, and former CASFS Associate Director Sean Swezey, all of whom Muramoto collaborated with. Most recently, in collaboration with Shennan, he helped pioneer the development of anaerobic soil disinfestation, a biological alternative to fumigants that has become a key strategy in conventional and organic strawberry production in coastal California.</p>
<p>"I can't overstate the different ways Joji has been engaged with campus research and undergraduate and graduate students," said Press. "He has played a key role in CASFS research for more than 20 years."</p>
<p><span>In addition to campus support and ANR&#8217;s commitment to provide ongoing funding for half of the position, grants from Gaia Fund, CCOF, and an anonymous donor will help support the position in its initial years.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tragedy inspires a commitment to organic agriculture</strong></p>
<p>Muramoto's commitment to organic agriculture is almost as old as he is. When he was a boy growing up in Tokyo, Muramoto lost his 6-year-old sister to leukemia. His parents were shocked and devastated. Their loss took place when many people in Japan were concerned about pesticide residues in produce, spurred in part by Rachel Carson's book <em>Silent Spring </em>and the emergence of the organic movement in Japan.</p>
<p>"My mother wanted to do something," recalled Muramoto. "There was no direct evidence between pesticide residue and cancer, but she didn't want her daughter's death to have been in vain, so she joined the early organic movement. She started buying organic produce via the '<em>Teikei</em>' system, which is similar to Community Supported Agriculture."</p>
<p>During middle school, Muramoto spent school breaks on organic farms in suburban Tokyo. "Organic farmers there told me repeatedly, 'Soil is the foundation of farming,'" he said. "That's when I got interested in soil science."</p>
<p>Today there is much more evidence showing an association between pesticide use and cancer, and Muramoto said, "It is important to increase our efforts to develop agroecological practices to manage pests without using pesticides."&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Uphill battle to study organic processes</strong></p>
<p>As a young assistant professor studying soil science at an agricultural university in Japan, Muramoto found it difficult to get support for the work he wanted to do on organic production&#8212;while others in his department were well-supported for their work on conventional farming practices, including studies on chemical pesticides. The stress took a toll on Muramoto's health, and he left the university.</p>
<p>He reached out to Steve Gliessman after reading an academic article about Gliessman's early work on organic strawberries. Muramoto visited Gliessman in 1995 and joined Gliessman's agroeology lab at UCSC as a visiting scholar the following year. "I am so thankful, because he gave me the second chance I needed," said Muramoto. "I ended up working on organic strawberries ever since."</p>
<p>The Central Coast is well known around the world for the high concentration of organic production, and UC Santa Cruz is internationally recognized as a hub of organic activity and expertise.</p>
<p>Muramoto looks forward to building his research program; he hopes to develop ways to measure indicators of soil health, including levels of readily decomposable organic carbon and nitrogen. "Soil health has become a mainstream research topic among soil scientists worldwide, but there's no regional data for the Central Coast," he said.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Intuition + scientific expertise = a winning formula</strong></p>
<p>Jim Cochran, founder of Swanton Berry Farm in Davenport, met Muramoto shortly after he arrived in Santa Cruz. Cochran was the first farmer who managed to grow organic strawberries commercially, a success he credits to his collaboration with CASFS researchers, including Gliessman, Swezey, and Muramoto.</p>
<p>"I'm more of an intuitive farmer, but intuition isn't everything," said Cochran, who values the curiosity and scientific discipline Muramoto brought to their collaboration. "Science is super important. You don&#8217;t want to live by one or the other."</p>
<p>Soil biology encompasses physics, chemistry, geology, and biology, making it extraordinarily complex, said Cochran. "There's no magic bullet, but Joji was ready to put a close scientific eye on the complexity of it," he said. "Joji embraced that complexity. Chemical farming was reductionist."</p>
<p>Unlike other academics who specialize in a particular segment of a complex problem, Muramoto takes a "holistic approach" to soil science and has kept his eyes on the larger picture, said Cochran. "He's been able to make some serious progress understanding soil biology, but there's a long way to go&#8212;which is good news for graduate students," he said. "It's wonderful to be able to call Joji and ask him what he thinks."</p>
<p><strong>Benefits for conventional growers, too</strong></p>
<p>Rod Koda of Shinta Kawahara Family Farms has grown strawberries in Watsonville since 1984. He has worked with Muramoto for nearly a decade and attended the "candidate talks" by the three finalists vying for the new organic specialist position. Still, he was "blown away" to learn how long Muramoto has been active in organic research, and the number of researchers across the country with whom he collaborates.</p>
<p>"For me, that was the game changer," said Koda. "Joji is this quiet, humble guy, but he's been working all over the place with so many people."</p>
<p>Koda farms 10 acres conventionally and seven acres organically, and he said "it's time" for organic to get the support it deserves. But all growers can benefit from paying close attention to soil health, he said.&#160;</p>
<p>"Conventional growers, we don't have fumigants like methyl bromide anymore, so we've got to get smarter about how we farm," said Koda. "Joji is going to be a part of that."</p>
<p>Koda first started growing berries organically in 2006, steadily adding acreage over the years. "I eased into it, drawn by the sustainability of organic," he said, adding that organic alternatives to managing pests and controlling soil-borne disease were key to his willingness to make the leap. Muramoto and his colleagues' focus on maximizing soil health and using the functions of soil bacteria and organisms to suppress soil fungal diseases was eye-opening.</p>
<p>"I've learned a lot from Joji over the years," said Koda. "He's going to be the conduit that's going to bring that knowledge to other people&#8212;not just strawberry growers, and not just organic growers. Anyone who pays attention will glean some information from his work and his collaborations with other researchers."</p>

<p>This is the third in a series of five-year NSF grants supporting the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://calteach.ucsc.edu/">Cal Teach</a> program and Education Department in their efforts to increase the number and retention of new, highly qualified science and math teachers in high-need California public schools.</p>
<p>"The goal for this project is to strengthen the regional pipeline that supports students who are interested in math and science teaching careers," said Cal Teach Program Director Gretchen Andreasen.</p>
<p>The Cal Teach program serves UCSC undergraduates in science, mathematics, or engineering majors, as well as prospective transfer students from regional community colleges, who are interested in teaching careers. The program offers a sequence of internship placements in schools during the academic year, as well as summer teaching internships.</p>
<p>Cal Teach workshops and seminars help to support students and prepare them for teaching careers. The program also provides academic and career advising, enrichment opportunities, and financial support for prospective or novice science and math teachers. In addition to serving undergraduates, the program welcomes STEM professionals who want to explore teaching careers.</p>
<p>Much of the funding from the Noyce program grant will go toward scholarships for Cal Teach participants to enter the combined M.A./teaching credential program offered by the UC Santa Cruz Education Department.</p>
<p>"The Noyce Scholarships make a big difference for the credential program in terms of maintaining the size and strength of the math and science cohorts," Andreasen said.</p>
<p>The NSF grant also funds stipends for interns and their mentors in partner schools and for early-career professional development for graduates of the program. About 30 percent of Cal Teach participants go on to careers in teaching, Andreasen said.</p>
<p>"Cal Teach provided me the opportunity to see myself in multiple classroom settings as I considered a career in education," said Noyce Scholar Madeleine Swift. "From my internships, I knew I wanted to be an educator."</p>
<p>UCSC's community college partners in this project are Hartnell College, Cabrillo College, and San Jose City College. The five school district partners are Gonzales Unified, Salinas Union High School, Pajaro Valley Unified, Santa Cruz City Schools, and East Side Union High School District.</p>
<p>By recruiting participants from regional community colleges, the Cal Teach program aims to support prospective math and science teachers who are likely to remain in the area and teach in the partner school districts. Dozens of the program's graduates are now teaching at schools in the Monterey Bay, Salinas Valley, and San Jose regions.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b2c16b0e8072701734bebd3cb5d6d267"><name>news-article1</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>VOTE NOW in 2019 Campus Elections</title><summary>Students are invited to cast their votes on important campus initiatives such as four student fee referenda, and officer elections for undergraduate and graduate student government.

<div></div>
<div>On Thursday, May 9, campus officers arrested Jose Ramon Jacinto, pictured below, at Camper Park on Leonardo Lane on suspicion of a probation violation, possession of narcotics, and possession of burglary tools. He was with two others, a male and female, who were identified and released.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Given the spate of recent burglaries, both vehicle and residential, and the tools Jacinto possessed at the time of his arrest, police are seeking the community&#8217;s assistance in determining if Jacinto or his associates may have been seen in campus areas where other crimes occurred. Anyone who believes they may have seen Jacinto on campus, in our parking lots or colleges, are asked to call the dispatch center at 831-459-2231, Ext. 1.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Safety Tips</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>If you feel you or others are in danger, immediately call 911.</li>
<li>Victims of crime as well as witnesses to any crime should report all crimes, suspicious people, activity or information to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, when it is safe to do so, by calling 911. Reports may also be made by utilizing one of the several &#8220;blue light,&#8221; emergency or elevator phones located throughout the campus.&#160;</li>
<li>Be alert to your surroundings. Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims. Attempt to keep a safe distance from strangers.</li>

Funded by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the center will focus on fundamental research to enable cyber-secure robotic systems with new capabilities.</p>
<p>The center, which also includes researchers at Duke University and the University of Texas at Austin, will collaborate with the Air Force Research Laboratory. AFOSR selected the team as the single winner of this prestigious Center of Excellence from among several elite groups competing across the nation. The sponsorship will cover an initial two-year period of $2 million, with optional extensions up to a total of six years and $6 million dollars.</p>
<p>Sanfelice's expertise is in the analysis and design of algorithms for cyber-physical systems, which depend on the seamless integration of computational algorithms and physical components, and hybrid dynamical systems, in which continuous and discrete variables interact. His work in this effort involves the <a href="https://cps.soe.ucsc.edu/">Cyber-physical Systems Research Center</a> (CPSRC), an interdisciplinary research and education center at UC Santa Cruz that fosters collaboration and disseminates research results with more than 30 faculty and their students working on a variety of topics pertaining to cyber-physical systems.</p>
<p>"This Center of Excellence is about autonomous systems operating in adversarial environments. Our work will focus on the formulation of mathematical models of these systems and creating algorithms with assured performance and robustness," Sanfelice said. "We want to develop algorithms that not only shield the system from efforts to disrupt communications or performance, but can also identify adversarial behavior and implement counter-measures."</p>
<p>The Center of Excellence will focus on the development of robotic systems that make the best possible decisions despite uncertainties that may occur as a result of denied or corrupted information caused by an adversarial environment. Research topics that members of the center will study include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New mathematical theories and strategies that enable the integration of logic-based decisions with dynamic robotic vehicles;</li>
<li>New machine adaptation and learning development to enable real-time agility in the presence of complex adversarial environments;</li>
<li>New network methods that enable teams of robotic agents to collaborate over resilient networks and cloud computing while also compromising adversaries&#8217; capabilities;</li>
<li>New methods that enable resiliency to cyber attacks, including designed resiliency, monitoring techniques, and flexible computation in the presence of an attack; and</li>
<li>New methods to protect safety and mission-critical information through privacy in computation, communication, and task execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Center of Excellence will also be tasked to develop next-generation autonomous technologies with cyber resiliency and privacy engineered into the design, outcomes that will have widespread impact on commercial and industrial robotic systems, including automated systems in our homes and transportation systems. Privacy, security, guaranteed performance, and safety have become major concerns with regard to the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), as well as the growing autonomous vehicle industry. Any advances for assured autonomy in contested environments will have a significant impact in other contexts, particularly in the areas of privacy and independence.</p>
<p>"We are developing the theoretical foundations for autonomous systems that will be broadly useful for the systems of the future," Sanfelice said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b35af6b48072701734bebd3cc3a36dc8"><name>london-calfresh</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Addressing student hunger boosts academic success, too </title><summary>A new study suggests that enrolling students in CalFresh—the state's food assistance program for low-income residents—not only addresses student hunger but also boosts the retention rate of participating undergraduates.&#13;

A new study suggests that enrolling students in CalFresh&#8212;the state's food assistance program for low-income residents&#8212;not only addresses student hunger but also boosts the retention rate of participating undergraduates.</p>
<p>Researchers found that UC Santa Cruz first- and second-year undergraduates who enroll in CalFresh as part of <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/index.html">Slug Support</a>, the campus's basic-needs program, were more likely to return to campus the following fall than their counterparts who didn't enroll. The study was conducted by Rebecca London, an assistant professor of sociology, and Brandon Balzer Carr, a doctoral student in psychology.</p>
<p>The first-year retention rate for CalFresh enrollees hit 94%, only slightly higher than the overall retention rate of 92%&#8212;but substantially higher than the 87% rate of students who participate in Slug Support without enrolling in CalFresh. The pattern holds for second-year students, as well, according to London.</p>
<p>This new evidence that improving food security also improves student academic outcomes is welcome and timely news, said London.</p>
<p>"Governor Newsom's proposed budget includes $18.5 million to address hunger and housing in the UC system," she said. "Now we know that type of support also helps keep students on the path to completing their degrees."</p>
<p>Given the results, London hopes policymakers and university leaders will consider making it easier for students to enroll in CalFresh, boosting student awareness of their eligibility, and adopting other measures to increase participation. About one-third of UCSC students qualify for the state's Educational Opportunity Program (EOP), which makes them eligible for CalFresh.</p>
<p>London and Balzer Carr conducted the research through a partnership with Slug Support and the Student Success Equity Research Center in the Division of Student Success. London and Carr <a href="https://www.ppic.org/blog/food-assistance-linked-to-student-success-in-college/?utm_source=ppic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=blog_subscriber">coauthored a post</a> about their findings on the Public Policy Institute of California's blog; London is an adjunct fellow at the institute.</p>

<p>A video by Distinguished Professor of Psychology Barbara Rogoff is featured in the "<a href="https://stemforall2019.videohall.com/">2019 STEM for All Video Showcase</a>," a competition hosted by the National Science Foundation (NSF).</p>
<p>Rogoff and co-presenters Luc&#237;a Alcal&#225; and Omar Ruvalcaba, both of whom earned doctorates in psychology from UC Santa Cruz, created a 3-minute research video entitled "Collaboration as an Ensemble." They submitted it as part of NSF's annual competition showcasing innovative projects that seek to improve learning and teaching in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics&#8212;the so-called STEM fields.</p>
<p>The video, set in California, highlights the sophisticated, fluid collaboration of U.S. Mexican-heritage children, whom the researchers found collaborate twice as much as their middle-class European American classmates in tasks like computer programming and route planning.</p>
<p>"The Mexican-heritage children&#8217;s collaboration was so well coordinated that they often seemed like one organism with four arms," said Rogoff. Changing classroom practices to make use of these children&#8217;s skillful ways of working together could help to broaden children&#8217;s participation in science, according to the researchers.</p>
<p>Rogoff's video is available for voting through May 20 as part of NSF's annual competition; viewers are invited to <a href="https://stemforall2019.videohall.com/p/1346">vote for their favorite video</a> and join an online discussion about the videos.</p>
<p>Videos from Rogoff&#8217;s research team have taken top public awards in the previous three years; the videos remain available for viewing online on the NSF STEM for All Video Showcase site.</p>
<p>Now in its fifth year, the NSF showcase features over 240 projects this year. The videos highlight initiatives for students of all ages, kindergarten through graduate school, as well as for adult learners.</p>

This is influenced by high housing costs, the prevalence of seasonal, low-paying wages, and more. Growing up in poverty especially hurts children &#8211; adversely impacting their development, health, and economic mobility throughout their lifetimes.</p>
<p>The problems are very real, but there&#8217;s good news &#8211; things are improving every single day, thanks to difference-makers like you who are an active part of the solution through UC Santa Cruz United Way of Santa Cruz County&#8217;s Annual Giving Campaign! This is about changing lives by creating opportunities. From helping homeless youth get the chance for a family and future, or connecting youth to mental health services &#8211; United Way is investing in change that lasts right here in our local communities.</p>
<p>Through their <a href="https://www.unitedwaysc.org/community-resources">Community Resources</a> United Way serves UCSC students and staff with programs such as 211, Emergency Food and Shelter and the Stuff the Bus program which provided 200 backpacks to Cabrillo and UCSC students last year.</p>
<p>How can you help? By finding your charitable passion and becoming a change-maker! Last year, employees gave&#160;<strong>$30,000</strong>&#160;which made the entire campus proud and our communities a better place to live, work, and raise our families. Here&#8217;s how to get started to make this year even more successful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give now via credit card or through payroll deduction: <a href="https://www.unitedwaysc.org/ucsc">https://www.unitedwaysc.org/ucsc</a></li>
<li>Make your pledge to the United Way&#8217;s Youth Well-Being Fund</li>
<li>Consider joining United Way Leadership Groups to connect with others who care about creating a healthy, thriving Santa Cruz County</li>

We&#8217;ve had a strong recycling program in place for nearly 30 years, and we&#8217;re striving to achieve Zero Waste by 2020.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But a new challenge has arisen that will take a little extra effort on our part to overcome. Our campus recycling is temporarily being landfilled due to high rates of contamination, with the highest rates in our residential and dining halls.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Recycling is contaminated when non-recyclable items like trash (think greasy pizza boxes) or compostable material like food scraps or to-go coffee cups and bioware from campus cafes are incorrectly tossed into recycling bins, which essentially sends all the contents to the landfill.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>We need your help in fixing the problem. Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to help combat this issue:&#160;</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Keep your recyclables loose! Recyclables disposed of in a plastic bag are not recycled!</li>
<li>Avoid the urge to &#8220;wish-cycle.&#8221; We &#8220;wish-cycle&#8221; when we guess, hope or wish an item is recyclable, then toss it into a recycling bin. If you are unsure if something is recyclable, it is better to throw it into the landfill bin!</li>
<li>Watch and share this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18hVf6hs0Jf73kbwss5UEsS_X1NcrWuCT/view" rel="noopener" target="_blank">informational video</a> to learn how to recycle right on campus!&#160;</li>
<li>Follow the student Zero Waste Team's social media content on Facebook (UCSC Zero Waste) and Instagram (@ucsczerowaste) for great recycling tips.</li>
</ul>
</div>

She is a career public defender currently assigned to the Homicide Division at the Santa Clara County Alternate Defender where she specializes in capital litigation.<br/></span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz has joined forces with Bookshop Santa Cruz and the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music to present <em>My Own Words: The Law &amp; Legacy of RBG</em>--a panel discussion and Community Read kickoff event--on May 22 at the DNA Comedy Lab.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Distinguished Professor of Feminist Studies<strong> Bettina Aptheker</strong> will moderate a conversation with <strong>Judge Syda Cogliati</strong>, <strong>Attorney Anna M. Penrose-Levig</strong>, and <strong>Attorney</strong> <strong>Jessica Delgado</strong> about the significant cases and opinions Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has championed over the course of her career, as well as the impact she has had on women's equality, civil liberties, and racial justice under the law.</p>
<p>The event takes place in anticipation of the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music's upcoming premiere of a major new work inspired by the life of Ginsburg, <em>When There Are Nine, </em>by composer Kristin Kuster. (&#8220;When There Are Nine&#8221; is a statement Justice Ginsberg made when asked when there would be enough women on the Supreme Court).</p>
<p>At the same time, Bookshop Santa Cruz is also honoring the publication of Ginsberg&#8217;s book, <em>My Own Words</em>, edited by two law professors at Georgetown.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will share excerpts from the book, details of Justice&#160;Ginsberg&#8217;s life, and a few of the specific cases that are most foundational to women&#8217;s equality, voting rights, and racial justice,&#8221; said Aptheker. &#8220;We&#8217;ll also talk about the ways in which race, class, gender, and sexuality are intertwined in both law and sites of political engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aptheker noted that Ginsburg developed brilliant legal strategies in the early 1970s when she was head of the ACLU Women&#8217;s&#160;Commission, working to advance&#160;women&#8217;s equality before the law by using the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to prohibit sex&#160;discrimination.</p>
<p>Appointed by President Clinton to the Supreme Court in 1994, Ginsburg has since been a&#160;tireless defender of equality in all matters including racial justice, civil liberties, voting rights, and reproductive rights for women.</p>
<p><strong>In recent weeks</strong>, both Georgia and Alabama have passed unprecedented legislation banning abortion in those states. Aptheker described the implications of these new laws for the Supreme Court and the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;The appointment of&#160;Gorsuch and Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme&#160;Court by President Trump, with the very close votes in the U.S. Senate confirmation hearings, cemented what is intended to be a conservative majority on the court,&#8221; said Aptheker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Likewise, and just as serious, is the over 100 appointments rammed through the Republican-controlled Senate since Trump came into office of very conservative justices on the federal courts--nearly 100% of whom are white, and&#160;almost all men, and were appointed on advice from the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy, which has, as its expressed purpose, a conservative and libertarian corrective to what it perceives as liberal control of the courts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Trump came into office the courts have been&#160;increasingly politicized, and made partisan&#160;corridors in a way wholly violative of the Constitutions&#8217; separation of powers,&#8221; Aptheker added. &#8220;It is hard to predict how the Supreme Court may rule since it is widely speculated that&#160;Chief Justice Roberts may be a swing vote in certain cases, but for the time being the Court is pretty much split 5-4 as regards voting rights, reproductive rights, LBGT rights, and a host of other related kinds of issues.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Two UC Santa Cruz alumnae</strong> will be among those joining Aptheker for the panel discussion.</p>
<p>Judge Syda Coglia graduated from UC Santa Cruz and UC Hastings College of the Law and has been a member of the State Bar of California since 1994. She served as a&#160;senior appellate research attorney at the Sixth District Court of Appeal before being elected to the Santa Cruz Superior Court bench in 2018.</p>
<p>Jessica Delgado graduated from UC Santa Cruz and Berkeley Law. She is now a career public defender currently assigned to the Homicide Division at the Santa Clara County Alternate Defender where she specializes in capital litigation.</p>
<p>Aptheker said she hopes that people come away from the event with a renewed sense of community, purpose and hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things we are planning is for those who wish to, we will have materials available to make&#160;&#8216;dissent collars&#8217; similar to those worn by Justice Ginsberg in her dissenting opinions, and write on their own collars whatever they wish. We also intend to honor the other women presently on the court who are amazing in their own right--Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and Justice Elena Kagan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On a personal note: I grew up in Brooklyn, New York, as did Justice Ginsberg, and in reading her biographical stories I was struck by how similar our experiences were, especially of sexism, even though I am 10 years younger than she is,&#8221; Aptheker added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that folks will come to understand in a better way just what it was like for women and girls when we were growing up, and how far the women&#8217;s liberation movement, the civil rights and voting rights movements, and the LGBT movement have taken us. Justice Ginsberg has been an unparalleled&#160;architect of equality before the law, following in the profound civil rights legacy of Justice Thurgood Marshall.&#8221;</p>

Larive as the eleventh chancellor of UC Santa Cruz. Currently the provost and executive vice chancellor at UC Riverside, Larive has served the UC community for nearly a decade and a half as a faculty member, administrator and leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am deeply humbled, honored, and excited to lead UC Santa Cruz &#8212; a campus of the university I love and am greatly indebted to,&#8221; said Larive, who received her PhD in analytical chemistry from UC Riverside. &#8220;As a first-generation college student, I experienced firsthand the capacity of higher education institutions &#8211; and that of UC in particular &#8211; to level the playing field for all students, regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds, and to positively transform their lives and their futures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larive has worked to expand educational opportunity and student success throughout her 14-year tenure at UC Riverside. During this time, the campus closed the gap in graduation rates between Pell grant and non-Pell grant students, while raising overall degree-completion rates and diversifying the student body and faculty. As the chief academic officer, Larive boosted UC Riverside&#8217;s progress toward enrolling one California community college transfer student for every two resident freshmen. She also oversaw the creation of academic support and peer mentoring programs to help ensure transfer student success. As chair of the first mathematics task force, Larive helped catalyze curriculum changes and boost improvements in student success with critical gateway math courses. <a href="https://leadership.ucsc.edu/announcements/ucop/">Read more.</a></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c7e911da8072701734bebd3c6e7e2314"><name>temporary-university-house</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Regents approve lease for temporary university house</title><summary>With the current University House deemed uninhabitable, UC President Janet Napolitano recommended that a property be rented near the main campus to house the incoming chancellor and host small dinners and events for fundraising and celebrating faculty and student success until University House is rebuilt.&#13;

Larive, who starts on July 1.</p>
<p>The UC Regents approved the lease on Thursday. UC Regents Policy 7708 requires that the university provide housing for chancellors.</p>
<p>With the current University House deemed uninhabitable, UC President Janet Napolitano recommended that a property be rented near the main campus to house the incoming chancellor and host small dinners and events for fundraising and celebrating faculty and student success until University House is rebuilt.</p>
<p>The 2,800 square-foot house is about two miles from campus and will cost $6,700 a month. The campus conducted a broad search of available properties by reviewing current listings and contacting local property management companies to find trhe most appropriate rental. The campus also retained an outside expert to evaluate the market and confirm pricing was fair and in alignment with market rate.</p>
<p>University House, built in 1967 on campus, was closed in 2015 due to structural and life/safety code deficiencies. In a seismic safety review, the facility received a poor rating which implies a &#8220;severe&#8221; risk to life and safety. Additional studies have revealed additional structural problems&#8212;such as dry rot&#8212;as well as accessibility and other building code deficiencies.</p>

<p>This new campus program is separate from the broader CITRIS Core Seed Funding initiative, which funds collaborative research between the four CITRIS campuses. The campus program focuses on strengthening interdisciplinary connections on the UC Santa Cruz campus. It will provide funding up to $40,000 for teams of at least two principal investigators from different divisions on campus.</p>
<p>"We've started this new UC Santa Cruz campus seed funding program in order to forge new research relationships across divisions, in line with our mission of solving societal problems with information technology solutions," said J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, director of CITRIS and the Banatao Institute at UC Santa Cruz. "We also envision it helping develop ideas that can lead to larger grants and other funding and are committed to supporting CITRIS PIs here on campus through that process."</p>
<p>Online and in-person information sessions for potential applicants will be held in early June. Dates and details will be posted on the Campus Seed Funding web page at <a href="http://citris.sites.ucsc.edu/ucsc-campus-seed-funding/">citris.sites.ucsc.edu/ucsc-campus-seed-funding</a>.</p>

<p>Under the&#160;<a href="https://millionledchallenge.com">Million Light Bulb Challenge</a> community buy program supported by UC's Carbon Neutrality Initiative, all UC students, staff, faculty and alumni can <a href="https://all-phasemillionlamps.com/purchase/">purchase light bulbs at nearly half the price</a> of online competitors. The program launched in 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;High-quality LED light sources help reduce our carbon footprint, reduce our energy use, and save money,&#8221; said UC President Janet Napolitano. &#8220;We are excited to launch this challenge and swap out at least a million inefficient light sources.&#8221;</p>
<h3>About the challenge</h3>
<p>Inspired by research conducted by the California Lighting Technology Center at UC Davis, the UC Office of the President spearheaded the Million Light Bulb Challenge to procure high-quality, energy-efficient light sources as part of UC's goal of reaching operational carbon neutrality by 2025. UC is collaborating with the California Community College system, the California State University system and the California Department of General Services in this large-scale effort. The collaborative is working with employees at all campus buildings and is providing a new community-buy program.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e1137b7a8072701734bebd3cb8ef8bd8"><name>our-new-chancellor</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Our new chancellor</title><summary>I am delighted to see the appointment of Cindy Larive, campus provost and executive vice chancellor at UC Riverside, as our new chancellor.</summary><start-date>1557990000000</start-date><display-name>Our new chancellor</display-name><path>/2019/05/our-new-chancellor</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/05/our-new-chancellor</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1558554310748</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1558554310748</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I am delighted to see the appointment of Cindy Larive, campus provost and executive vice chancellor at UC Riverside, as our new chancellor.

<p>Batalha, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, served as the scientific lead for NASA's highly successful Kepler mission, which discovered more than 2,500 planets around other stars. On the Kepler mission, she identified planets that might be able to sustain life and led the analysis that yielded the discovery in 2011 of the first confirmed rocky planet outside our solar system. In 2017, <em>Time</em> magazine named her among the 100 most influential people in the world. She received the UCSC Alumni Achievement Award in 2018 and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2019.</p>
<p>After the Kepler space telescope retired in October 2018, Batalha left NASA to join the faculty at UC Santa Cruz, returning to where she had received her Ph.D. in astrophysics in 1997. She continues to study planets orbiting other stars in the galaxy, investigating questions of planetary habitability and searching for evidence of life beyond the solar system.</p>
This lecture is presented as part of the Mandel Lecture Series, which promotes public awareness and appreciation for astronomy.

<p>"<a href="https://youtu.be/YSWd21z2qqE">Loose Ends: String Theory and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory</a>" is one of the festival's "Big Ideas" programs in which leading scientists explore some of the most complex scientific questions about our origins, our fundamental nature, and our place in the cosmos. Joining Dine on the panel will be three other leading theoretical physicists: Lara Anderson from Virginia Tech, Marcelo Gleiser from Dartmouth College, and Andrew Strominger from Harvard University. Columbia University theoretical physicist Brian Greene will moderate the discussion.</p>
<p>Greene co-founded the World Science Festival in 2008 with his wife, journalist Tracy Day. The festival celebrates science with original programming that includes discourse, debate, theatre, film, workshops, and interactive installations. It opened this year on May 22 with a performance of "Light Falls: Space, Time and an Obsession of Einstein," which will be <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/light-falls">broadcast on PBS</a> on Wednesday, May 29, the 100th anniversary of Einstein&#8217;s general theory of relativity being confirmed through astronomical observations.</p>
<p>String theory took physics by storm about 35 years ago, promising a unified theory of the forces of nature, something Einstein had pursued without success. Research on string theory has brought a collection of mind-boggling possibilities into the lexicon of mainstream thinking&#8212;extra dimensions of space, holographic worlds, and multiple universes. Some researchers view these developments as symptoms of string theory having lost its way. Others argue that string theory, although very much still a work in progress, is revealing stunning new qualities of reality. Dine and his fellow panelists will delve into the past and future of string theory, debating what it can tell us about the search for a unified theory.</p>
<p>Dine, who is affiliated with the <a href="http://scipp.ucsc.edu/">Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP)</a>, is noted for his work in cosmology, particle physics, and string theory. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences, he won the Sakurai Prize of the American Physical Society in 2017. He is writing a book on the big questions currently confronting particle physicists and cosmologists.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="eaf7ea9a8072701734bebd3cf747b9e1"><name>rubin-chair-investiture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz appointed to endowed chair for diversity in astronomy </title><summary>The May 22 investiture ceremony honored Ramirez-Ruiz as the inaugural holder of the Vera Rubin Presidential Chair for Diversity in Astronomy.</summary><start-date>1558681200000</start-date><display-name>Astronomer Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz appointed to endowed chair for diversity in astronomy </display-name><path>/2019/05/rubin-chair-investiture</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/05/rubin-chair-investiture</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1558720276344</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1558729865662</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Appointments</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/sandy-enrico-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/sandy-enrico-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sandy-enrico-400.jpg</name><display-name>sandy-enrico-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>77601</file-size><width>400</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Sandra Faber and Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/sandy-enrico-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/sandy-enrico-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sandy-enrico-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sandy-enrico-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20788</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sandra Faber and Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Sandra Faber and Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz at the Rubin Chair investiture ceremony.

<p>The chair was created in 2018 to advance the cause of diversity, equity, and inclusive excellence in astronomy. It is named for the distinguished astronomer Vera Rubin (1928-2016), who was a champion of inclusivity in science and a beloved mentor for younger women and for dozens of astronomers from varied backgrounds.</p>
<p>Sandra Faber, a professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics who helped establish the chair, said Rubin was an important mentor for her. "She was an incredible role model, and it was a terrific learning experience for me to see how she did science," Faber said.</p>
<p>Vera Rubin's son David, a researcher in Earth and Planetary Sciences at UC Santa Cruz, also spoke at the investiture. "Our family is very happy that there is a chair named after our mom, and I couldn't imagine a better place for it than UC Santa Cruz," he said.</p>
<p>Faber noted that the Rubin Chair is different from most endowed chairs in the way its funds are intended to be used. "The point is that the person in the chair uses the funds for the good of diversity in the department," she said.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz has worked vigorously to support the promotion and retention of women and people from under-represented groups in astronomy and related fields. He established and directs the <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/lamat/">Lamat program</a>, which gives undergraduate students the opportunity to work with UC Santa Cruz faculty and graduate students on computational astrophysics projects. The Lamat program has helped double the number of Latinos enrolling in the country's top astronomy graduate programs, he said.</p>
<p>With the funds from the Rubin Chair, Ramirez-Ruiz said he will continue working to support students at all levels and give them opportunities to develop as scientists and leaders. He is working to broaden the Lamat program to give it a greater emphasis on developing students' data science skills, and he wants to build on the <a href="https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/academics/Osterbrock/index.html">Osterbrock Leadership Program</a> for astronomy graduate students to empower more graduate students to take on leadership roles.</p>
<p>"Our department has made impressive progress in promoting diversity at both the undergraduate and graduate levels," he said. "Starting next fall, 50 percent of our graduate students will be from under-represented groups. I'm confident we have a great group of people, and now we need to support them."</p>
<p><strong>Excellence and diversity intertwined</strong></p>
<p>Increased diversity creates opportunities to learn from a wide range of perspectives, Ramirez-Ruiz said, adding that working with diverse students has made him a better scientist. "Excellence and diversity are intertwined," he said. "My most creative work has been done with students. Intellectual diversity leads to creative solutions to problems."</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz said his department has more National Science Foundation graduate fellowship recipients than any other astronomy department in the country, and the third largest number of prize postdoctoral fellowships awarded to its students in the past decade, while at the same time earning recognition from the American Astronomical Society with the highest diversity ranking score in the country.</p>
<p>Noting that he would like to see more people of color in faculty and leadership positions, Ramirez-Ruiz said he is proud of the work the astronomy department has done to address the "pipeline issue" by recruiting talented students from under-represented groups. But there is significantly more work to be done, he said.</p>
<p>"We want our students to be as prepared as possible, so wherever they go they will feel empowered," he said. "I love to see alumni from our department populating the field as faculty members, and I know that as they advance in their careers they will be invested in mentoring others."</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz is a theoretical astrophysicist whose research explores the violent and capricious nature of the universe. He uses computer simulations to study transient phenomena such as collisions, mergers, and disruptions of stars, and his work is essential to interpreting the results of gravitational wave detections. Since joining the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2007, he has earned numerous awards and honors, including a Packard Fellowship, a Niels Bohr Professorship, and most recently the 2019 HEAD Mid-Career Prize from the American Astronomical Society.</p>

<p>Organized by Feminist Studies professors Karen Barad and Felicity Amaya Schaeffer, the event will feature three keynote speakers and a graduate student panel, plus a tour of the Arboretum with director Rick Flores, who is currently working on a plant restoration project in collaboration with the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band.</p>
<p>The guest speakers will address the politics of climate change and the consequences of the uneven distribution of its effects.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conference foregrounds the urgency and potentiality of thinking together about how to care for rather than manage the earth,&#8221; said Barad. &#8220;Despite some contemporary arguments concerning the Anthropocene, the earth is not simply an object in need of managerial and scientific prowess."</p>
<p>"It is in this context, and by following an ethics and practice of thinking together, that our esteemed speakers will think with us about how indigenous and non-indigenous thought can articulate a different approach to climate justice--namely one that attends to the complexities and uneven distribution of responsibility and precarity.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Barad described the difference between environmental justice and climate justice, noting that the latter also considers the mix of ecological, cultural, social, political, geological, legal, and biological forces.</p>
<p>&#8220;While &#8216;environmental justice&#8217; is without doubt an important field of inquiry and activism, its focus on the development and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations nevertheless rests on anthropocentric, that is, human-centered notions for what the term &#8216;environment&#8217; denotes and the reasons for which it has to be protected,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Climate Justice, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of taking the entanglement of various, simultaneously occurring, and mutually constitutive forces into consideration. It is not simply the effect of a wrong decision, or of the overuse of a singular resource, or the change in temperature, or the raise of conflicts based on food and water scarcity in areas now too dry to grow wheat, or the mismanagement of monetary flow. Rather it is all the above and more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barad added that the speakers at the conference will discuss why it is important to have collaborations between indigenous and non-indigenous approaches to climate change?</p>
<p>&#8220;Indigenous thinkers and indigenous thought have their own concepts and histories which don&#8217;t rely on Western ideas of &#8216;environment,&#8217; passive landscapes, or the alleged superiority of humans who are to single-handedly shape and manage the earth,&#8221; said Barad.</p>
<p>&#8220;The differences in the histories of indigenous and non-indigenous thought and care for the earth are not an obstacle but the very potential of thinking together about alternative notions of climate justice. It allows us to collaboratively address the urgent questions at stake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we hope that people will take away from this event is what will also bring us all together for this event--namely, the shared concern of finding ways to think about climate justice differently and to respond to the challenges of collaborative engagements between Indigenous and non-Indigenous approaches to caring for the Earth,&#8221; she added.</p>

Abnormal activation of FoxM1 is a common feature of cancer cells and is correlated with poor prognosis, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Now researchers at UC Santa Cruz have determined the structure of this protein--a kind of "master switch" for cell division--in its inactive or "off" conformation. This new understanding of the structure of FoxM1 could ultimately be used to design new drugs that stabilize the protein in its inactive state and thereby stop the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells.</p>
<p>Seth Rubin, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, explained that FoxM1 is a "transcription factor," a protein that controls the activity of specific genes.</p>
<p>"When a cell is going to divide, there are a bunch of proteins that need to be made, and FoxM1 controls all the genes for those proteins," Rubin said. "Because cancer cells are proliferating and dividing all the time, they need to activate FoxM1, so it has long been a target for drug development."</p>
<p>The new study involved a close collaboration between Rubin's lab and that of Nikolaos Sgourakis, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry. After determining the structure of the protein in the "off" state, the team then figured out how it switches from the inhibited conformation to the activated or "on" state. The researchers <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46131">published their findings May 28 in the journal <em>eLife</em></a>.</p>
<p>The study revealed that two separate domains of the FoxM1 protein interact and bind together in the inhibited conformation. The study also showed that the two domains separate and lose their structure when the protein is activated. Most proteins fold into an orderly three-dimensional structure that is key to their function, but some proteins function as disordered linear molecules with no particular 3D structure.</p>
<p>"One thing a disordered state is good at is interacting with other proteins," Rubin said. "With FoxM1, the inactive state is all folded up on itself. When it gets activated it becomes disordered, and then it can recruit the other proteins needed to turn on gene expression. That's something that hasn't been seen before, and it may be a general mechanism for how transcription factors switch from the off state to the active state."</p>
<p>It was known from previous studies that FoxM1 is activated by kinase enzymes, which add phosphoryl groups to specific sites on the protein. Rubin's team found that phosphorylation of FoxM1 at one particular site causes the dissociation of the two domains and that both domains then become structurally disordered.</p>
<p>"Knowing the structure of the inhibited state of the protein really opens up a pathway to search for compounds that can stabilize it," Rubin said. "And beyond drug development, in terms of the understanding of how transcription factors work, the discovery of this transition from an ordered to a disordered state is an important advance."</p>
<p>The determination of the structure was not easy, he said. The researchers used a technique called NMR spectroscopy, taking advantage of a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/04/nmr-facility.html">powerful new instrument</a> at the UC Santa Cruz NMR Facility. Rubin's initial work on FoxM1 was funded by a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/cancer-research-grants.html">grant from the Santa Cruz Cancer Benefit Group</a>. The new study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the American Cancer Society, and Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation.</p>

<p>Nojan, a PhD candidate in sociology at UC Santa Cruz, has been selected as a 2019-20 fellow of the <a href="https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/">University of California National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement</a>.</p>
<p>As one of only 11 fellows selected from a highly competitive pool of nominees from across the country, Nojan will spend a year at the forefront of efforts to examine free speech and enhance civic engagement. She joins a class of fellows that includes lawyers, journalists, social scientists, and other experts.</p>
<p>Each fellow will spend 12 months researching questions related to the First Amendment. Nojan will conduct a UC-wide study of Muslim students to assess the level of their civic engagement, their use of free speech practices, and the extent to which campus climate inhibits or encourages their participation in the life of the campus. She plans to conduct in-depth, in-person interviews with Muslim students at each of the 10 UC campuses, and to interview staff and administrators to assess the level of resources that are available on each campus.</p>
<p>"There's been a contentious climate for Muslim students for almost two decades, and some would say since the Cold War," said Nojan, noting that then-UC President Mark Yudof commissioned a study in 2012 to examine the experiences of Arab and Muslim students across the UC system. That<a href="https://cascholars4academicfreedom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/muslim-arab-student-climate-report-final.pdf"> study</a> revealed that students felt they were treated with suspicion and mistrust by administrators, and that they were among the least-respected groups on campus.</p>
<p>"This study motivated me," said Nojan. "It found that Muslim students were feeling disrespected, not just by other students but by administrators. It pointed to a structural problem I wanted to look into."</p>
<p>Nojan's project, "Examining Free Speech and Civic Engagement Among UC Muslim Students: What Role Does Campus Safety Play?," will build on previous studies, including the systemwide <a href="http://campusclimate.ucop.edu/index.html">Campus Climate Survey</a> that is administered periodically on all UC campuses. Those survey results leave Nojan wanting to know more. The survey doesn't look into issues of free speech and is "quite limited in terms of the sense of belonging students feel. Involvement is limited only to student organizations," she said.</p>
<p>Nojan is eager to explore more deeply questions of safety, belonging, and the overall university experience of Muslim students.</p>
<p>Noting studies that suggest "Islamophobia exists in the classroom," she expressed concern about Muslim students' ability to speak freely in class.</p>
<p>"There are definitely cases where students feel unsafe expressing political dissent in the current climate," she said. "The university is inclusive and tolerant of diverse views and free speech, but in this political climate, does that really apply?"</p>
<p>Nojan will investigate how levels of physical, psychological, and emotional safety may shape students engagement on campus. "I'm open to all different kinds of safety," she noted.</p>
<p>Before she reaches out to students on the 10 UC campuses, Nojan will analyze the results of previous UC student-experience surveys to identify trends and patterns, including which groups feel the most unsafe, who experiences the greatest sense of belonging, and who rates campus climate as highly respectful. From there, she will advertise widely, tap established student networks, and utilize informal associations to recruit participants for her study. "I want to get a range of engagement, because it's important to hear from students who aren't engaged or part of a student organization, too," she said.</p>
<p>Nojan, who earned a master's in education from UCSC in 2017, hopes that her systemwide study will shed light on what each campus is doing well, what campuses can learn from each other, and opportunities to share resources. She also hopes to identify concrete actions that campuses can take to support free speech and encourage civic engagement for Muslim students. "Personally and professionally, that's my way of doing research," she said.</p>
<p>Veronica Terriquez, associate professor of sociology and one of Nojan's advisers, was happy to recommend her for the fellowship.</p>
<p>"Saugher is committed to conducting high-quality research," said Terriquez. "Given her close connection to the Muslim community and her experience promoting the well-being and sense of belonging among diverse students, she is well-prepared to lead this project. I expect her findings will be of value to universities and other institutions that want to be more inclusive of young people from a range of backgrounds."</p>
<p><a href="https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/fellows-19-20/">Other 2019-20 fellows</a> include Emerson Sykes, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union; Spoma Jovanovic, professor of communication studies at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro; Jonathan Friedman, director of PEN America&#8217;s Campus Speech Project; and Rebecca MacKinnon, director of Ranking Digital Rights at New America.</p>
<p>The Washington, D.C.-based <a href="https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/">UC National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement</a> was established to explore "how the fundamental democratic principles of free speech and civic engagement must adapt to the challenges and opportunities of modern society." Its mission is to defend and advance these values through research, advocacy, debate, and discussion.</p>

<p>Brodsky has been elected as a GSA Fellow in recognition of her distinguished contributions to the geosciences, and she was also chosen as the 2019 recipient of the GSA's George P. Woollard Award, given annually to recognize outstanding contributions to geology through the application of the principles and techniques of geophysics. As part of the award, she will give a talk at the 2019 GSA meeting in Phoenix in September.</p>
<p>Brodsky was also chosen to give the annual Beno Gutenberg Lecture at the AGU Fall Meeting in Washington, D.C., in December. The Gutenberg Lecture, part of the AGU's Bowie Lecture Series, honors the life and work of the renowned seismologist Beno Gutenberg, who directed the Seismological Laboratory at Caltech and made important contributions to earthquake seismology. Brodsky's lecture, titled "The Earthquake Problem," will highlight the multiplicity of approaches that must be brought to bear on studying earthquakes.</p>
<p>Brodsky studies the mechanics underlying earthquakes, addressing questions about the processes that trigger earthquakes and the constraining forces and processes that occur inside a fault zone during slip. Her recent work includes important findings about earthquakes induced by human activities in which fluids are injected deep underground (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, wastewater disposal, and geothermal wells). After the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake off the coast of Japan, Brodsky helped organize and lead a major international expedition to study the fault. In addition to her research on earthquakes, she also studies the seismology of volcanoes, landslides, glaciers, and rivers.</p>
<p>An AGU Fellow, Brodsky was awarded the AGU's James Macelwane Medal in 2008. In 2005, the Seismological Society of America recognized her with the inaugural Charles Richter Early Career Award. She earned her bachelor's degree at Harvard University and her Ph.D. at Caltech, and she joined the UCSC faculty in 2005.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="097cb6628072701734bebd3cf7ae200e"><name>alumni-excursion</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Excursion: Sea change, up close and personal</title><summary>A curated trip called "The Effects of Climate Change on Marine Life" offered attendees a detailed look into how UC Santa Cruz researchers are contributing to the discussion of climate change and its direct impact on marine ecosystems. </summary><start-date>1559199600000</start-date><display-name>Alumni Excursion</display-name><path>/2019/05/alumni-excursion</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/05/alumni-excursion</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1559232295733</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1559249483267</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Mary Elizabeth Garcia</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/alumni-excursion-group-photo.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/alumni-excursion-group-photo.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alumni-excursion-group-photo.jpg</name><display-name>alumni-excursion-group-photo.jpg</display-name><file-size>133131</file-size><width>450</width><height>299</height></image><image-alt>Alumni Excursion Group Photo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/alumni-excursion-thumbnail-v2.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/alumni-excursion-thumbnail-v2.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alumni-excursion-thumbnail-v2.jpg</name><display-name>alumni-excursion-thumbnail-v2.jpg</display-name><file-size>2509</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alumni Excursion Group Photo Thumbnail</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Group photo taken in Moss Landing before the whale-watching tour had begun.

They were treated to behind-the-scenes tours and first-hand looks at research. They hiked along coastal bluffs to catch glimpses of seals as big as cars. </span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was all a part of a first for UC Santa Cruz Alumni Excursions, a set of curated events intended to expand knowledge on particular topics. </span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sustainability-minded Banana Slugs returned to UC Santa Cruz during Alumni Weekend to attend the first excursion. The trip, called &#8220;The Effects of Climate Change on Marine Life,&#8221; offered a glimpse into how UC Santa Cruz researchers are contributing to the discussion of climate change and its effects on marine ecosystems. Over a span of three days, participants engaged in selected marine activities and academic talks on the topic of climate change.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;A lot of alumni are interested in continuing education after college, and I wanted to see more interaction between UC Santa Cruz faculty and alumni,&#8221; said Alumni Council member Blair Gifford (Rachel Carson '78, economics), who helped design the excursion. The activities focused on climate change and its devastating effects on the Central Coast region, an issue that is very close to many alumni hearts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The excursion kicked off on Wednesday, April 24, with a talk by Gary Griggs, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. Griggs made a compelling case for why we should care about climate change and gave details on the daunting truth that lies before us: Unless we take serious measures to curb climate change, our planet will soon begin to dissipate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first full day of events began with a whale-watching tour in Monterey Bay. All 18 participants were transported to Moss Landing, where they then hopped on a boat, ate ginger cookies to help ward off seasickness, and set out into the fog. Logan Pallin, a second-year Ph.D. student in ecology and evolutionary biology, led the group on the whale-watching tour and discussed his work with the Friedlander Lab. Pallin&#8217;s work focuses on analyzing whale tissue to better understand the effects of climate change on marine mammals. He recounted the lab&#8217;s work of tracking down whales by boat and collecting tissue samples for a test they developed.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After hearing from Pallin and communing with the whales and birds out on the open waters, the crew headed to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), located in the Moss Landing harbor, to hear from senior scientist Ken Johnson. Johnson&#8217;s lab at MBARI is dedicated to measuring the vitals of the ocean with advanced technology. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once the events in Moss Landing completed, the group then traveled farther south to receive a special behind-the-scenes tour of the world-famous Monterey Bay Aquarium.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The last day of events involved the trip attendees traveling north of Santa Cruz to&#160;<span>A&#241;o</span> Nuevo Natural Reserve for a hiking tour led by reserve director Patrick Robinson (Rachel Carson College '03, marine biology), who spoke about the research being done by UC Santa Cruz and collaborating institutions from around the world. The hiking trail meandered along the coastal bluffs, offering great views of the dozens of elephant seals that travel to those bluffs during mating season.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Intrepid alumni from all over the country joined the excursion. The trip also attracted non-UC Santa Cruz alumni. Dwayne and Linda Downing of Soquel attended the event to learn more about the current research happening at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We&#8217;ve been reading articles written by Gary Griggs at UC Santa Cruz for years,&#8221; said Dwayne. He and Linda share an interest in natural sciences and thought the trip would be an excellent opportunity to tour the marine ecosystem with preeminent researchers as guides, while learning about the effects of climate change in their coastal community. </span>&#160;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through the blending of academic talks and hands-on experience, &#8220;The Effects of Climate Change on Marine Life&#8221; provided its participants with the opportunity to see firsthand how UC Santa Cruz is tackling climate change and preserving the natural habitat for marine life, hoping to inspire its participants to continue conservation efforts at the individual level, as well as working toward greater climate change advocacy in the community. </span></p>

<p>Greek letter organizations are affiliated with the campus as student organizations. Our action means Theta Chi is no longer recognized by our university and is no longer eligible to organize or recruit members.</p>
<p>The investigation revealed deeply appalling behavior&#8212;hazing, drug use, and more&#8212;that does not represent the values of our university. We have dismissed one member of Theta Chi and several others may face serious discipline. We also have notified the group&#8217;s national organization of our findings, and the organization has revoked the chapter&#8217;s charter. The chapter had been on an interim suspension during our investigation.</p>
<p>Our deepest condolences go out to the student&#8217;s family and friends for their unimaginable loss and for the terrible circumstances that surrounded his death.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has zero-tolerance for hazing, which is at odds with our community values and against campus policy.

<p>Matera is one of 81 new ACLS Fellows who were selected by their peers from over 1,100 applicants nationwide to receive support for their research and writing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 2019 ACLS Fellows exemplify ACLS&#8217;s inclusive vision of excellence in the humanities and humanistic social sciences,&#8221; noted Matthew Goldfeder, director of fellowship programs at ACLS.</p>
<p>&#8220;The awardees, who hail from more than 60 colleges and universities, were selected for their potential to make an original and significant contribution to knowledge,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are working at diverse types of institutions, on research projects that span antiquity to the present, in contexts around the world, and the array of disciplines and methodologies represented demonstrates the vitality and the incredible breadth of humanistic scholarship today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matera will use the award to work on his upcoming book, <em>The African Grounds of Race Relations in Britain</em>.</p>
<p>The project is a history of the process by which race relations became a useful framework for reckoning with the prospect of decolonization in the British empire and for managing its economic effects in particular.</p>
<p>It highlights the efforts of large corporations to navigate colonial independence and reveals the underestimated and continuous influence of Africa on thinking about race and racism in Britain.</p>
<p>Matera&#8217;s previous books include <em>The Global 1930s:</em> <em>The International Decade</em>; <em>Black London: The Imperial Metropolis and Decolonization in the 20th Century</em>; and <em>The Women&#8217;s War of 1929: Gender and Violence in Colonial Nigeria</em>.</p>
<p>Matera joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2012. He received his B.A. from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, his M.A from the University of Colorado, Boulder, and his Ph.D., from Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.</p>
<p>The ACLS Fellowship program is the longest-running of the organization&#8217;s current fellowship and grant programs. Institutions and individuals contributing to the program include The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Council's college and university Associates, and former Fellows and individual friends of ACLS.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="10979d808072701734bebd3c7e7a0185"><name>library-digitizes-tapes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Library awarded grant to digitize 670 tapes from Cabrillo Music Festival </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has received a grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources to digitize 670 audio recordings featuring a wide variety of works performed at the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music from 1964 to 1990.</summary><keywords>cabrillo music festival, other minds, ucsc special collections &amp; archives, ucsc news, uc santa cruz news, ucsc library, recordings at risk grants, uc santa cruz archives, ucsc archvies</keywords><start-date>1559352300000</start-date><display-name>recordings at risk grant</display-name><path>/2019/05/library-digitizes-tapes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/05/library-digitizes-tapes</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1559351499336</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1559687805504</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Academics</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Library</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/recordings-at-risk-tapes-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/recordings-at-risk-tapes-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>recordings-at-risk-tapes-500.jpg</name><display-name>recordings-at-risk-tapes-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>215057</file-size><width>500</width><height>375</height></image><image-alt>Cabrillo Music Festival tape boxes at UCSC Library</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/recordings-at-risk-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/recordings-at-risk-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>recordings-at-risk-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>recordings-at-risk-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23226</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Cabrillo Music Festival tape boxes at UCSC Library</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has received a grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) to digitize 670 audio recordings featuring a wide variety of works performed at the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music from 1964 to 1990.</p>
<p>This project is supported by the&#160;Recordings at Risk program, a national re-granting program administered by CLIR and funded by&#160;The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support the preservation of rare and unique audio and audiovisual content of high scholarly value.</p>
<p>The recordings will be drawn from both the Festival archives, which were donated to Special Collections in 1997, as well as the Bay Area music non-profit organization, Other Minds, which donated additional tapes to Special Collections in 2016. The reel-to-reel tape format is particularly susceptible to degradation, and this grant ensures that the recordings will be preserved for future use. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to be awarded this grant to digitize previously inaccessible reel-to-reel audio recordings of Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music performances,&#8221; said Teresa Mora, head of Special Collections &amp; Archives. &#8220;A local treasure, the Festival is a world-renowned institution, and we can't wait to be able to share these recordings with the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>The project is scheduled to be completed in April 2020. The recordings will be described in a finding aid on the Online Archive of California and made available to patrons on-site and remotely via the Library&#8217;s Digital Asset Management System. It is anticipated that they will be an essential resource for musicologists, historians, composers, and students.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;These recordings document</strong> the critical role the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music played in shaping local culture and national practices surrounding classical and contemporary music,&#8221; noted Madison Heying, who recently earned her Ph.D. in Cultural Musicology at UC Santa Cruz and co-wrote the grant application with Special Collections &amp; Archives.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of of the first music festivals to program contemporary, experimental, and world music alongside standard classical repertoire, the Festival became an important nexus for conductors, composers, performers, and the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heying added that the recordings are an important resource for interdisciplinary study of orchestral traditions in the U.S., and will benefit scholars of ethnomusicology, music theory, experimental and avant-garde music, conducting, composition, sound studies, and music technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once digitized, they will also be a pedagogical resource at UCSC and beyond for graduate and undergraduate courses in American music history, 20th century music, world music, history of electronic music, and classical music survey courses.&#8221;</p>
<p>This marks the second grant that UC Santa Cruz has received from the CLIR to preserve the Cabrillo Festival tapes. The latest award is an extension of a pilot grant the campus received in 2017 to digitize 69 open-reel audiotapes.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url/><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="402cf69b8072701734bebd3ce49022e8"><name>larive-reaction</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus prepares to welcome incoming chancellor Cynthia Larive</title><summary>“I have the sense that she’s really a person who can bring groups together,” said Carl Walsh, distinguished professor of economics at UC Santa Cruz and chair of the faculty subcommittee that reviewed hundreds of potential candidates for the top job.</summary><keywords>chancellor, larive, cynthia larive, cindy, reaction, ucsc, uc santa cruz, chemistry</keywords><start-date>1557903600000</start-date><display-name>Campus reaction</display-name><path>/2019/05/larive-reaction</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/05/larive-reaction</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1564444784232</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1564524347938</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/05/images/larive-web-418.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/05/images/larive-web-418.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>larive-web-418.jpg</name><display-name>larive-web-418.jpg</display-name><file-size>8749</file-size><width>418</width><height>279</height></image><image-alt>Cynthia Larive</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><div>

<p>These are a few of the ways members of the chancellor&#8217;s search committee described <a href="https://leadership.ucsc.edu/announcements/ucop/">incoming chancellor Cynthia K. Larive</a>, who will take office July 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the sense that she&#8217;s really a person who can bring groups together,&#8221; said Carl Walsh, distinguished professor of economics at UC Santa Cruz and chair of the faculty subcommittee that reviewed hundreds of potential candidates for the top job.</p>
<p>Larive, a professor of chemistry and the executive vice chancellor at UC Riverside, came to her interview with the search committee prepared to talk about issues&#8212;and solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;She emphasized the importance of all parts of the UC mission&#8212;research, teaching, and service&#8212;but what was unique about her interview was that she had looked in detail at the campus, identified an issue she wanted to talk about, and brought concrete suggestions of what she&#8217;d like to do about it,&#8221; said Walsh.</p>
<p>That particular issue&#8212;student retention and graduation rates&#8212;was one of the priorities Larive mentioned in <a href="https://leadership.ucsc.edu/announcements/remarks/">public remarks</a> made following the UC Regents&#8217; approval today (May 16, 2019) of her selection as the 11th chancellor of UC Santa Cruz. She also emphasized her commitment to diversity&#8212;and her intention to implement the Strategic Academic Plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;What impressed me about Cindy was that she thinks about the mismatches between what we say we want to do, what we&#8217;re currently doing, and the concrete things we can do to achieve our goals,&#8221; said Walsh, speculating that Larive&#8217;s experience as executive vice chancellor&#8212;as well as department chair and dean before that&#8212;honed that &#8220;problem solver&#8221; approach. &#8220;As a candidate, she displayed a more granular understanding of Santa Cruz and the campus&#8217;s issues.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="the-perfect-person-for-this-job">&#8220;The perfect person for this job&#8221;</h2>
<p>Search committee member Kamil Hasan, incoming chair of the UCSC Foundation, said he considers Larive &#8220;the perfect person for this job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;UCSC is a very diverse community, and to have a woman and first-generation college student is really amazing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She will be good at bringing people together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hasan was also enthusiastic about Larive&#8217;s ability to represent the campus in neighboring Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>&#8220;UCSC has not been as successful as it should be in developing relationships with Silicon Valley&#8212;building strategic partnerships and joint collaborative projects,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am sure she will be good at that. She is a well-known scientist, but UCSC&#8217;s interdisciplinary approach is very important&#8212;she said that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hasan emphasized that Silicon Valley needs more than scientists and engineers, and that Larive will be a great ambassador, promoting entrepreneurship and looking for &#8220;matches&#8221; between the campus&#8217;s &#8220;amazing research&#8221; and what Silicon Valley companies need.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at their problems with inequality, minority representation, and communications, you see they need much more than science, engineering, and technology,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Cindy sees that. She is a very good leader, a tough leader. And at the same time she has a very, very nice personality. We need a strong leader at UCSC at this critical juncture in its history. She is the perfect person to take the university to the next level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Katie Hellier (BS, physics 2014), a doctoral candidate in physics at UCSC and the graduate student representative on the search committee, echoed Hasan&#8217;s impression that Larive appreciates the uniqueness of UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s really excited about Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Hellier. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t take this job just because she wants to be a chancellor. She wants to be chancellor of UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a first-generation student is going to help her connect to our own first-gen students,&#8221; added Hellier. &#8220;I got the impression that the reason she&#8217;s in this to begin with is students. She wants students to feel supported, that they&#8217;re in a safe space and are getting what they expect from UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hellier described the experience of serving on the committee as &#8220;very positive&#8221; and said she and undergraduate representative Ayo Banjo felt their concerns were &#8220;taken to heart&#8221; by the committee.</p>
<p>Larive is deeply familiar with &#8220;issues&#8221; the campus is facing, including student housing, the budget, relationships with the Santa Cruz community, and the Silicon Valley campus, according to committee members.</p>
<p>It all sounds good to Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell, who expressed enthusiasm about Larive&#8217;s selection. &#8220;This is a good fit, a great addition to our campus,&#8221; said Mitchell. &#8220;Her emphasis on diversity at UC Riverside comes through, as does her commitment to first-gen students and to growing a campus that cares about social justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mitchell added that she sent Larive a quick note of congratulations after hearing the news of her selection. &#8220;She wrote back right away, which I took as a really good sign,&#8221; she said.</p>
<h2 id="i-felt-ready-to-jump-up-and-get-all-excited-again">&#8220;I felt ready to jump up and get all excited again&#8221;</h2>
<p>Fiona Weigant, department manager for education and the staff representative on the search committee, was thrilled by the news of Larive&#8217;s selection. &#8220;She embraces who we are and will help us capitalize on our strengths,&#8221; said Weigant. &#8220;For me, what stood out when she came into the room for her interview was how energetic and prepared she was. She knew us. She got Santa Cruz. I felt ready to jump up and get all excited again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every UC campus considers itself unique, but we&#8217;re special at Santa Cruz,&#8221; Weigant said with a knowing laugh. &#8220;The fear is always with a new person coming in that they will make us different. We&#8217;ll lose what makes us special. I think she&#8217;ll help us grow on the national and world stage while keeping the unique specialness that is UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>That initial conversation encompassed many topics, including student&#8212;and staff&#8212;activism. &#8220;She seemed to get that this is part of our campus culture,&#8221; said Weigant.</p>
<p>As a member of the Staff Advisory Board, Weigant acknowledged the depth of support Chancellor George Blumenthal has provided to staff for years. &#8220;He was instrumental in getting the staff advisor to the Regents position approved, and he has been a great advocate for staff at the systemwide level,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Whenever we&#8217;ve needed to talk to him, his door has always been open.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her advice for Larive? &#8220;Just remember to include staff,&#8221; said Weigant. &#8220;We keep the whole place going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carrie Partch, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry, welcomed news of a female chief executive. Although she doesn&#8217;t know Larive personally, she described Larive as an analytical chemist who has made pioneering contributions to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#8212;a technique Partch likened to &#8220;an MRI for molecules.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In my lab, we use it to study proteins, but she works on small molecules, including those in blood and urine,&#8221; said Partch. &#8220;It gives us a snapshot of what comes out of the body.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larive&#8217;s work is a perfect example of basic university research that has tremendous applied value, said Partch, adding, &#8220;She pushed forward the technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larive&#8217;s long tenure with UC, as a professor and administrator, has given her a great understanding of how UC campuses work, noted Walsh.</p>
<p>&#8220;My sense is that her natural instinct is to be very collaborative,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She came across as a very open, honest person. I think she&#8217;ll want to touch base with all the various constituencies on and off campus and build relations toward collaborative solutions that will help move the university forward.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="bd9cbf51807270172739340f7efe3f97"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2019/05/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/05/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1545074425667</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1545074425667</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
