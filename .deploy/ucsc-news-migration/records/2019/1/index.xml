<p>The $805,000 project for the new instrument was primarily supported by a $564,184 NSF grant, one of three awards the campus received this year from NSF&#8217;s highly competitive Major Research Instrumentation program. In addition, the Office of Research, the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, the Division of Social Sciences, three departments and a research institute all contributed a total of $241,000 to fully fund the instrument expansion.</p>
<p>Principal investigator Matthew McCarthy, a professor of ocean sciences, said the new equipment will support research across a wide range of disciplines, ranging from oceanography and earth science, paleontology, anthropology, ecology and fundamental biochemical cycle research.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want our facility to be a place that diverse scientists from UC Santa Cruz and across our region can use,&#8221; McCarthy said. &#8220;My vision for this is to be a national and international center for novel and leading-edge stable isotope approaches.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Powerful tool</strong></p>
<p>Stable isotope analysis is a powerful tool for tracing carbon and nutrients as they cycle through food webs and the environment. UCSC&#8217;s Stable Isotope Laboratory, established in 1994, has been one of the world&#8217;s top facilities for research on climatic and oceanographic conditions in Earth&#8217;s past (paleoclimatology and paleoceanography). Scientists using the lab are at the forefront of research on, for example, ancient greenhouse climates, El Ni&#241;o Southern Oscillation events, controls on rainfall in California, the vulnerability of species to global change, and other topics. According to McCarthy, research associated with the laboratory has generated over 165 scientific papers since 2004.</p>
<p>Isotopes are different forms of the same element. The most common naturally occurring isotope of carbon, for example, is carbon&#8211;12 (the 12 refers to the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the atom). Other carbon isotopes include carbon&#8211;14, which is unstable and emits radiation as it decays over time, and carbon&#8211;13, which is a stable isotope. While carbon&#8211;14 is useful for carbon dating, stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and other elements are useful in a wide range of scientific analyses.</p>
<p>Stable isotopes have proven especially valuable in the analysis of diet, where they can be used to distinguish between different sources of food. Isotopes in the food animals or humans eat are stored in their bones, teeth, and other tissues. By measuring the ratios of certain isotopes in tissue samples, researchers can determine, for example, where an animal fed and whether it ate primarily a marine, terrestrial, or freshwater diet. This ability has made stable isotopes an increasingly invaluable tool for not only ecology, but also paleontology, anthropology, and even forensics.</p>
<p>With the new grant, the Stable Isotope Lab will acquire a cutting-edge instrument called an isotope-ratio-monitoring mass spectrometer (IRMS). McCarthy explained that the IRMS is a powerful tool for performing compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA).</p>
<p>CSIA is a way of measuring isotopes in individual molecules rather than bulk samples, which is the traditional method of stable isotope analysis. This application has proven especially useful for measuring isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in amino acids. This type of analysis is a relatively new but very promising field of study that &#8220;has exploded in the last 15 years,&#8221; McCarthy said.</p>
<p><strong>Innovative research</strong></p>
<p>The new spectrometer will also substantially modernize the existing isotope lab, which was last updated in 2004 and contains still usable but rapidly aging instruments that are now limited in their capabilities. With this new equipment, UC Santa Cruz will continue to be in the forefront of innovative research in the years to come, McCarthy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My vision for this project was really to not just expand things, but to make us a premier, cutting-edge place in the world to do compound-specific isotope analysis across different disciplines,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>CSIA can be used in a broad range of scientific disciplines, including oceanography, biology, ecology, astrobiology, paleontology, Earth science, and environmental studies. One expanding area at UCSC in which CSIA has proven of particular value is in anthropology and archaeology. Traditionally, bulk sample measurement of ratios between carbon&#8211;13 and nitrogen&#8211;15 in human bone collagen have helped to distinguish diets composed of, for example, animal protein versus plant protein or terrestrial versus marine diets.</p>
<p>Recently, however, it is becoming increasingly clear that this technique is failing to provide adequate data in regions with complex ecosystems where diverse dietary resources are available. Compound-specific isotope analysis of individual amino acids, by contrast, can distinguish these more complex dietary regimes.</p>
<p>Vicky Oelze, assistant professor in biological anthropology, sees great potential for CSIA in her research on the diets and ecology of apes and prehistoric humans. &#8220;I want to use the compound-specific approach to answer questions on meat consumption in wild chimpanzees, because the patterns we&#8217;re seeing with bulk isotopes are often super confusing,&#8221; Oelze said. &#8220;If this method works out, we have a much more precise tool we can use for future work on meat consumption frequencies in wild fauna.&#8221;</p>
<p>CSIA will also be useful in a number of other areas, such as McCarthy&#8217;s research using deep-sea corals to look at millennial-scale oceanographic change. It can be used to investigate biogeochemical cycles, such as how land use changes have impacted nutrient dynamics in coastal and marine habitats, and for other applications such as studying the changes in food web dynamics in modern populations of marine mammals.</p>
<p>If all goes well, the new isotope equipment will be installed and ready for use in standard applications in spring 2019, McCarthy said.</p>
<p>The Stable Isotope Lab in the Earth and Marine Sciences building will be expanded to accommodate the new isotope-ratio-monitoring mass spectrometer. The lab will bring together scientists from different departments, divisions, and regional institutions, and will serve as a training ground for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as visiting researchers.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="108bb947807270172739340f579e0b0b"><name>athletics-opers-launches</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The Department of Athletics &amp; OPERS launches a new facility access and registration software</title><summary>In order to provide the best possible experience for UC Santa Cruz students, faculty, staff, and the local community, the Department of Athletics &amp; OPERS is launching new software.

<p>John Dizikes, a professor emeritus of American Studies and a founding member of the faculty of the University of California, Santa Cruz, died at his home in Santa Cruz on December 26, 2018. He was 86.</p>
<p>Dizikes was a Harvard-trained historian who joined UC Santa Cruz the summer before the campus first opened its doors to students in 1965. He was drawn to the school's commitment to undergraduates and its determination to be a different kind of modern research university&#8212;one organized around a system of smaller residential colleges that nurtured the student experience.</p>
<p>Over the course of 35 years, Dizikes was a professor of history, a professor and co-founder of the American Studies Department, provost of Cowell College from 1979-1983, and chair of the Council of Provosts.</p>
<p>"He was someone you noticed right away in a crowd&#8212;he was tall, with a deep voice. He literally stood out," recalled his friend and colleague of 50 years Todd Newberry, professor emeritus of biology and a fellow founding member of the UC Santa Cruz faculty. "I knew him from the start. Everyone thinks of John as one of the founding fathers of the campus."</p>
<p>A lifelong scholar propelled by an insatiable curiosity, Dizikes authored five books, including <em>Opera in America: A Cultural History</em>, which won the 1993 National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism. His other books include <em>Yankee Doodle Dandy: The Life and Times of Tod Sloan</em>, a biography of the Hall of Fame jockey; <em>Sportsmen and Gamesmen: From the Years that Shaped American Ideas about Winning and Losing and How to Play the Game</em>; and <em>Britain, Roosevelt, and the New Deal: British Opinion, 1932-1938</em>. Dizikes published his most recent book, <em>Love Songs: The Lives, Loves, and Poetry of Nine American Women</em>, less than a year ago, in March 2018.</p>
<p>Of <em>Opera in America</em>, Dizikes said, "I tried to write a story&#8212;not an encyclopedia or an analysis&#173;&#8212;and I tried to tell it in a way that would keep people reading. I tried to create suspense." And he credited his years of teaching with developing his skills as a storyteller: "Writing for a general audience is like lecturing to undergraduates. You have to show them why a subject is worth pursuing."</p>
<h3>Making the leap to UC Santa Cruz</h3>

<p>Dizikes was a young assistant professor of history at the University of Connecticut when he decided to make the leap and join the Santa Cruz campus. "Several friends said, 'For God's sake, don't go there, you'll end up doing the plumbing,'" he recalled during the campus's 50th anniversary celebration. "Of course they were right, but what they didn't realize was that it was incredibly exciting to start a place where we were relatively free to do new things."</p>
<p>The mythology surrounding the campus's earliest days hasn't been overblown, to hear Dizikes describe it in an account he gave for a UCSC oral history project: "Well, of course it was exceptional and we knew it and a lot of people felt it. And (Cowell College founding provost) Page Smith propagated overwhelmingly the idea shared by most of us, to a great degree, that we were now going to help with the reform of American higher education."</p>
<p>Newberry remembers those heady days, and the long hours involved. "It all made sense at the time," he recalled, describing Dizikes as the spiritual heart of Cowell College.</p>
<p>"If the first four colleges were a string quartet, John was the first violin: He set the pace, he set the tone, and he set the interpretation of what we were trying to do," said Newberry. "His office at Cowell was upstairs, off the breezeway, and you just felt like it was the condensation of the whole college right there."</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, Dizikes balanced teaching, writing, and administrative responsibilities, and he took pleasure in writing about topics that were overlooked by other scholars.</p>
<p>"Before he died, he was happiest to have his kids gather, and to have <em>Love Songs </em>out. It pleased him enormously," said Newberry. Dizikes described that book as a "group biography" of nine women writers.</p>
<h3>"The most beloved professor"</h3>

<figcaption>"John just had a way of being completely personal instantly with you," recalled Angie Christmann, the former coordinator of student programs at Cowell College. "You knew he was focused on this moment of encounter. It was delightful." (Photo by David Harsany)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Dizikes was a legendary teacher who mentored thousands of students throughout his career. He received the UCSC Alumni Association's Distinguished Teaching Award in 1985, and in 2002, the Humanities Division honored Dizikes' legacy by establishing the John Dizikes Teaching Award in Humanities. Presented annually to a faculty member of the division in recognition of their outstanding teaching, the award includes a $3,000 prize, as well as a student component: each faculty recipient selects an undergraduate to receive a $3,000 scholarship.</p>
<p>The first recipient, Bruce Thompson, called Dizikes "one of the most extraordinary teachers I've ever met." Upon hearing of Dizikes's death, Thompson expressed the sentiments of many when he said, "I don't think I'm going out on a limb in saying that he must have been the most beloved professor in the history of our university."</p>
<p>Dizikes had a monumental impact on many staff, as well as faculty and students, particularly at Cowell College. Adrianne Waite (Cowell College, B.A. American Studies, '81) met Dizikes as an undergraduate. Later, when working in student affairs at Cowell in the 1990s, she invoked his name when faced with a particularly challenging student discipline matter.</p>
<p>"I was struggling to find any way to reach this young man about making different choices," she said.&#160;"He was feuding with a neighbor and doing socially inappropriate things.&#160;It turned out he was in a class with John and really admired him.&#160;I found myself saying, 'Maybe next time you are in conflict with this person you could ask yourself, What Would John Dizikes do?'"</p>
<p>The student, who had been so oppositional, paused to take in Waite's words. "And his attitude and behavior did change," she said. "John was always so kind and gracious. I hoped it would prompt the student to examine his behavior, and it did."</p>
<p>Angie Christmann and Ziggy Rendler-Bregman co-led Cowell's student programs for many years and remained friends with Dizikes until the end. Christmann said Dizikes was like a "ray of sunshine."</p>
<p>"John just had a way of being completely personal instantly with you," she said. "You knew he was focused on this moment of encounter. It was delightful."</p>
<p>Dizikes valued their work in student affairs, and he and his wife Ann were a team. "They had the same intention," said Christmann.</p>
<p>"We said, 'This is the Golden Era,'" recalled Rendler-Bregman. "We knew we were in a very special time that was touched by his leadership." To this day, she cherishes a hand-written note she received from Dizikes after the birth of her first son, who arrived healthy but six weeks early. His message: "It is never too early for parents to realize their child will do unexpected things."</p>
<p>Contemplating how Dizikes would react to hearing the accolades being shared since his death, Rendler-Bregman painted a virtual picture: "He'd turn his head, close his eyes, smile that sweet smile, and say 'Okay, that's enough. That's enough now.'" she said. "He would receive it, but he wouldn't let it go on and on."</p>
<h3>Lifelong friendships with students</h3>
<p>For years after his official retirement in 2000, Dizikes would go to campus almost daily to check his mail, then walk back down to his home on the Westside. He remained an active member of the campus community, attending many Cowell College events, as well as Alumni Weekend festivities, including the Annual Dizikes Concert. The concert, established by alum David Kadish (Cowell College, B.A. history; 1973), was always a highlight of the weekend.</p>
<p>"He loved music, he absolutely loved music," Kadish said of his mentor professor and friend of 45 years. "Musical performance was a part of the culture of the early days of Cowell College, and I was crazy about music, so it felt like the right way to honor him."</p>
<p>Kadish met Dizikes early in his first quarter on campus, when Dizikes and his wife opened their home on King Street to any students who wanted to watch a new PBS television series, "Civilization." That ignited a connection that would endure for decades.</p>
<p>"He had a unique ability to bring students into the fold, and once you were there, you never wanted to leave," said Kadish. "He was comfortable in his own skin and did things in a way that made everyone around him feel equally comfortable. He made himself open and available to undergraduates. That was his love: undergraduates."</p>
<p>Dizikes was a former student of Cowell College&#8217;s first provost, Page Smith, whom he met at UCLA, and remained close to Smith during his career. At UCSC, Dizikes "threw himself into the undergraduate teaching commitment," said Kadish. "It wasn't easy for him, and he almost didn't get tenure because he spent too much time teaching and not enough time publishing. If he'd been turned down for tenure, there would've been a revolution in the streets of Santa Cruz. He was committed to the ideals of the campus and never lost those."</p>
<p>He was also demanding&#8212;of students, and himself. He labored over what others might consider insignificant details, such as whether to use the contractions "can't" and "isn't" in <em>Opera in America</em>. And he was delighted to receive a letter from a reader who appreciated his choice. "She said she knew as soon as she saw the book that she would enjoy it because I had used contractions," he said. "I had thought a lot about that."</p>
<p>Dizikes's scholarship, like his teaching, was marked by thoughtful deliberation, and he chose his subjects with care. "For a long time I was known, almost notoriously, as a non-writer," Dizikes said in 1994. "I just write about what I love."</p>
<p>Kadish recalled Dizikes's slight formality&#8212;he always wore a tie when on campus, for example. "Times have changed, but I would never have thought of calling him anything but Mr. Dizikes or Professor Dizikes until about 20 years ago," he added.</p>
<h3>A provost for the ages</h3>

<p>When Dizikes was named provost of Cowell College, he and Ann opened the provost's on-campus home to students in a new way, hosting many events, including small receptions with just a few students each week before College Night. By the end of the year, every Cowell student living on campus had received an invitation.</p>
<p>"They wanted real conversation, they didn't want chit chat," said Rendler-Bregman. "For some students, it blew them away and was the beginning of lifelong friendships."</p>
<p>Each week's invitees would join Dizikes and his wife at the head table. "John would step onto the stage to welcome everyone, and then, acknowledging that he didn't know everyone's traditions, he would call for a minute of silence together to appreciate where we were in that moment, gathered together for this meal," said Rendler-Bregman. "Think about that: Who else could hold 500 18- and 19-year-olds in silence for a minute?"</p>
<p>Dizikes, the son of Greek immigrants, grew up on a farm in Utah. His father, Peter, who was caring but strict, worked as a custodian and night watchman after they moved to Southern California. His mother, Virginia, was open, generous, and loving. From these humble roots, Dizikes grew up to be one of the campus's strongest champions of undergraduates, with an unwavering commitment to their education, growth, and empowerment. He literally changed lives.</p>
<p>"One of my only personal regrets is that for years, I invited them to visit our house in France," recalled Kadish. "Last year, I invited him again, and I remember he said, 'Well, maybe next year. I might have one more trip to Europe in me.' But he never made it."</p>
<p>Dizikes died of heart failure. He is survived by his wife Ann; their daughter Helen Sanders and her husband Rick Sanders; their son Peter and his wife Mary Lewis; four grandchildren; and his brother Dean and sister-in-law Marilyn. He is predeceased by a daughter Virginia, and his brother Leo and sister-in-law Kathy. A memorial gathering is being planned; details will be shared when they are available.</p>

The burns could start as early as this week, providing it is a permissive burn day. <br/><br/>The piles are between the Cave Gulch neighborhood and Twin Gates. All piles will be extinguished before Cal Fire leaves the area. <br/><br/>Pile burns are tightly controlled, and typically produce less smoke prescribed burns. However, persons susceptible to smoke are advised of possible air-quality concerns in the immediate area and in parts of campus when the burns occur. If you are affected by air-quality issues, avoid the area.<br/><br/>Santa Cruz County has been fortunate not to experience a major wildland fire in recent years, but fires throughout California this past fall remind us that we all must do our part to prevent them. That includes controlling vegetation on and around campus. The pile burns are part of that effort. <br/><br/>For more information, please visit our <a href="https://oes.ucsc.edu/emergency-management/preparedness/hazard-resources/wildland-fires.html">wildland fire resource page online</a>.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz campus community</audience><admin>Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2a1618a3807270172739340f2d073781"><name>dizikes-george-message</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>News about founding faculty member John Dizikes</title><summary>John Dizikes, a founding UC Santa Cruz faculty member who helped establish this campus as a student-focused institution, died Dec. 26 at his home in Santa Cruz.</summary><start-date>1546848000000</start-date><display-name>News about founding faculty member John Dizikes</display-name><path>/2019/01/dizikes-george-message</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/01/dizikes-george-message</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1546894316711</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1546894316711</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I'm writing today to pass along some sad news. John Dizikes, a founding UC Santa Cruz faculty member who helped establish this campus as a student-focused institution, died Dec. 26 at his home in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">During his more than 50-year association with UC Santa Cruz, John left an indelible mark. He was a professor of history, a co-founder of the American Studies Department, and a provost of Cowell College. First and foremost, though, he was a dedicated educator, committed to the ideals of UC Santa Cruz and absolutely devoted to our students.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">John first saw our campus when it was still unfolding in the minds of our founders. No buildings had even been constructed yet, but he was thrilled by the opportunity to help build an institution from the ground up, where new approaches to higher education could be implemented, with students the centerpiece. John was a central figure in those early efforts. He mentored thousands of students over the course of his career. An award bearing his name is presented each year to a Humanities Division faculty member who displays excellence in teaching, recognizing the transformative impact great teaching has on undergraduates.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">John saw himself as a student &#8212; always curious, always learning &#8212; and had wide-ranging interests. He loved music. He had a deep interest in thoroughbred horse racing. His book on opera in America won the 1993 National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism. He was a scholar on Roosevelt's New Deal. His most recent book, published less than a year ago, was a group biography of female writers. Our campus loses a Renaissance man with his passing.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">John was a wonderful colleague &#8212; personable, helpful, and undeniably enthusiastic about UC Santa Cruz. His passing will be felt deeply, but he leaves us with a rich legacy. John positively impacted the lives of thousands.

<p dir="ltr"><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span>As I&#8217;m sure you know, the federal government is undergoing a partial shutdown. While approximately three-quarters of the government remains funded, significant portions including many federal research agencies are impacted. The agencies affected include National Science Foundation (NSF), </span><span>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</span><span>, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), United States Geological Survey (USGS), and National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Department of Energy (DOE) are notable exceptions; the current funding for these two agencies extends to Sept. 30, 2019.&#160;&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">As in past shutdowns, it is likely that no funds&#8211;neither new awards nor annual increments of ongoing awards&#8211;will be forthcoming from affected agencies until the shutdown has ended.&#160; While there is no standard for how long a government shutdown will last, the longest previous shutdown of the US government was 21 days.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Per Peggy Arrivas, UC associate vice president and systemwide controller, UC will continue to pay its employees on time regardless of whether the federal government continues to pay for activities on contracts and grants, with reimbursement expected (where needed) after the shutdown. It is possible the costs may not be allowed during the shutdown; in that case we would need to find other funding sources for anyone who was being paid on a federal grant or contract. In a couple of cases systemwide, PIs have received stop work orders.&#160; In those cases we must still pay our employees in accordance with the applicable policy or union contract, which normally stipulates that we must provide 30 days advance notice to employees in case of termination.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span>Until the situation is resolved, researchers with existing and anticipated awards are encouraged to defer expenses as much as possible so that existing funds may be used</span><span>, </span><span>should it prove necessary,</span><span> </span><span>to support soft-funded staff, including grad students, postdocs, and other soft-funded researchers and support staff.&#160;&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Researchers with new awards should expect that the funds will be delayed until at least the end of the shutdown (and quite possibly longer).&#160;&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span>Review of any submitted proposals will also be delayed and it is possible, but not guaranteed, that those with submission deadlines during the shutdown may have those deadlines extended past the end of the shutdown (see: </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nsf.gov/shutdown/grantees.jsp&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1546987740001000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxt963kYUf541-mvzQjVuy4IBlKA" href="https://www.nsf.gov/shutdown/grantees.jsp" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>https://www.nsf.gov/shutdown/<wbr/>grantees.jsp</span></a><span> for information on current NSF policies during the shutdown, and </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nssc.nasa.gov/grants&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1546987740001000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIDTWmNMTrLgjPAn8c99Rc95pm8Q" href="https://www.nssc.nasa.gov/grants" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>https://www.nssc.nasa.gov/<wbr/>grants</span></a><span> for information on NASA grants).</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span>Any faculty experiencing a shutdown-related funding crisis should consult with their dean on ways to bridge the funding gap until the situation is resolved.

Her official start date is today, January 4th.</p>
<p>Blia has provided remarkable leadership as the interim director since October of 2017. Her leadership was instrumental to our campus achieving the critical 2:1 agreement that we would have one California transfer student for every two California frosh. She and the undergraduate admissions team reached the non-resident enrollment goal. She also led efforts that resulted in the selection of a new customer relations management system that will allow for enhanced communications and event planning for future cohorts. Additional contributions include work with her team, Enrollment Management, and the Division of Undergraduate Education on a staffing plan that includes new positions and re-envisioned positions to put the campus in the best position to meet our many enrollment goals.</p>
<p>Blia assumes this new role with extensive experience dating back to 2000 when she started her career at UC Santa Barbara as an articulation specialist working with all California community colleges. Her role there grew to include outreach, recruitment, yield, and program development, coordination, and implementation. She has managed and facilitated strategic planning of programs and services, as well as developed annual review processes to interpret, analyze, and create data-driven plans to enhance programs and services. Her experience as a first generation Hmong refugee at UC Santa Barbara inspired her to seek funds from the student-initiated outreach program as a student to provide outreach experiences to her Hmong community. Her intersectional identities have fueled her passion for serving students who have not always had access to higher education. Helping students realize their full potential and creating an avenue for social mobility brings her great satisfaction and pride.</p>
<p>While at UC Santa Barbara, she worked very closely with departments and Deans in relation to both articulation and recruitment and yield events. Her supervisors and colleagues at Santa Barbara described her as always imagining a different way and well respected by staff, faculty, students, and families. They also indicated she has a vision and is very inclusive as she seeks to understand and talk through complex issues.</p>
<p>Staff and faculty throughout our campus recognize Blia&#8217;s invaluable depth of knowledge and her broad and deep perspectives regarding all aspects of admissions. She is described as passionate and sincere, with a clear understanding and respect for shared governance, role of faculty in setting admissions priorities and in seeking creative opportunities for enacting those priorities. Many across campus have appreciated her professionalism, personable approach, motivation, clear vision, and strong leadership during her recent role as the interim director. Blia looks forward to creating stronger partnerships with departments and communities.</p>
<p>Blia is located in the newly renovated Undergraduate Admissions Office in Hahn Student Services.</p>
<p>Please join me in congratulating and welcoming Blia into this new role! I truly look forward to working with Blia as we continue to identify, recruit, select, yield, and process academic credit for the future Banana Slug Alumni the campus most desires!</p>
<p>I would also like the recognize the search committee, listed below, who worked quickly, effectively, and successfully!</p>

<p>Shane has been a member of the CHES family since 2005, working with graduate student housing, the University Town Center, and joining the Crown/Merrill family in 2011 as the CRE for the Crown apartments. Shane&#8217;s exuberance for students and his job could be seen in his colorful restoration of the Crown/Merrill Community Room and recurring events including the C/M welcome bbq, and Diagon Alley. Shane was also the advisor of the Tabletop Gaming Association, who make the Crown/Merrill dining hall their home every weekend.</p>
<p>But Shane was a recognized personality around campus, having both taught and frequented OPERS rec classes and participating in a variety of campus events. Some of my first memories of Shane were student accounts of wickedly tough classes they&#8217;d attended. Shane also gave his time to assist the University Interfaith Council.</p>
<p>With his generous spirit, Shane had a way of showing up for others in times of need or taking on a menial task no one else wanted to do. Shane believed in his Resident Assistants as empowered leaders and strongly advocated for students every opportunity he had. Shane was one of a kind, and his brightly colored presence will surely be missed up here on the hill.</p>
<p>Please join me in sending good thoughts to Shane&#8217;s partner, Gina, and his family, including his sweet dog Galaxy.</p>
<p>As we enter the new quarter, thank you for continuing to be present and supportive for our students and each other as we move through this difficult time. If you need additional support, you may also want to access the Employee Assistance Program at 1&#8211;866&#8211;808&#8211;6205 (https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/).</p>
<p>A celebration of life is being planned for early February and more information will be available on the <a href="https://crown.ucsc.edu">Crown College website</a></p>

<p>One of the essential and defining artists of his generation, Ligon has also created work in video, neon sculpture, photography, and printmaking that has been shown internationally for over two decades and resides in the collections of major museums around the world.</p>
<p>Politically provocative, yet formally rigorous, his artwork explores issues of race, history, language, and identity.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, January 15, UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Arts and Sciences will present a lecture by Ligon on campus at the Digital Arts Research Center as part of its ongoing <em>TRACTION: Art Talks </em>series<strong>. </strong></p>
<p>The event begins at 7 p.m. and is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are honored to bring Glenn Ligon to UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Institute of the Arts and Sciences director John Weber. &#8220;What I appreciate most about Ligon&#8217;s work is his combination of conceptual subtlety and visual power, and the quiet fearlessness Glenn brings to any subject he decides to take on. He&#8217;s an artist I deeply respect and have worked with twice in the past, so it is a thrill that he&#8217;s coming to Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ligon came of age as an artist in the late 1980s and early 1990s,&#8221; Weber added. &#8220;It was a time when a diverse, dynamic cohort of American artists emerged and transformed American art. They rejected the racial, economic, and gender politics of the Reagan administration and were outraged by its non-response to the AIDS crisis, yet also energized by the realization that art offered a means to talk back publicly and make their voices heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ligon has been the subject of solo museum exhibitions at the Camden Arts Centre in London, the Power Plant in Toronto, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and the Studio Museum in Harlem. His work has been included in such major international exhibitions as the Venice Biennale (2015 and 1997), Berlin Biennal (2014), Istanbul Biennal (2011), Documenta XI (2002), and Gwangju Biennale (2000).&#160;</p>
<p>The Whitney Museum of American Art also held a mid-career retrospective of Ligon&#8217;s work, <em>Glenn Ligon: America</em>, in 2011 that traveled the country. In his introduction to the exhibition, Whitney Museum director Adam Weinberg noted, &#8220;Ligon has been able to successfully produce works that are disturbing, disruptive, and transgressive while simultaneously seductive, sensual, and stunningly gorgeous&#8230;His subject matter ranges widely from the Million Man March and the aftermath of slavery to 1970s coloring books and the photography of Robert Mapplethorpe."</p>
<p>Ligon&#8217;s recent shows include <em>Glenn Ligon: Encounters and Collisions</em>, a curatorial project organized with Nottingham Contemporary and Tate Liverpool, and <em>Blue Black</em>, an exhibition he curated at the Pulitzer Arts Foundation in St. Louis, inspired by the site-specific Ellsworth Kelly wall sculpture of the same name.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3398fb84807270172739340fc8ede737"><name>sanford-mira</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biologist Jeremy Sanford awarded prestigious $1.85 million grant from NIH</title><summary>MIRA grant funds Sanford to extend his studies of the mechanisms of RNA processing and RNA-binding proteins, which are involved in inherited diseases and cancer.</summary><keywords>MIRA, NIGMS, Jeremy Sanford</keywords><start-date>1547020800000</start-date><display-name>Biologist Jeremy Sanford awarded prestigious $1.85 million grant from NIH</display-name><path>/2019/01/sanford-mira</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/01/sanford-mira</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1547053889511</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1547054503980</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/jeremy-sanford-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/jeremy-sanford-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jeremy-sanford-250.jpg</name><display-name>jeremy-sanford-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>59804</file-size><width>250</width><height>357</height></image><image-alt>Jeremy Sanford</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/jeremy-sanford-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/jeremy-sanford-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jeremy-sanford-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jeremy-sanford-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15873</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jeremy Sanford</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jeremy Sanford</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>MIRA grant funds Sanford to extend his studies of the mechanisms of RNA processing and RNA-binding proteins, which are involved in inherited diseases and cancer</article-subhead><article-text><p>Jeremy Sanford, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz, has received a $1.85 million grant from the Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) program of the National Institute for General Medical Science (NIGMS). The five-year grant provides flexible, long-term funding for Sanford's research program, which focuses on understanding the role of RNA-binding proteins in regulating gene expression.</p>
<p>The human genome contains tens of thousands of protein-coding genes. When a gene is turned on, many RNA copies are made of the gene's DNA sequence. The genetic code carried by these "messenger RNAs" is then translated into a protein that will perform some cellular function. Before that happens, however, the RNA copies are subject to an elaborate regulatory system in which the messages may be processed in different ways, leading to dramatic changes in gene expression. RNA-binding proteins orchestrate virtually all of these regulatory decisions.</p>
<p>"In my lab, we want to understand how RNA-binding proteins control the cellular fate of messenger RNAs," Sanford said. "We are interested in how messages are assembled and how this information is used by the cell. I find it fascinating that alternatively processed messages from the same gene can have radically different functions in the cell."</p>
<p>According to Sanford, this field is especially important because aberrant RNA processing is the root cause of some inherited human diseases, such as spinal muscular atrophy and myotonic dystrophy, and some cancers. "The advent of drugs targeting RNA makes this a truly exciting time to be studying the actions of RNA-binding proteins," he said.</p>
<p>The MIRA grant provides an additional year of funding compared to regular NIH grants, and it supports the investigator's overall research program rather than one specific project. The goal of MIRA is to increase the efficiency of NIGMS funding by providing investigators with greater stability and flexibility, thereby enhancing scientific productivity and the chances for important breakthroughs.</p>
<p>"It gives investigators the freedom to follow the best scientific path forward," Sanford said. "There is no better place to be doing this kind of work than at UC Santa Cruz, which has been the epicenter of the RNA world for decades."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="38f081db807270172739340f1466838f"><name>shw-regents</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Regents to discuss Student Housing West next week</title><start-date>1547107200000</start-date><display-name>Student Housing West</display-name><path>/2019/01/shw-regents</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/01/shw-regents</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1547143511461</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1547143511461</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Board of Regents will learn more about <a href="https://ucsc.edu/shw">Student Housing West</a> during its meeting next week, when the project will be on the agenda as a discussion item.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>Though UC Santa Cruz provides housing for 9,300 students&#8212;roughly half of its student body&#8212;there remains an urgent need for affordable campus housing, especially for upper-division students who otherwise would be living in the surrounding community. Student Housing West is the single largest housing project underway in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>As proposed, Student Housing West will create 3,072 new beds at two sites on the UC Santa Cruz main campus, one along Heller Drive, the other along Hagar Drive.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="390c27c1807270172739340fd78ed07c"><name>cruz-hacks</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CruzHacks 2019 to be held at Stevenson Event Center January 18 to 20</title><summary>With CruzHacks 2019 shaping up to be the biggest and most diverse UCSC hackathon yet, openings are still available for judges and mentors.</summary><keywords>hackathon, CruzHacks</keywords><start-date>1547107200000</start-date><display-name>CruzHacks 2019 to be held at Stevenson Event Center January 18 to 20</display-name><path>/2019/01/cruz-hacks</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/01/cruz-hacks</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1547145323609</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1547145525520</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs Office</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioweb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/cruzhacks-logo-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/cruzhacks-logo-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cruzhacks-logo-350.jpg</name><display-name>cruzhacks-logo-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>27324</file-size><width>350</width><height>343</height></image><image-alt>CruzHacks logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/cruzhacks-logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/cruzhacks-logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cruzhacks-logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cruzhacks-logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14285</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>CruzHacks logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>With CruzHacks 2019 shaping up to be the biggest and most diverse UCSC hackathon yet, openings are still available for judges and mentors</article-subhead><article-text><p>With over 1,000 applications received for this year&#8217;s student-run hackathon at UC Santa Cruz, <a href="https://www.cruzhacks.com/">CruzHacks 2019</a> is shaping up to be the biggest and most diverse one yet. Opening ceremonies will start at 7 p.m. on Friday, January 18, at the Stevenson Event Center.</p>
<p>Roughly 40 percent of the participants will hail from outside of UC Santa Cruz, signifying the event&#8217;s widespread appeal to surrounding communities.

Hale Award last week in New York City at the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA).<br/><br/>The LSA is the major professional society in the United States that is dedicated to the scientific study of language.&#160;</p>
<p>It plays a critical role in supporting and disseminating linguistic scholarship, as well as facilitating the application of current research to scientific, educational, and social issues concerning language.</p>
<p>&#8220;In her work on Mayan languages, which spans more than forty years, Judith Aissen has made outstanding contributions in language documentation, linguistic theory, and the mentoring of indigenous linguists,&#8221; the LSA citation noted. &#8220;Aissen&#8217;s published works are models of theoretically informed linguistic description; viewed another way, they are models of empirically-based theoretical work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aissen has been a stalwart, dedicated mentor of indigenous linguists in Mexico and Guatemala, teaching seminars and workshops,&#8221; the citation added. &#8220;In short, Aissen has earned this award for her energetic documentation of Tzotzil and other Mayan languages, her success at bringing these languages to bear on linguistic theory, and her commitment to the nurturing of indigenous linguists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aissen began studying Mayan languages in 1972 as a linguistics graduate student at Harvard, where she participated in a long-term anthropology project sponsored by the National Science Foundation. She traveled to San Cristobal de las Casas, a colonial town in the highlands of Chiapas, where she conducted fieldwork with native speakers.</p>
<p>After joining the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1983, Aissen continued to return to San Cristobal in the summers to carry out her own research. She eventually began teaching workshops under the auspices of research organizations in Mexico and Guatemala with the goal of helping to preserve the threatened Mayan languages.<br/><br/>Aissen noted that her LSA award honors the linguist Ken Hale (1934-2001), whose work brought indigenous languages to bear on issues in theoretical syntax, thereby transforming a field which had previously been dominated by the world's major languages. Hale was also a forceful advocate for the need to train native speakers of indigenous languages as linguists so that they could participate fully in the documentation and analysis of their own languages.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2007/10/1626.html</url><title>Saving Endangered Languages</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3e80ccc5807270172739340f59d3a4a4"><name>wave-power</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Upper-ocean warming is changing the global wave climate, making waves stronger</title><summary>The energy in ocean waves has been increasing as a consequence of climate change, according to a new study.</summary><keywords>Borja Reguero</keywords><start-date>1547460000000</start-date><display-name>Upper-ocean warming is changing the global wave climate, making waves stronger</display-name><path>/2019/01/wave-power</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/01/wave-power</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1547236854066</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1547480661634</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Carlos Nieto, IH Cantabria</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/waves-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/waves-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>waves-450.jpg</name><display-name>waves-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>51574</file-size><width>450</width><height>253</height></image><image-alt>waves crashing in front of lighthouse</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/waves-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/waves-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>waves-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>waves-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16021</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>waves crashing</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Increasing wave energy with climate change means more challenges for coastal risk and adaptation.

In a study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08066-0">published January 14 in </a><em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08066-0">Nature Communications</a>,</em> researchers report that the energy of ocean waves has been growing globally, and they found a direct association between ocean warming and the increase in wave energy.</p>
<p>A wide range of long-term trends and projections carry the fingerprint of climate change, including rising sea levels, increasing global temperatures, and declining sea ice. Analyses of the global marine climate thus far have identified increases in wind speeds and wave heights in localized areas of the ocean in the high latitudes of both hemispheres. These increases have been larger for the most extreme values (e.g., winter waves) than for the mean conditions. However, a global signal of change and a correlation between the localized increases in wave heights and global warming had remained undetected.</p>
<p>The new study focused on the energy contained in ocean waves, which is transmitted from the wind and transformed into wave motion. This metric, called wave power, has been increasing in direct association with historical warming of the ocean surface. The upper ocean warming, measured as a rising trend in sea-surface temperatures, has influenced wind patterns globally, and this, in turn, is making ocean waves stronger.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first time, we have identified a global signal of the effect of global warming in wave climate. In fact, wave power has increased globally by 0.4 percent per year since 1948, and this increase is correlated with the increasing sea-surface temperatures, both globally and by ocean regions,&#8221; said lead author Borja G. Reguero, a researcher in the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Climate change is modifying the oceans in different ways, including changes in ocean-atmosphere circulation and water warming, according to coauthor Inigo J. Losada, director of research at the Environmental Hydraulics Institute at the University of Cantabria (IHCantabria), where the study was developed.</p>
<p>"This study shows that the global wave power can be a potentially valuable indicator of global warming, similarly to carbon dioxide concentration, the global sea level rise, or the global surface atmospheric temperature," Losada said.</p>
<p>Understanding how the energy of ocean waves responds to oceanic warming has important implications for coastal communities, including anticipating impacts on infrastructure, coastal cities, and small island states. Ocean waves determine where people build infrastructure, such as ports and harbors, or require protection through coastal defenses such as breakwaters and levees. Indeed, wave action is one of the main drivers of coastal change and flooding, and as wave energy increases, its effects can become more profound. Sea level rise will further aggravate these effects by allowing more wave energy to reach shoreward.</p>
<p>While the study reveals a long-term trend of increasing wave energy, the effects of this increase are particularly apparent during the most energetic storm seasons, as occurred during the winter of 2013-14 in the North Atlantic, which impacted the west coast of Europe, or the devastating 2017 hurricane season in the Caribbean, which offered a harsh reminder of the destructive power and economic impacts of coastal storms.</p>
<p>The effects of climate change will be particularly noticeable at the coast, where humans and oceans meet, according to coauthor Fernando J. M&#233;ndez, associate professor at Universidad de Cantabria. &#8220;Our results indicate that risk analysis neglecting the changes in wave power and having sea level rise as the only driver may underestimate the consequences of climate change and result in insufficient or maladaptation,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commencement weekend is an exciting celebration for our students and their friends and family. We must also ensure it is accessible and safe for all patrons. Fourteen separate events are hosted in two major campus venues over a three-day period. These 14 events include one graduate and ten undergraduate degree-conferring ceremonies, and three very large scale departmental celebrations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to maximum seating capacity at one of the commencement venues and overall limitations in parking availability, transit and time duration between each event, for the first time ever we are utilizing ticketing for each of the ceremonies. Doing so will assist participants in knowing they will have a seat from which to participate and will enable us to ensure guests for the subsequent ceremony will have a place to park and time to arrive for their graduate's ceremony. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each graduate will receive&#160;</span><strong>6 tickets</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;to distribute to their family&#160;and friends for attendance, as well as&#160;</span><strong>2 parking permits</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Guests who do not possess a ticket will not be permitted entrance into any ceremony. Drivers of vehicles that do not possess a parking pass will not be permitted to park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus will live-stream each of the 14 commencement&#160;ceremonies/celebrations so that individuals who are unable to travel or participate in person will have a front row seat from virtually anywhere in the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More information on ticketing and registration will be released in the coming weeks.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Questions about commencement can be directed to&#160;</span><a href="mailto:commencement@ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commencement@ucsc.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4d6d945b807270172739340f40e3530a"><name>in-memoriam-sree</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Sree Divya Alla</title><summary>Divya passed away on Saturday, January 5, 2019.

Conditions were too wet for burnling last week. However, the burns could start as early as this week, providing it is a permissive burn day.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The piles are between the Cave Gulch neighborhood and Twin Gates. All piles will be extinguished before Cal Fire leaves the area.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Pile burns are tightly controlled, and typically produce less smoke prescribed burns. However, persons susceptible to smoke are advised of possible air-quality concerns in the immediate area and in parts of campus when the burns occur. If you are affected by air-quality issues, avoid the area.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Santa Cruz County has been fortunate not to experience a major wildland fire in recent years, but fires throughout California this past fall remind us that we all must do our part to prevent them. That includes controlling vegetation on and around campus. The pile burns are part of that effort.&#160;</div>

The $12,500 he received is relatively small among science grants. Still the workshop it funded helped shape the ambitious effort to sequence genomes of 10,000 vertebrates. <a href="https://genome10k.soe.ucsc.edu/">Genome 10k&#8217;s</a> funders now include the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the National Institutes of Health.<br/><br/>Since then, the BOF has awarded 58 more grants&#8212;about five or six per year&#8212;averaging about $8,500 each. Funded and independently directed by the trustees, the BOF has supported projects from students, faculty, and all the divisions. <br/><br/>Now, spirited fundraising has increased capacity, and trustee Richard Moss, chair of the foundation&#8217;s BOF committee, says he hopes to give more and larger grants.<br/>
<h3>&#8220;Money waiting&#8230;&#8221;</h3>
&#8220;We&#8217;re looking for unusual or orphan projects that otherwise wouldn&#8217;t qualify for funding from other sources,&#8221; Moss (Stevenson &#8216;85, modern society and social thought) says. <br/><br/>While many BOF grants have gone to faculty, Moss hopes to invite a wider variety of applicants.<br/><br/>&#8220;I have always wanted to get the word out to students, the student government, and student groups: there&#8217;s money waiting for you.&#8221; <br/>
<h3>&#8220;Like yeast&#8221;</h3>
The <a href="http://zapotec.ucsc.edu/slz/">Santiago Laxopa Zapotec Language Project</a> also began with a small BOF grant. Linguistics faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students document and analyze the endangered languages of immigrants from the area of Oaxaca, Mexico.<br/><br/>&#8220;These languages are valuable and worthy of study,&#8221; says Ph.D. student Andrew Hedding, who helps run the project.<br/><br/>The project now includes <a href="http://wlma.ucsc.edu/nidodelenguas/clases.html">events aimed at destigmatizing Oaxacan languages</a>. Since the BOF&#8217;s initial $12,000, much larger grants have followed, and the effort has taken on a life of its own, says trustee SB Master (Cowell &#8216;75, economics/history). She applauded the project for engaging community, involving undergraduates in research, and opening a new direction for inquiry.<br/><br/>&#8220;This is like the trifecta of what we want these grants to do,&#8221; Master says. &#8220;I like to think of BOF grants as the yeast that get really exciting things going.&#8221;<br/>
<h3>Unique projects</h3>
<p>Early support from campus can persuade government, corporate, and foundation funders that a project holds promise, Moss says. And just the process of applying for a BOF grant can improve a proposal.<br/><br/>&#8220;It was a really good process,&#8221; says John Weber, director of the Institute of Arts and Sciences (IAS). &#8220;The committee is very supportive, and the dialogue has been useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2016, the <a href="http://ias.ucsc.edu/content/2015/artist-residence-russell-crotty">BOF contributed to artist Russell Crotty&#8217;s residency</a> with the IAS. Crotty&#8217;s work combined sculpture with images captured by the Lick Observatory&#8217;s 36-inch telescope. The BOF funded an accompanying exhibit about the observatory and a field trip bringing art and astronomy students together at Lick Observatory to discuss the concept of knowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was very much what we hoped would happen, to open up new ideas in students&#8217; minds about what is possible.&#8221; Weber says.<br/><br/>&#8220;My hope is we&#8217;ll continue to fund unique kinds of things and things nobody ever thought of,&#8220; says trustee Loren Steck, a member of the BOF committee.<br/><br/>For Steck (Porter &#8216;73, individual major), the 2012 grant to the Mock Trial team stands out. The $5,000 award made it possible for the team to participate in a statewide competition. The BOF has also granted challenge matches for fundraisers and startup funds for Hack UCSC and the Business Plan Competition. <br/><br/>&#8220;We&#8217;re committed to providing a source of resources that is quick, straightforward, and cuts through the bureaucracy,&#8221; Moss says. &#8220;We&#8217;re really proud of what we&#8217;ve done. It&#8217;s grown into something that has had an impact on campus.&#8221; <br/><br/><a href="https://foundation.ucsc.edu/opportunity-fund/index.html">Learn how to apply for a BOF grant.</a>&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4eef798e807270172739340f55b7c9ce"><name>janet-yellen-foundation-medal</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Janet Yellen: Honoring a living legend</title><summary>Janet Yellen, widely regarded as one of the most successful Federal Reserve chairs in history, will receive the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal at a ceremony in Menlo Park next month. &#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of California President Janet Napolitano will make a special appearance at the ceremony, which takes place on Saturday, February 2, at Hotel Nia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellen, who headed the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will receive an award that recognizes individuals of exceptionally distinguished achievement whose work and contribution to society exemplify the vision and ideals of UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz economics professor and alumnus Michael Hutchison (Merrill &#8217;76, economics) &#160;described Yellen as a brilliant economist, teacher and mentor.&#160;</span></p>
<p>"Janet Yellen embodies all of the best personal characteristics associated with the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal-- a lifelong commitment to excellence in higher education and public service,'' Hutchison continued. "Her career as an <span class="il">economist</span>, professor and policymaker in government service spans almost fifty years, and in each stage she has enlightened, inspired and challenged those around her."<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is also noted for her patient, measured, and accessible explanations of monetary policy while being a thoughtful leader of the Federal Reserve.&#160;</span></p>
<p>"Perhaps the most challenging task of her career to date has been leading the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, both as Vice Chair and Chair, during 2010-2018," Hutchison said. "She took the reins at the Board when the nation was in deepest recession since the 1930s, as the Federal Reserve was struggling to get the economy moving and financial system back on its feet. She ended her stint eight years later with a booming economy, very low unemployment and a robust financial and banking system, all the while threading a delicate path between establishing a robust economy without igniting inflation."<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;During her tenure on the Fed, some considered her the most powerful and influential woman in America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before becoming the first woman to head the Federal Reserve, she served as vice chair of the Federal Reserve, CEO and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors under President Bill Clinton, and professor at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellen also has a long association with the University of California, and has worked closely with UC Santa Cruz economics faculty. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco from 2004 to 2010, she was very supportive of UC Santa Cruz's Santa Cruz Institute for International Economics, and the SF Fed co-sponsored several of its economic conferences. In 2006, she delivered the conference&#8217;s keynote address, "Monetary Policy in a Global Environment."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carl Walsh, UC Santa Cruz distinguished professor of economics and an expert on central banking and monetary policy, counts Yellen as an important influence on his research. Walsh said that her work, in conjunction with Yellen&#8217;s husband and frequent co-author George Akerlof, contributed to the understanding of economic fluctuations and unemployment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellen&#8217;s academic contributions, especially her studies on unemployment, were directly relevant to policy issues she faced while heading the Federal Reserve during the recovery from the Great Recession of 2008&#8211;09, Walsh noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Her understanding of the costs of excessive unemployment was crucial in ensuring the Fed, under her leadership, adopted a slow and steady pace for raising interest rates that allowed unemployment to continue to fall to levels not seen since the late 1960s,&#8221; Walsh said.</span></p>

A significant portion of that farmland, however, is likely to be retired in the coming decades due to groundwater overdraft, soil salinity, and climate change.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">A new study led by researchers at UC Santa Cruz looked at the conservation potential of marginal farmland in the San Joaquin Desert and found that restoration of fallowed farmland could play a crucial role in habitat protection and restoration strategies for the blunt-nosed leopard lizard and other endangered species.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The study, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210766">published January 15 in </a></span><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210766"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>PLOS ONE</i></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, focused on the endangered blunt-nosed leopard lizard as an "umbrella species" whose habitat needs overlap with other threatened and endangered species in the San Joaquin Desert. The researchers identified more than 600 square kilometers of farmland with strong potential for habitat restoration.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"These lands were continuously fallowed for three years of the recent California megadrought, which is a good indicator that they are likely to be retired from agricultural use over the coming decades. With proper planning and a strategic fallowing program, land managers have a good opportunity to restore lands in a way that optimizes habitat for endangered species," said first author Joseph Stewart, who conducted the study as part of his Ph.D. thesis research at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The study included a quantitative assessment of habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change impacts, habitat protection, and reintroduction opportunities for the blunt-nosed leopard lizard. The researchers found that there has been ongoing loss of leopard lizard habitat, despite its listing as an endangered species. In fact, the total amount of habitat lost since it was first listed is greater than the amount of habitat currently protected through public ownership and conservation easements. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In the midst of this downward trend in intact habitat, the emerging trend toward retirement of marginal farmland presents an opportunity to reclaim land for habitat restoration, Stewart said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">For many of the region's endangered species, including the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, sandy and alkaline soils that are least productive for agriculture appear to be ideal for conservation purposes, in part because they support less growth of exotic grasses and other invasive plants. One of the study's findings was that invasive plants had caused the range of the blunt-nosed leopard lizard to contract along the wetter margins of its historical range.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The San Joaquin Desert encompasses the western and southern two-thirds of the San Joaquin Valley, as well as the adjacent Carrizo Plain and Cuyama Valley. According to Stewart, retirement of farmland in the San Joaquin Desert has been projected to reach more than 2,000 square kilometers over the next three decades. The factors driving this include the build-up of salts in irrigated desert soils, reduced water availability and increased evaporation due to climate change, and the need to bring an area of historical groundwater overdraft into compliance with California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Stewart noted that both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife have funds available to acquire habitat for endangered species. In addition, he said, the Nature Conservancy is interested in the opportunities for habitat restoration in this region.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"Conservation of intact habitat is always preferable, but if that can be done in tandem with restoration of lands that are no longer viable for agriculture, the potential is there to set aside some large areas and hopefully delist some of these endangered species," Stewart said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In addition to Stewart, the coauthors of the paper include Barry Sinervo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz; H. Scott Butterfield at the Nature Conservancy; Jonathan Richmond at the U.S. Geological Survey; David Germano at Cal State Bakersfield; and Michael Westphal at the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="52d41ab9807270171e737f60ae86ff10"><name>blood-drive</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>SAB blood drive on Jan. 30</title><start-date>1547020800000</start-date><display-name>Blood drive</display-name><path>/2019/01/blood-drive</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/01/blood-drive</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1547577857885</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1547590979505</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Greetings from the Staff Advisory Board (SAB) and Happy New Year!</p>

Expected to see first light in early 2019, the telescope is a prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (pSCT) designed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), the next generation ground-based observatory for gamma-ray astronomy at very high energies. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">David Williams, a researcher in the <a href="http://scipp.ucsc.edu/">Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics</a> (SCIPP) at UC Santa Cruz, chairs the CTA-US Consortium. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The inauguration of the pSCT is an exciting moment for the institutions involved in its development and construction,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;The first of its kind in the history of gamma-ray telescopes, the SCT design is expected to boost CTA performance towards the theoretical limit of the technology.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The CTA Observatory, for which construction will begin in 2019, will be the world&#8217;s largest and most sensitive high-energy gamma-ray observatory, with more than 100 telescopes located in the northern and southern hemispheres.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">T</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">he 9.7-m</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">eter</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> aperture pSCT </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">is</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> a pathfinder telescope for use in the </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">CTA and exploits a novel optical design</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">. </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Its</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> complex dual-mirror optical system improves on the single-mirror designs traditionally used in gamma-ray telescopes by dramatically enhancing the optical quality of their focused light over a large region of the sky, and by enabling the use of compact, highly-efficient photo-sensors in the telescope camera.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Ultimately, the SCT is designed to improve CTA&#8217;s ability to detect very-high-energy gamma-ray sources, which may also be sources of neutrinos and gravitational waves,&#8221; said Vladimir Vassiliev, </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">p</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">rincipal </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">i</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">nvestigator </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">of the</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> pSCT. &#8220;Once the SCT technology is demonstrated at FLWO, it is hoped that SCTs will become a part of at least one of the two CTA arrays, located in each of the northern and southern hemispheres.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The CTA Observatory (CTAO) will consist of 118 telescopes</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> of three different sizes and is expected to detect sources of gamma rays in the energy range 20 GeV to 300 TeV, with about ten times increased sensitivity compared to any current observatory. Notable for providing improved gamma-ray angular resolution and its very-high-resolution camera (</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">more than </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">11,000 pixels), the SCT is proposed for the medium-sized CTA telescopes and will primarily contribute to the middle of CTA&#8217;s energy range (80 GeV </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">to</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> 50 TeV).</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The SCT and other telescopes at CTA will greatly improve upon current gamma-ray research being conducted at HAWC, HESS, MAGIC, and VERITAS, the last of which is located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory,&#8221; said </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">VERITAS Director</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> Wystan Benbow. &#8220;Gamma-ray observatories like VERITAS have been operating for 12 to 16 years, and their many successes have brought very-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy into the mainstream, and have made many exciting discoveries. We hope CTA will supersede VERITAS around 2023, and it will be used to continue to build upon the 50 years of gamma-ray research at the Whipple Observatory and elsewhere.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Whipple Observatory is operated by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The SCT optical design was first conceptualized by U.S. members of CTA in 2006, and the construction of the pSCT was funded in 2012.&#160;The member institutions of the CTA-US Consortium include the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://www.physics.ucsc.edu/">Department of Physics</a> and the <a href="http://scipp.ucsc.edu/">Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics</a>. Preparation of the pSCT site at the base of Mt. Hopkins in Amado, AZ, began in late 2014, and the steel structure was assembled on site in 2016.

<p>The anthropology doctoral student has worked on this issue for years both in and out of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s work I feel personally and intimately invested in,&#8221; Hanson said. &#8220;Sexual violence can affect a lot of us in many ways. From personal experiences, it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s always been there, something I&#8217;m concerned about.&#8221;</p>
<p>While enrolled in graduate school at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where she eventually earned a master&#8217;s degree in anthropology and certificate in women&#8217;s and gender studies, she conducted research in India about feminist legal advocacy against sexual violence. During three summers between 2015 and 2017, she interviewed women&#8217;s organizations, student activist and lawyers, covering such topics as changes to the country&#8217;s rape law, protests around curfews for women at Delhi University and the operations of women&#8217;s crisis centers.</p>
<p>Here in Santa Cruz, where she arrived in 2016, she competed a 65-hour sexual assault advocacy training course. She also conducted ethnographic field research on the UC campus and community responses to sexual violence and Title IX, a federal law prohibiting sex discrimination, including sexual violence and harassment, at any educational organization that receives federal funding.</p>
<p>She now serves as UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s graduate student representative on the UC systemwide Title IX Student Advisory Board. The board strives to make sure student voices are heard and that UC handles sexual harassment and sexual assault claims in a transparent and compassionate matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am really committed to ensuring graduate student perspectives and experiences are foregrounded,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Often when the university talks about &#8216;students,&#8217; undergraduates are the default. Yet graduate students have to navigate multiple and complex positionalities&#8212;as students/advisees, peers, employees, teachers&#8212;that can make our vulnerabilities to and means of addressing sexual violence and sexual harassment quite different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hanson pointed out that graduate students work closely with a few faculty members who are critical to helping them make connections and get jobs. &#8220;They could have a say on whether you work in the field in the future,&#8221; she said.<span></span></p>
<p><span>Hanson has given talks about Title IX policies and campus resources and hosts office hours from 12&#8211;2 p.m. Tuesdays at the Graduate Student Commons, where students can ask questions and offer suggestions about how better to enforce Title IX.</span></p>
<p>As part of her work as graduate student researcher for Beyond Compliance, Hanson is developing an education and prevention program for faculty that will include student victim experiences. She wants to give faculty members tools about how to compassionately assist students who may share their experience and how to intervene when they see a colleague engaging in troubling behavior such as flirting with a student.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beyond Compliance really situates faculty as responsible for initiating and sustaining this conversation,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Hanson believes that the recent high-profile sexual harassment cases at UC Santa Cruz demonstrate the need for faculty to intervene in their colleagues&#8217; bad behavior rather than close ranks. &#8220;There are serious fears about retaliation that inhibit students&#8212;and grad students in particular&#8212;from reporting,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>To make Beyond Compliance a reality, the university will have to address several policy gaps, including a more robust anti-retaliation clause, she said.</p>
<p>Other needed changes include making sure harassment investigations are completed in the allotted time frame and increasing transparency so faculty and students know what is being done to address sexual violence, Hanson said.</p>
<p>Hanson said she wouldn&#8217;t work on Beyond Compliance if she didn&#8217;t think it would help the university climate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Calling for a cultural change or cultural shift is a big thing and it&#8217;s a slow process but I think there can be real short-term and long-term changes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The actual work Beyond Compliance is doing can have a real impact.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5dd7bac3807270171e737f60eb4f74fc"><name>saturn-rings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Waves in Saturn's rings give precise measurement of planet's rotation rate</title><summary>Saturn's ring system acts as a sensitive seismograph, enabling scientists to measure the giant planet's vibrations and determine its rotation rate.</summary><keywords>Jonathan Fortney</keywords><start-date>1547823600000</start-date><display-name>Waves in Saturn's rings give precise measurement of planet's rotation rate</display-name><path>/2019/01/saturn-rings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/01/saturn-rings</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1547762644871</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1547825905463</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/saturn-rings-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/saturn-rings-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>saturn-rings-410.jpg</name><display-name>saturn-rings-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>37954</file-size><width>410</width><height>345</height></image><image-alt>rings of saturn</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/saturn-rings-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/saturn-rings-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>saturn-rings-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>saturn-rings-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>13532</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>rings of saturn</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>This image of Saturn's rings was taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft on Sept. 13, 2017.

The length of a day on Saturn, according to their calculations, is 10 hours 33 minutes and 38 seconds.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The researchers studied wave patterns created within Saturn's rings by the planet's internal vibrations. In effect, the rings act as an extremely sensitive seismograph by responding to vibrations within the planet itself.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Similar to Earth's vibrations from an earthquake, Saturn responds to perturbations by vibrating at frequencies determined by its internal structure. Heat-driven convection in the interior is the most likely source of the vibrations. These internal oscillations cause the density at any particular place within the planet to fluctuate, which makes the gravitational field outside the planet oscillate at the same frequencies.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"Particles in the rings feel this oscillation in the gravitational field. At places where this oscillation resonates with ring orbits, energy builds up and gets carried away as a wave," explained Christopher Mankovich, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Mankovich is lead author of a paper, </span><a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aaf798/meta"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">published January 17 in the </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Astrophysical Journal</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>,</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> comparing the wave patterns in the rings with models of Saturn's interior structure. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Most of the waves observed in Saturn's rings are due to the gravitational effects of the moons orbiting outside the rings, said coauthor Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. "But some of the features in the rings are due to the oscillations of the planet itself, and we can use those to understand the planet's internal oscillations and internal structure," he said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Mankovich developed a set of models of the internal structure of Saturn, used them to predict the frequency spectrum of Saturn's internal vibrations, and compared those predictions with the waves observed by </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Cassini</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> in Saturn's C ring. One of the main results of his analysis is the new calculation of Saturn's rotation rate, which has been surprisingly difficult to measure. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">As a gas giant planet, Saturn has no solid surface with landmarks that could be tracked as it rotates. Saturn is also unusual in having its magnetic axis nearly perfectly aligned with its rotational axis. Jupiter's magnetic axis, like Earth's, is not aligned with its rotational axis, which means the magnetic pole swings around as the planet rotates, enabling astronomers to measure a periodic signal in radio waves and calculate the rotation rate. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The rotation rate of 10:33:38 determined by Mankovich's analysis is several minutes faster than previous estimates based on radiometry from the </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Voyager</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> and </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Cassini</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> spacecraft. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"We now have the length of Saturn's day, when we thought we wouldn't be able to find it," said Cassini Project Scientist Linda Spilker. "They used the rings to peer into Saturn's interior, and out popped this long-sought, fundamental quality of the planet. And it's a really solid result. The rings held the answer."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The idea that Saturn's rings could be used to study the seismology of the planet was first suggested in 1982, long before the necessary observations were possible. Coauthor Mark Marley, now at NASA's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, subsequently fleshed out the idea for his Ph.D. thesis in 1990, showed how the calculations could be done, and predicted where features in Saturn's rings would be. He also noted that the Cassini mission, then in the planning stages, would be able to make the observations needed to test the idea.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"Two decades later, people looked at the Cassini data and found ring features at the locations of Mark's predictions," Fortney said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In addition to Mankovich, Marley, and Fortney, UCSC postdoctoral researcher Naor Movshovitz also contributed to the paper. This research was supported by NASA and the University of California.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5ee96419807270171e737f6098c99381"><name>klemola-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Arnold Klemola (1931–2019)</title><summary>Arnold Klemola, a long-time staff researcher at UC Observatories, passed away on January 5, 2019.

He was 87.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Dr. Klemola was the first in his family to attend college. He earned an undergraduate degree in astronomy from Indiana University and a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in 1962, with Lick Astronomer Stanislaus Vasilevskis as his thesis advisor. After graduation, Klemola worked in Argentina for the Yale-San Juan Southern Proper Motion Survey until 1967 when he joined the staff of Lick Observatory, where he served until his retirement in 1992. After retirement he remained an active researcher at Lick up through the end of 2018.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Klemola&#8217;s collegiality and generosity with his time were widely appreciated in the Observatory and the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. He will be remembered for his kindness, very careful work, and generosity throughout his long and distinguished scientific career at Lick Observatory and UC Santa Cruz. In 2016, Klemola made a </span></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/02/klemola-gift.html"><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">very generous donation</span></span></a></u></span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> that endowed the James Keeler Fund to support the research of astronomy and astrophysics graduate students at UC Santa Cruz. His goal for the Keeler Fund was to attract capable students from all backgrounds to astronomy and help them succeed. It is perhaps fitting that comet Klemola will make a return in November, 2019.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Klemola was an expert in precision measurements of stellar positions and motions. In Argentina, he was instrumental in putting into operation a telescope specifically aimed at this kind of work. Upon returning to Lick he was instrumental in the completion of the multi-decade-long Lick Northern Proper Motion Survey. He and his colleagues Robert Hanson and Burton Jones (who helped compile the following summary of Klemola&#8217;s scientific work) measured the proper motions of about 300,000 Milky Way stars and the positions of around 70,000 galaxies, putting the motions of the stars onto a fundamental reference frame. This program led to a much better understanding of the various constituent components of the Milky Way galaxy and was one of the early research programs that demonstrated large-scale structure in the distributions of galaxies through space.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Because of his expertise in measuring stellar positions, Klemola was in great demand as a collaborator. He produced catalogs of stellar positions used to predict occultations of stars by asteroids and by the moons of the outer planets. The shapes of the moons could often be determined by these occultations. He produced a catalog of positions of faint stars along the path of Halley&#8217;s comet, work that led to the precise determination of the position of the comet, and helped make midcourse corrections to the spacecraft trying to make a close approach to the comet.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Klemola worked on many other topics, from identifying the optical counterparts of gamma-ray bursts to the orbits of comets. He made some of the early proper motion measurements of globular clusters, from which orbits could be determined and the mass of the Milky Way&#8217;s halo could be measured. Probably one of the most interesting projects was his collaboration with Burton Jones and Douglas Lin in the measurement of the motion of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby companion galaxy to the Milky way. It was the first time any such motion was measured for any external galaxy. This result stood among the most accurate for many years.</span></span></p>

<p>The Harold Jeffreys Lecture is given annually by a distinguished and eloquent speaker on a topic in geophysics. Nimmo is an expert in determining the origin and evolution of solid body surfaces and interiors from observations and geophysical modeling.</p>
<p>The RAS announcement of the lectureship described Nimmo as "the pre-eminent geophysicist in the world in the study of solid icy bodies. In the past twenty years, he has played a major role in the interpretation of Titan, Enceladus, Europa, Pluto, and other outer Solar System bodies, primarily through the analysis of data from the <em>Cassini</em> and <em>New Horizon</em> missions."</p>
<p>Nimmo's approach builds on classic geophysical techniques such as those that relate topography and gravity field, and interpretations of surface morphology. He has established many collaborations with geologists, geochemists, and cosmochemists, which has enabled a range of striking new discoveries, including the confirmation of an internal ocean in Saturn's moon Enceladus and the reorientation of Enceladus.</p>
<p>Nimmo earned his Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge, followed by appointments at the University of Cambridge, University College London, and UCLA. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2005.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6361dfc2807270171e737f60c7ef4ad7"><name>data-democracy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Questions That Matter public humanities series to spotlight ‘Data and Democracy’ at Kuumbwa Center </title><summary>The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz  will present "Data and Democracy"—the fifth installment of its signature Questions That Matter series—on Tuesday, January 29, at Kuumbwa Jazz Center in downtown Santa Cruz.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz news, ucsc news, data and democracy, lise getoor, pranav anand, politics, the humanities institute, questins that matter</keywords><start-date>1547857500000</start-date><display-name>Data and Democracy</display-name><path>/2019/01/data-democracy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/01/data-democracy</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1547855584385</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1548480613978</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value><value>Linguistics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/use-this-working-image-350.png</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/use-this-working-image-350.png</link><site>news</site><name>use-this-working-image-350.png</name><display-name>use-this-working-image-350.png</display-name><file-size>240006</file-size><width>350</width><height>503</height></image><image-alt>ucsc humanities data and democracy poster</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/datademocracy-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/datademocracy-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>datademocracy-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>datademocracy-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18193</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa  Cruz THI Data and Democracy poster</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/pranav-anand-360.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/pranav-anand-360.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pranav-anand-360.jpg</name><display-name>pranav-anand-360.jpg</display-name><file-size>191936</file-size><width>360</width><height>357</height></image><image-alt>Pranav Anand</image-alt><image-caption><span style="caret-color: #222222;

<p>The evening will feature a conversation with associate professor of linguistics<span>&#160;</span><strong>Pranav Anand</strong><span>&#160;</span>and professor of computer science and engineering <strong>Lise Getoor</strong>, moderated by history professor and Humanities Institute director<span>&#160;</span><strong>Nathaniel Deutsch</strong>.</p>
<p>The<span>&#160;</span><em>Questions That Matter</em><span>&#160;</span>series is designed to bring together UC Santa Cruz faculty with community residents and students to explore the big questions that matter to everyone. It is part of a strategic initiative of<span>&#160;</span>The Humanities Institute to champion the role and value of the humanities in contemporary life.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to look at what are some of the core elements of modern democracy, the way that data has changed and who has access to it, and how this has the potential to transform our democracy,&#8221; said Deutsch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there has to be a collaboration between humanists and technologists to address these issues,&#8221; he added. &#8220;There&#8217;s a growing awareness that new developments in technology require greater input from humanists in order to ensure the impacts of technology are positive and instructive, and don&#8217;t create new forms of injustice&#8230;humanists need to actually play a collaborative role in designing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deutsch noted that the role of humanities is to be present at all stages of technological development as a collaborator&#8212;questioning for example how algorithms are written and composed, how they&#8217;re implemented, and how they&#8217;re regulated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think its really important for the humanities not to have a passive relationship with technology,&#8221; said Deutsch. &#8220;And I think these are issues that need to be thought about across the university, not just in the sciences or humanities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Associate professor of linguistics <strong>Pranav Anand</strong> is an expert in semantics, pragmatics, syntax, and computational linguistics. His research focuses largely on two matters: how context intrudes into or guides the interpretive process, and how perspective is represented across the world's languages.</p>
<p>Anand&#8217;s central interest is the class of subjective expressions--those that talk about stance, mood, affect, belief, desire, judgment, and appraisal-- which allow us to introduce other's perspectives on the world into our conversations.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Lise Getoor</strong> is a professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at UC Santa Cruz and the director of the&#160;UC Santa Cruz D3 Data Science Center.&#160;Her research areas include machine learning and reasoning under uncertainty, data management, visual analytics, and social network analysis.</p>
<p>Getoor is interested in the development of the foundations for responsible data science&#8212;exploring such questions as how to understand the ethical and justice issues involved in data-driven decision-making, and how to integrate algorithmic and statistical principles, social science theories, and basic humanist concepts so that we can think critically and constructively about the socio-technical systems we are building.</p>

With a reinvigorated Division of Global Engagement and the development of a campus Strategic Academic Plan, now is the time to develop a campus internationalization plan for connecting students, faculty, and communities across the globe.</p>
<p>I am excited to announce that our participation in the American Council on Education (ACE) <a href="https://www.acenet.edu/news-room/Pages/ACE-Internationalization-Laboratory.aspx">Internationalization Lab</a> is off to a great start and steadily progressing. This effort will support the development of comprehensive internationalization strategies for our campus with the goal of integrating global perspectives in all areas of teaching, research, and scholarship, and leveraging the possibilities to move forward the Strategic Academic Plan.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/ace/announcement.html">announced this effort in November</a>. CP/EVC Tromp <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/files/ace-internationalization-lab-steering-committee.pdf">formed and charged</a> a new Internationalization Lab steering committee, a partnership with the Academic Senate. The steering committee is carrying out a comprehensive review of the current state of the UCSC&#8217;s internationalization activities with the goal of identifying priorities for internationalization on our campus and proposing a realistic plan for implementing them. <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/ace/steering-committee.html">Steering committee membership</a> is designed to be representative of faculty in as many disciplinary and functional areas as possible.</p>
<p>Throughout the winter quarter, the steering committee is collecting data about current internationalization views and activities across campus. Committee members are visiting department meetings to engage with faculty in person and learn more about their internationalization efforts and challenges. Additionally, the committee is distributing a <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/ace/documents/questionnaire-department-chairs.html">questionnaire to department chairs</a> that seeks more detailed information about departmental successes, and any barriers to expanding future internationalization efforts.</p>
<p>As we look ahead to the spring and summer, the steering committee will be engaging in an analysis of the data collected to identify campus priorities and formulate recommendations.</p>
<p>We are all excited to hear from departments across campus regarding current and past internationalization activities, and your ideas about where we might direct our future efforts. For individuals interested in this strategic planning process, the <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/ace/index.html">ACE Internationalization Lab website</a> provides details about the lab, timeline, documents, and related information. We will be updating the site regularly as the process unfolds. If you have ACE Internationalization Lab questions or comments, please feel free to contact global@ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="773ec88a807270171e737f603d5046d9"><name>in-memoriam-mortenson</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: John Mortenson</title><start-date>1548057600000</start-date><display-name>https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/santacruzsentinel/obituary.aspx?n=john-keith-mortenson&amp;pid=191318705</display-name><path>/2019/01/in-memoriam-mortenson</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/01/in-memoriam-mortenson</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1548188828872</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1548193999297</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/mortenson-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/mortenson-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mortenson-500px.jpg</name><display-name>mortenson-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>180795</file-size><width>500</width><height>515</height></image><image-alt>John Mortenson</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>John Keith Mortenson, a founding staff member at UC Santa Cruz, died on Jan. 10 in Salem, Oregon.</p>

<p>Pitney Bowes informed us a year ago it was exiting the postal kiosk business and would continue to service the equipment until parts for it were no longer available, reserving the right to terminate our agreement on a month&#8217;s notice. Unfortunately, we received this notice earlier this month.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Procurement and Supply Chain Services has attempted, without success, to identify a suitable, cost-effective replacement. But, much like what happened to the film photography processing business, the postal kiosk business is in decline with only a few costly, mixed-quality options available. Considering the situation and the limited use of the kiosk, the student fee funding subsidizing the service would seem to be better used supporting other, higher priority student-related services.</p>
<p>The USPS mailbox located near Bay Tree Plaza remains in place. Other postage and shipping options include the following:</p>
<h3>ONLINE POSTAGE AND SHIPPING</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.usps.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI98jGzO3y3wIVWyCtBh1IDQnaEAAYASAAEgKdn_D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">United States Postal Service Mail &amp; Shipping Services</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Mail Services is preparing a <a href="https://www.cms.ucsc.edu/postal-kiosk/index.html">webpage</a>, currently under development, that will provide information on how students can ship parcels from campus using on-line USPS Mail and Shipping Services tools. This information is expected to be available by the end of the month.</p>
<h3>NEARBY SHIPPING LOCATIONS</h3>
<ul>
<li>UPS Store, 859 Almar Ave, Suite C (near Safeway)</li>
<li>US Post Office, 850 Front Street</li>
<li>FedEx Print and Ship Center, 712 Front Street</li>
</ul>
<p>Shipping and mailing of campus business letters and parcels will remain unaffected. Mail Services staff will continue to pick up and deliver these items. Please contact Procurement and Supply Chain Services Director Darin Matthews (darin@ucsc.edu) should you have questions.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Kirk Lew, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Financial Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7bfef485807270171e737f60b4f121c7"><name>perry-newsom</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gov.

Gavin Newsom has appointed <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/year-of-alumni-perry-kris.html">UC Santa Cruz alumna Kris Perry</a>, a nationally recognized advocate for children, to a key post in his new administration.</p>
<p>Perry (Merrill College '86, B.A.s sociology and psychology) has been named deputy secretary for early childhood development of the California Health and Human Services Agency and senior advisor to the governor on implementation of early childhood development initiatives. Newsom, who announced the appointment Jan. 21, has made helping the state's youngest residents one of his top policy priorities. He has proposed more than $1.7 billion for expanded early childhood education and interventions.</p>
<p>Perry, 54, began her career as a child-abuse investigator and spent nearly 25 years as a social worker and director of social service programs. In 2005, she was named executive director of First 5 California. Seven years later, she moved to Washington, D.C., as executive director of the First Five Years Fund, a national bipartisan advocacy group that supports the education and care needs of low-income children from birth through age 5. Most recently, she served as president of Save the Children Action Network (SCAN).</p>
<p>In 2009, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/06/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-perry.html">Perry</a> stepped into the national spotlight as the lead plaintiff in the historic legal challenge that overturned California's ban on gay marriage. That case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which legalized same-sex marriage in 2013.</p>
<p>In 2017, Perry received the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/03/perry-award.html">Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award</a> and was honored at a public reception in her honor. "I woke up politically at Santa Cruz," she said of her undergraduate years on campus. During a 2017 interview, she said she was heartened to see the country moving toward a more values-based approach&#8212;and to see people inspired to work in government "to change the system from within."</p>
<p>"It's hard to see government maligned, when in fact government service is noble and profound," she said.</p>
<p>Perry and her wife Sandy Stier are coauthors of the memoir <em>Love on Trial: Our Supreme Court Fight for the Right to Marry</em>. Their son, Elliott, graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2017.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/kris-perry-to.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/kris-perry-to.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kris-perry-to.jpg</name><file-size>7307</file-size><width>344</width><height>140</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Kris Perry</thumb-alt><title>Gov.

<p>The film is one of 50 projects by 58 individual artists that were selected from a pool of more than 5,200 applications.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s winners are based in 15 different states and territories, from New York to California and Puerto Rico to Washington, spanning a wide range of genres, including literature, performance, the visual arts, moving image, technology, and socially engaged art.</p>
<p>Each project will receive up to $50,000 in project funding, and a long-term commitment of advisory and career development.</p>
<p><em>Run with It</em> tells the story of De'Jaun, a young black man on the Dean's List at Morehouse College, who grew up spinning quarters on death row with his uncle, Troy Davis. He also attended Amnesty International protests with his mother, Martina, who fought for 20 years to prove her brother Troy&#8217;s innocence.&#160;At 19, Troy&#160;was accused of killing a white police officer in one of the most controversial, racially charged cases to go before the courts.</p>
<p>The multigenerational story is both a legal investigation into Troy&#8217;s case and an intimate look at the impacts of a death sentence on his family and the whole community.</p>
<p><strong>Hibbert-Jones creates </strong>documentary films with Talisman that explore the crisis in the criminal justice system and the U.S. racial divide, blending animation, documentation, and the aesthetics of the graphic novel.&#160;</p>
<p>Their most recent animated documentary short, <em>Last Day of Freedom</em>, was nominated for an Academy Award for &#8220;Best Documentary Short&#8221; in 2016. It also received the International Documentary Association &#8220;Best Short&#8221; award, as well as a regional Emmy.</p>
<p>The film additionally screened at 30 international festivals, and won 12 festival awards.</p>
<p>Hibbert-Jones teaches sculpture, public art and digital art new media at UC Santa Cruz, and advises in film and social documentary.&#160;Her short film, installations, and new media projects have been exhibited worldwide in exhibitions, museums and festivals; broadcast internationally; and shown on Netflix.</p>
<p>Hibbert-Jones&#8217;s work can also be found in collections ranging from the Israeli Center for Digital Art to the Academy of Motion Picture Art and Sciences. And in 2016, she was honored with a <em>United States Congressional Black Caucus Veterans Braintrust Award</em>&#160;in recognition for&#160;her&#160;outstanding national commitment to&#160;civil rights, and social justice.</p>
<p><strong>Hibbert-Jones and Talisman</strong> were also recently awarded a 12-month artist residency this year at FilmHouse--SFFILM&#8217;s vibrant shared workspace for independent filmmakers, which supports both narrative and documentary films by providing yearlong residencies for filmmakers actively engaged in various stages of production.</p>
<p>In addition to workspace, FilmHouse residents are provided with dedicated rooms for writing and editing their features, plus special access to established industry professionals offering mentorship and artistic guidance from their various areas of expertise.</p>

<p><span>The work could lead to integrated &#8220;lab-on-chip&#8221; systems programmable to complete multiple tasks and achieve precise control of bioparticles (such as cells, bacteria, or exosomes) in a solution environment, Yanik said. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Like electrons and photons, a phonon is a quasiparticle, a particle derived from collective vibrations of atoms in solids. The ability to control electrons and photons led to major breakthroughs, including inventions such as the transistor, computer, camera, laser, and fiber optics. Yanik and others believe that the ability to control and manipulate phonons in artificially created phononic materials could lead to similar revolutionary breakthroughs. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The idea behind my research is to use phononic metamaterials to push the boundaries of today&#8217;s acousto-microfluidic technologies beyond conventional standing-wave devices,&#8221; said Yanik, who laid the theoretical and experimental framework for the proposed research through a prior NSF award and has demonstrated practical uses of phononic metamaterials in microfluidics for the first time. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Microfluidics is a relatively new technology in which a tiny volume of fluid moves through a microdevice. By applying a force to the fluid as it flows through the device, bioparticles within the fluid can be detected, separated, sorted, or isolated. One promising force is acoustic radiation force, which is non-invasive and non-harmful to cells. However, acoustic radiation has so far been limited to size-based bioparticle manipulation. In biomedical applications, it is often desirable to separate or isolate cells based on other characteristics, such as cell type or binding affinity.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Because of the limitations of any one particular force or physical mechanism, multiple physical mechanisms are often required to achieve an overall objective. For example, one physical mechanism might detect a particular type of cell, while another mechanism separates larger cells from smaller cells, and yet another isolates and holds a particular cell type. This can result in fragmentation of on-chip technologies to multiple platforms and pose a fundamental bottleneck from a practical perspective, Yanik said. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>By creating a &#8220;toolkit&#8221; that offers a full set of diagnostic operations including sample processing, size- and affinity-based cell sorting, actuation, trapping, and detection, Yanik's research could &#8220;open the door to a new world of lab-on-chip biomedical technologies,&#8221; he said. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>A critical aspect of his research is that ionic-type phononic metamaterials offer a third degree of freedom (frequency) to conventional two-dimensional surface acoustic wave devices. This third dimension offers frequency-dependent characteristics and enables frequency-coded functionality. His research program aims to transform conventional surface acoustic (phononic) approaches from a &#8220;flatland&#8221; with limited design flexibility to a three-dimensional space that offers unprecedented level of control and flexibility in design and integration. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>In other words, with a 3-dimensional device such as the one Yanik proposes to develop, a single platform could be programmed to carry out multiple tasks, eliminating the need for multiple devices. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I want to understand the advantages and technical issues associated with phononic metamaterials, which will lead to a deeper insight into their unprecedented potential for more involved schemes of acoustofluidic particle manipulation for biomedical applications,&#8221; Yanik said. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The CAREER awards are NSF&#8217;s most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Yanik has made key contributions in the areas of biosensor and lab-on-a-chip development. His research focuses on nanoplasmonic biosensors for viral and bacterial pathogen detection, optofluidic bio-NEMS for disease diagnostics, rare cell isolation techniques, and nanophotonics and plasmonic device engineering. He received his Ph.D. degree in applied theoretical physics in 2007 from Purdue University and was a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard Medical School before coming to UC Santa Cruz. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="823eea97807270171e737f601b87924f"><name>manga-data-release</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>MaNGA data release includes detailed maps of thousands of nearby galaxies</title><summary>Major data release from Sloan Digital Sky Survey includes galaxy maps, new data access and visualization tools, and a huge 'stellar library'.</summary><keywords>Kevin Bundy</keywords><start-date>1548774000000</start-date><display-name>MaNGA data release includes detailed maps of thousands of nearby galaxies</display-name><path>/2019/01/manga-data-release</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/01/manga-data-release</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1548373387063</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1549406254123</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="231" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HuDD7NHjSHs" width="410"></iframe></embed><width>410</width><caption>MaNGA principal investigator Kevin Bundy describes the project in this video.</caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/marvin-galaxies-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/marvin-galaxies-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>marvin-galaxies-410.jpg</name><display-name>marvin-galaxies-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>89538</file-size><width>410</width><height>397</height></image><image-alt>16 galaxy images from MaNGA dataset</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/marvin-galaxies-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/marvin-galaxies-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>marvin-galaxies-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>marvin-galaxies-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17534</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>four galaxy images</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The MaNGA data set will eventually include more than 10,000 nearby galaxies, and the survey is already more than half way toward that goal.

<p>MaNGA uses a technique called resolved spectroscopy to study galaxies in much greater detail than previous surveys. Spectroscopy is a powerful tool for astronomers, yielding a wealth of information by measuring how much light an object emits at different wavelengths. In the past, astronomers typically acquired just one spectrum for each galaxy, but resolved spectroscopy (also called integral field spectroscopy) obtains hundreds of separate spectra covering every location within the galaxy.</p>
<p>"Resolved spectroscopy allows us to dissect a galaxy and study its internal composition and the motions of its stars and gas," explained MaNGA principal investigator Kevin Bundy, an associate researcher at UC Observatories and adjunct professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"People have been doing resolved spectroscopy for individual galaxies, but we've never had it for thousands of galaxies, so MaNGA gives us the statistical power to address a lot of important questions," Bundy said.</p>
<p>MaNGA's goal is to understand the "life history" of present-day galaxies, from their initial birth and assembly, through their ongoing growth via star formation and mergers, to their death from "quenching" of star formation at late times. Bundy and his students at UC Santa Cruz, for example, have discovered evidence in the MaNGA data for outflows of hot ionized gas in "dead" galaxies, supporting the idea that powerful winds driven out from a galaxy's central black hole can shut down star formation. Bundy's team is also finding clues to how galaxies were assembled over time by studying the motions of their stars and gas and by analyzing the chemical signatures of stars in different parts of galaxies.</p>
<p>One of three programs in the fourth phase of SDSS, MaNGA will eventually study a representative sample of some 10,000 nearby galaxies. Bundy said the survey is more than half way toward that goal and on track to reach it by 2020. Data from 4,621 galaxies are now publicly available as part of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02759">15th SDSS data release</a> (the third data release for SDSS-IV).</p>
<p>"This data release is a major milestone for us," Bundy said. "MaNGA is already by far the largest survey of its kind, and this release includes both the data and the analytical tools the project has developed."</p>
<p>A powerful new interface called <a href="https://www.sdss.org/dr15/manga/marvin/">Marvin</a> provides access to the MaNGA data and galaxy maps based on analyses of the data. Marvin includes a wide range of tools for searching, accessing, and visualizing the data. The <a href="https://dr15.sdss.org/marvin/">Marvin web site</a> offers easy access to a wealth of information about each galaxy, including maps of key features such as star formation, stellar motion, emission lines, and dozens of other properties important to astronomers. Kyle Westfall, a project scientist at UC Observatories, led the development of the data analysis pipeline that produced the maps and other data products now publicly available for the first time.</p>
<p>Another important part of this data release is the <a href="https://www.sdss.org/dr15/mastar/">MaNGA Stellar Library</a> containing spectra of more than 3,000 stars in our Milky Way galaxy. When complete, it will include 5,000 to 6,000 stars. Researchers can use the spectra of these individual stars to try to reconstruct the spectrum of a galaxy and thereby figure out that galaxy's unique mix of different star types.</p>
<p>"The MaNGA Stellar Library is the largest library of stars ever compiled, with spectra from the same instruments used for the galaxies, so it's a very powerful tool for understanding the nature of the stellar populations in these galaxies," Bundy said.</p>
<p>MaNGA Survey Scientist Renbin Yan of the University of Kentucky led the development of the Stellar Library.</p>
<p>The MaNGA survey uses the two BOSS spectrographs at the 2.5-meter Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico in a novel way. Specially designed "integral field units," each composed of tightly packed arrays of optical fibers, enable the measurement of spectra at multiple points in the same galaxy. The MaNGA spectra provide continuous coverage from optical to near-infrared wavelengths.</p>
<p>Funding for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV has been provided by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, and the Participating Institutions.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="82f475f5807270171e737f60e2815353"><name>shakespeare-refugees-bauman</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'What refugees taught me about Shakespeare'</title><summary>On Jan. 31, New York theater director Jessica Bauman will come to campus for a special evening at Kresge Town Hall titled 'What Refugees Taught Me About Shakespeare.'

<p>In the process of developing her production, she worked with refugees, former refugees, and immigrants from all over the world--both in New York and at Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya.</p>
<p>On Thursday, January 31, Bauman will visit the campus for a special evening at Kresge Town Hall titled &#8220;What Refugees Taught Me About Shakespeare.&#8221; Together with UC Santa Cruz professor Cat Ramirez, she will explore the ways that the stories we hear and tell about refugees shape our responses to the worldwide migration crisis.</p>
<p>The event is presented by Shakespeare Workshop, The Humanities Institute, and Porter College. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;The essence of the work we do in Shakespeare Workshop is to demonstrate that Shakespeare belongs to everybody and that his plays are resources for thinking about the world in which we live together,&#8221; said literature professor Sean Keilen, director of Shakespeare Workshop in the The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221; When I became aware of the work that Jessica Bauman is doing, I knew that I had to bring her to Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I also knew that among our distinguished faculty, Cat Ramirez would be the perfect interlocutor for Jessica,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Cat is a scholar of race, gender, migration, and citizenship, and through her, I believe that the Workshop will be able to bring Shakespeare and Jessica's outstanding and original work with his plays to a broad audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keilen noted that while on campus, Bauman will also visit one of his undergraduate courses to discuss Shakespeare's rarely-performed&#160;play, <em>Cymbeline, </em>as an opportunity to consider the problem of individual and collective identity during a period of resurgent nationalism.</p>
<p>Bauman will also give a career development workshop for Theater Arts majors and graduate students at UC Santa Cruz, and additionally make a presentation about her work to the Saturday Shakespeare Club in Aptos, in an effort to extend the reach of Shakespeare Workshop's programming into the community.</p>
<p>A New York City-based theater and film director, producer, and teacher, Bauman is the founding artistic director of New Feet Productions. She has talked about her work on <em>Arden/Everywhere</em> in numerous venues, including Shakespeare&#8217;s Globe Theatre in London.</p>
<p>She has also taught a theater workshop to 40 refugee theater artists at Kakuma Refugee Camp with NGO Film Aid, and recently received a Theater Communications Group Global Connections Grant to collaborate with a theater in Tijuana, Mexico, on a project connected with the migration crisis there.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shakespeare Workshop</em></strong> is a joint effort by faculty and students in the Literature and Theater Arts Departments to explore questions, topics, and areas of shared concern, with both the campus community and the community off campus--using Shakespeare&#8217;s works as a common vocabulary.</p>
<p>Its recent programs have focused on a translation of Shakespeare&#8217;s sonnets into American Sign Language, prison-based productions of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays, and Shakespeare&#8217;s interest in the experience of veterans and the challenges they face when coming home from war.</p>
<p>The Workshop is also a sponsor of Weekend with Shakespeare, a summertime partnership with Santa Cruz Shakespeare, an independent theater company in Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>There has been very little in the way of innovation on the mentoring front since Odysseus sailed off to the Trojan War leaving his infant son, Telemachus, in the care of an old friend named Mentor and Odysseus&#8217;s foster brother, Eumaeus. In the epic, the goddess Athena appears in the guise of Mentor to set Telemachus back on the path of patriarchal household management when he begins to go astray. The primary qualification for the role of mentor in this story is the ability to safeguard and pass on the shared heroic values represented, if not always practiced, by Telemachus&#8217;s famously wayward father.To put this another way, neither Mentor nor Eumaeus&#8211;nor certainly Athena&#8211;were understood to need any &#8220;training&#8221; in mentoring when they stepped in to shepherd the young Greek Prince on the path to epic adulthood, a path that aimed to replicate existing values.</p>
<p>Almost three millennia later, things are beginning to change. University <a href="http://www.crlt.umich.edu/faculty/facment">teaching</a> and <a href="https://cimerproject.org/#/">research centers</a>, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/01/10/historians-and-language-professors-discuss-advising-recent-conferences#.XDebZnkEEl8.email">professional organizations</a>, and funding sources for STEM research such as the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf09_29/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2j">NSF</a> and <a href="https://oir.nih.gov/sourcebook/mentoring-training/ddir-implementation-plan-response-felcom-subcommittee-report-mentoring">NIH</a> are radically reenvisioning the preparation for and practice of mentoring in higher education. Until recently, higher education faculty and staff, like their ancient forebears, were largely left to intuit the qualities of a good mentor or to replicate the mentoring habits&#8211;skillful or unskillful&#8211;that they themselves experienced as undergraduates, graduate students, or postdoctoral researchers. The relative cultural homogeneity of institutions with graduate programs until recently meant that that form of &#8220;passed down&#8221; mentoring practice was, at least some of the time, reasonably successful.</p>
<p>Now, however, with the increase in the numbers of graduate programs and corresponding efforts to foster the intellectual and creative potential enabled by a much more culturally diverse graduate student population, not to mention the professional development approach currently reshaping higher education teaching and learning, that &#8220;replication&#8221; model is being set aside in favor of a more intentional and research-based approach to developing mentoring skills.</p>
<p>For the past year, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/">Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning</a> has been researching and developing online resources, toolkits, and workshops related to mentoring across communities of teachers and learners (faculty, postdoc, graduate student, undergraduate, and peer-to-peer). This week, CITL is sending out <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CITL_Faculty-Toolkit-for-Graduate-Student-Mentorship.pdf">mentor toolkits</a> to faculty who mentor graduate students and <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Graduate-Student-Guide-to-Mentorship-Relationships.pdf">mentee toolkits</a> to the graduate students themselves. These resources, along with tip sheets, individual development plan templates, and sample mentoring agreements, are simultaneously being made available in the <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/teaching-resources/mentoring/">Mentoring section</a> of CITL&#8217;s <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/teaching-resources/">Teaching Resources</a> website. A new workshop is also available for faculty interested in a more hands-on and discipline-specific opportunity to discuss the practice of mentoring with colleagues in their department.</p>
<p>The mentoring materials were developed through research conducted by Graduate Research Assistant Kirstin Wagner, who began her project in the Spring of 2018 by developing a <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/programs/summer-graduate-pedagogy-mentors/">peer mentoring program</a> for graduate students teaching in last year&#8217;s Summer sessions. With funding from the Graduate Division and CITL, Wagner then turned her attention to faculty-graduate student mentoring relationships, and partnered with CITL Associate Director for Programs, Kendra Dority, to develop the new toolkits, workshops, and other resources.</p>
<p>Wagner turned the recent outpouring of research and support materials into a usable format for busy graduate students and faculty wanting to improve their mentoring skills and mentorship relationships. "It&#8217;s exciting to be a part of this national surge of interest in mentoring as a means not only of increasing undergraduate and graduate student success, but also of fostering communities of care and collaboration across disciplines and levels of study. It&#8217;s been a gratifying and instructive experience to identify successful practices and useful materials being employed on other campuses and translate them to serve our unique needs,&#8221; Wagner said.</p>
<p>&#8221;Healthy mentoring relationships are known to support groundbreaking research, promote equity and inclusion, and bolster ethical scholarly endeavors,&#8221; Wagner continued. &#8220;When mentorship is a collaborative and community-oriented effort, the whole university benefits, and that&#8217;s what we are starting to see here at UC Santa Cruz."</p>
<p>Dority took a UC Santa Cruz team to a two-day institute in July 2018 to learn evidence-based mentoring practices and develop mentoring workshop facilitation skills with the <a href="https://cimerproject.org/">Center for Improved Mentoring Experiences in Research (CIMER)</a>, which focuses on improving mentorship relationships, specifically in research settings like labs and fieldwork sites. &#8220;With this training, we bring back to the campus an approach to mentorship that values the development of core, evidence-based capacities like effective communication, aligning expectations, and addressing equity and inclusion in every mentoring relationship,&#8221; Dority said.</p>
<p>CITL&#8217;s mentoring workshop for faculty, a new addition to a larger <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/workshops/">offering of workshops</a>, has been created to support mentors in developing these evidence-based mentoring competencies in all fields. &#8220;The CIMER Project&#8217;s curriculum takes an intentional approach to the specific needs of mentorship relationships in STEM fields. At the same time, we are able to translate the research-based practices in mentorship across disciplines, and attune our offerings to the needs of specific programs and departments.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 90-minute mentoring workshop is now available for faculty at department meetings and can be adapted for graduate students who want to explore the mentee role in the mentoring relationship. CITL has plans to further develop programming related to mentoring postdoctoral researchers, as well as workshops for all those on campus who mentor undergraduates, particularly in laboratory settings.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="96935960807270171e737f6032670210"><name>madeleine-allbright-mendoza</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Madeleine Albright in conversation with Pulitzer Prize-winning UCSC alumna Martha Mendoza on Feb. 5</title><summary>Madeleine Albright, the first United States female Secretary of State, will speak about her new book, "Fascism: A Warning"--in conversation with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and UC Santa Cruz alumna Martha Mendoza--on Tuesday, February 5, at the at the Kaiser Permanente Arena in Santa Cruz.</summary><keywords>madeleine albright, martha mendoza, the humanities institute at uc santa cruz</keywords><start-date>1548715500000</start-date><display-name>Madeleine Albright </display-name><path>/2019/01/madeleine-allbright-mendoza</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/01/madeleine-allbright-mendoza</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1548714464778</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1548717316736</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/allbright-250.png</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/allbright-250.png</link><site>news</site><name>allbright-250.png</name><display-name>allbright-250.png</display-name><file-size>104704</file-size><width>250</width><height>327</height></image><image-alt>Madeleine Albright,</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/allbright-thumb.png</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/allbright-thumb.png</link><site>news</site><name>allbright-thumb.png</name><display-name>allbright-thumb.png</display-name><file-size>30271</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Madeleine Albright,</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Madeleine Albright</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/albright-book-cover-225.png</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/albright-book-cover-225.png</link><site>news</site><name>albright-book-cover-225.png</name><display-name>albright-book-cover-225.png</display-name><file-size>148028</file-size><width>225</width><height>351</height></image><image-alt>maedleien albright book cover</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Madeleine Albright, the first United States female Secretary of State, will speak about her new book, <em>Fascism: A Warning</em>--in conversation with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and UC Santa Cruz alumna Martha Mendoza--on Tuesday, February 5, at the Kaiser Permanente Arena in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The book is a personal examination of fascism in the recent past and how its legacy shapes today's world. It shows how fascism has not only endured through the 20th century, but now presents a more dangerous threat to peace and justice than at any other time since the end of World War II.</p>
<p>Albright served as America's 64th Secretary of State from 1997 to 2001, and her career also includes additional positions at the White House, on Capitol Hill, and as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
<p>Her previous books include the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Madam Secretary</em>, <em>The Mighty and the Almighty</em>, <em>Memo to the President</em>, and <em>Read My Pins</em>.</p>
<p>This event is presented by Bookshop Santa and is co-sponsored by <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/#home"><strong><em>The Humanities Institute</em></strong></a> at UC Santa Cruz (THI).</p>
<p>"At The Humanities Institute, we are committed to engaging with anyone interested in compelling ideas and making sense of this increasingly complex world, noted THI director Irena Polic. &#8220;We are thrilled to be partnering with Bookshop Santa Cruz on bringing Madeleine Albright to our community."</p>
<p>"Bookshop owner Casey and I started working together years ago believing that together we really are stronger,&#8221; said Polic. &#8220;Our partnership allows us to leverage our networks and resources to bring speakers to our town that neither one of us would be able to attract on our own."</p>
<p>"It is especially wonderful that we were able to get Martha Mendoza, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and a UC Santa Cruz alumna, to be in conversation with Ms. Albright,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I am very much looking forward to their conversation on February 5th."</p>
<p>Tickets are $23 and include one general admission ticket to the event, plus a pre-signed paperback copy of <em>Fascism: A Warning</em>. All books will be distributed at the venue.</p>

<p>For decades, the U.S. Navy has used high-powered sonar during anti-submarine training and testing exercises in various ocean habitats, including the San Nicolas Basin off Southern California. Beaked whales are particularly sensitive to these kinds of military sonars, which sometimes result in mass stranding events. Following legal action from environmental activists related to these risks, the Navy modified some training activities, created &#8220;sonar-free&#8221; areas, and spent more than a decade and tens of millions of dollars trying to find ways to reduce the harm to beaked whales and other mammals.</p>
<p>The new research, led by Brandon Southall at UC Santa Cruz and Kelly Benoit-Bird at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, aimed to better understand why whales keep returning to the test range despite the risks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings, based on a novel integration of active sonar imaging and passive listening technologies, have multiple management implications,&#8221; explained Southall. &#8220;They provide direct information to the Navy and federal regulators to better manage important and impacted habitat areas off California. And they give us new data on foraging ecology for population-level models of disturbance that have been at the heart of recent debate and litigation over spatial management and proposed sonar exclusion zones.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers equipped an underwater robot with echosounders to measure the abundance, density, and sizes of deep-sea squids in different parts of the Navy test range, as well as in nearby waters. They also developed an &#8220;energy budget&#8221; for beaked whales, showcasing the costs&#8212;in time and calories&#8212;of hunting for squid. This helped the researchers estimate how many dives the whales needed to make in order to get enough food to survive in different areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beaked whales work very hard to obtain their food. They are essentially living paycheck to paycheck,&#8221; said Benoit-Bird. Unlike many baleen whales with significant energy reserves, beaked whales can&#8217;t afford to expend too much energy on a dive that doesn&#8217;t result in capturing many squid. In areas where the concentration of prey is low, the beaked whales must work harder and expend more calories&#8212;making reproduction and raising young that much more challenging. Some of the areas under study were so poor in terms of prey that whales likely could not meet their basic energetic requirements if they only fed there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite how things might look from the surface, the deep sea is not uniform,&#8221; Benoit-Bird added. &#8220;There are pockets of wealth where squid are abundant, and beaked whales know exactly how to find those hot spots.&#8221; It turns out that a portion of the Navy test range off Southern California encompasses one of these hot spots&#8212;an area rich in squid.</p>
<p>In fact, squid were 10 times more abundant higher in the area preferred by the whales. In this preferred area, the whales could get enough food by making just one dive a day. In a nearby sonar-free area (established with the idea that beaked whales could shelter in these areas while the sonar tests were under way) the whales would need to make between 22 and 100 dives per day to get enough food&#8212;something that would be difficult or impossible to do.</p>
<p>This study is the first to link habitat quality with beaked whale behavior in such fine spatial scales. It also demonstrates that scientists can&#8217;t assess the quality of deep-sea habitats by simply making measurements at the ocean surface, or even by measuring the physical and chemical properties of the deep ocean. Direct measurements of the prey environment at the depths where animals are feeding, coupled with observations of when and where animals are foraging, are critical.</p>
<p>Until now, collecting such detailed data, even over small time and space scales, was virtually impossible. The researchers are now working on tools that will help them study predators and prey over longer time periods, and in other areas where the Navy operates high-powered sonar. Similar field-research and modeling techniques could also be used to assess the potential impacts of other human activities that may disturb ocean animals, such as shipping traffic or offshore oil and gas development.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9aba03ff807270171e737f60b5280625"><name>fall-applications</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz builds strong transfer, frosh applicant pool</title><summary>The campus marked the first step toward building the Classes of 2021 (transfer) and 2023 (first-time), receiving 67,262 applications for fall 2019 enrollment. </summary><start-date>1548748800000</start-date><display-name>UC applications</display-name><path>/2019/01/fall-applications</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/01/fall-applications</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1548784107675</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1549477396112</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/applications-bridge-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/applications-bridge-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>applications-bridge-400px.jpg</name><display-name>applications-bridge-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>204548</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>Students crossing bridge</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/applications-bridge-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/applications-bridge-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>applications-bridge-80px.jpg</name><display-name>applications-bridge-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>17814</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Students crossing bridge</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>In 2018&#8211;19, UC Santa Cruz fulfilled a state requirement to enroll one California transfer student for every two first-year students from the state.

<p>The UC Santa Cruz admissions team doesn&#8217;t just recruit students&#8212;they help create the campus&#8217;s next generation of alumni.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we develop our recruitment plans and work with our faculty senate committee on admissions and financial aid to finalize our admission policies, the focus of our conversations is all about enrolling students representing excellence and diversity who will become our future alumni,&#8221; said Michelle Whittingham, the associate vice chancellor for Enrollment Management.</p>
<p>The campus marked the first step toward building the Classes of 2021 (transfer) and 2023 (first-time), <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/content-analysis/ug-admissions/ug-data.html">receiving 67,262 applications for fall 2019 enrollment</a>.&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus saw nearly the same number of students wanting to transfer from a California community college, continuing the strong outcome built in the past several years.</span></p>
<p>The admissions team is now reviewing applications&#8212;evaluating students&#8217; academic achievements and preparation in light of the opportunities available to them and their demonstrated capacity to contribute to the vitality and intellectual life on-campus. Undergraduate applicants will be notified of admission decisions and waitlist invitations beginning mid-February, with the majority beginning mid-March. Admitted first-year students have until May 1 to indicate their intent to enroll and transfers have until June 1.</p>
<p>In 2018&#8211;19, UC Santa Cruz fulfilled a state requirement to enroll one California transfer student for every two first-year students from the state. The campus&#8217;s exceptional efforts to attract transfer students led to a transfer pool with 10,138 California students, a 15 percent increase from 2017, yet similar to 2018. In total, the campus received 11,729 transfer applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s exciting to see the strong pool again of transfer applications,&#8221; said Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education Richard Hughey. &#8220;Our admissions office has been working up and down the state, with students and community college advisors, to ensure potential transfer students to are aware of the welcoming opportunities and distinct learning environment available at UC Santa Cruz through its majors, colleges, research opportunities, and student programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz received applications from 55,533 students seeking to be new first-year students for fall 2019, a 1.3 percent decrease from the previous year. Within that, the campus received 44,354 applications from California residents, a 3.3 percent decrease from last year, partially due to the expected decrease in California high school grads from 2018 to 2019.</p>
<p>California high school graduates are projected to decline from 435,000 in 2018 to 431,000 in 2019, according to the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE).</p>
<p>The campus&#8217;s blend of high-impact research with tight-knit communities of learning&#8212;the 10 residential colleges&#8212;continues to be attractive for students from other states and countries.</p>
<p>Freshman applications from international students increased by 12.5 percent, and domestic out-of-state applications slightly declined. Transfer applications from international students increased by 6.8 percent and domestic out of state increased by 4 percent.</p>
<p>The campus also continued to see interest from ethnically diverse California students with this year&#8217;s figures in line with last year&#8217;s. Of California freshman applicants, 5 percent are African American; 32 are Asian American; 36 percent are Chicano/Latino; 0.5 percent are American Indian and 24 percent are White. Of the California community college applicants who are not international, 6 percent are African American; 27 are Asian American; 0.7 are American Indian; 32 percent are Chicano/Latino; and 31 percent are White.</p>
<p>U.S. News and World Report ranked UC Santa Cruz at No. 26 in a list of best universities for undergraduate teaching. The magazine also put the campus among the top 30 public universities in the nation.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students who arrive in the fall will be part of the campus&#8217;s residential college communities for living and learning, as well as host of special programs, including the Scholars Program, Smith Society, and ever expanding opportunities for undergraduate research, internships, and creative projects with world-class faculty.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9bf0b046807270171e737f608a5cf37f"><name>paul-skenazy-fiction-debut-feature</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>An unburied dream</title><summary>It took professor emeritus Paul Skenazy many years to say, "I want to be a fiction writer."

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Skenazy&#8217;s fiction-writing dream began in his youth, but he buried it. &#8220;It took me years to say, &#8216;I want to be a fiction writer, that is what I am going to do,&#8217;&#8221; &#160;said Skenazy, a UC Santa Cruz emeritus professor of literature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years ago, Skenazy retired from UC Santa Cruz and unearthed that old dream. Now, that decision is starting to pay off in ways that Skenazy can only describe as &#8220;shocking.&#8221; &#160;Last year, Skenazy&#8217;s debut novella</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Temper CA, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">beat out 200 other contenders to win the prestigious Miami University Press Novella Prize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This honor puts Skenazy in rarified company; previous honorees include Garth Greenwell, a celebrated fiction writer and literary critic whose debut book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Belongs to You</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was hailed as the &#8220;first great novel of 2016&#8221; by Publishers Weekly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blessings kept coming. Miami University Press, which only releases two books a year, published </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temper&#160;CA</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the winter of 2018. The book tells the story of a woman who returns to her hometown in California&#8217;s Gold Country to attend her grandfather&#8217;s funeral. During this visit, she has a reckoning with her childhood myths and California&#8217;s violent past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Skenazy drew a capacity crowd to Bookshop Santa Cruz for his reading from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temper&#160;CA,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> followed with a Q &amp; A with bestselling author and fellow Santa Cruzan Jonathan Franzen, who praised Skenazy for &#8220;the gift of creating characters who are sympathetic not in spite of their prickliness but because of it, and of depicting human bonds that are all the tenser for being so strong.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That reading felt like &#8220;a coming out party,&#8221; Skenazy said. &#8220;It was amazing. It was really one of the great nights of my life. I just felt like I had gotten a bunch of gifts from the heavens.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many former students &#160;were out in the crowd, including the fiction writer, essayist, and playwright Kathy Chetkovich (Porter &#8216;80, literature), who is grateful for his years of mentorship at UC Santa Cruz. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One thing I loved about Paul&#8217;s literature classes was the way we were encouraged to do the kind of close reading that doesn&#8217;t reduce a book by explaining it but instead enlarges it by opening it up, asking it questions, releasing its power,&#8221; said Chetkovich. &#8216;&#8220;He showed us how something exciting could happen between book and reader. Now it&#8217;s forty years later, and he&#8217;s turned that same enlivening instinct and love for story, character, and voice to a novel of his own.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>The long and twisty road to publication</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his jacket blurb for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temper&#160;CA, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Franzen noted that Skenazy&#8217;s fiction &#8220;misbehaves. It swerves, it revisits ground and digs deeper, it confounds expectations.&#8221; The same words could be used to describe Skenazy&#8217;s long, swerving, confounding, and sometimes tortuous journey toward publication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many years, Skenazy did not have the time to focus on his fiction writing ambitions. After attending the University of Chicago and Stanford, he taught contemporary U.S. fiction to UC Santa Cruz students for 30 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He led a rich, full life, with three children, a successful marriage, and a job he loved. He wrote several published books, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversations With Maxine Hong Kingston&#160;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and scholarly works about James M. Cain and Dashiell Hammett. But his schedule and his side interests, including a mystery novel-reviewing gig for the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post,&#160;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">crowded out his writing life. The most he could do was craft humorous poems and stories for friends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His time and mental space opened up at last when he retired from UC Santa Cruz in 2005. But the writing life was never easy, even when he had time to spare. Sharing an early draft with other writers was painful for him. For a while, it shattered his confidence. &#8220;I was devastated that good writers didn&#8217;t think much of it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean, they thought it needed work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His next 13 years were full of drafts and revisions. This included &#8220;a frustrating year trying to please an agent with a very different vision of what the novel should be,&#8221; Skenazy recalled. </span></p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Suddenly, you&#8217;re there&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is the point in the story where most writers would just give up and scrap the project. But Skenazy could not stop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People talk to me about my perseverance,&#8217;&#8217; he said. &#8220;I think of myself as a dabbler. I play some ukulele. I do some art. I was interested in photography for a while, and moved on to having a dog.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, he now sees that perseverance is also a part of his personality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I dig in,&#8217;&#8217; he said. &#8220;One thing I talked about, constantly, as a teacher, was &#8216;chewing on the bone.&#8217; You&#8217;ve got to keep chewing to get to the marrow.&#8217;&#8217; This applied to the students&#8217; creative work as well as their close reading skills. &#8220;Slow down, look at the paragraph,&#8217;&#8217; he said. &#8220;It is going to matter. You are going to find more in it than you think, and once you do, everything will open up. That is what happened to me. I was willing to listen to people near me, who said, &#8216;You can do more.&#8217; Then you get lucky.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Santa Cruz-based author Thad Nodine, (Ph.D. &#8216;90, literature), a friend of Skenazy&#8217;s, remembers him as an &#8220;honest, kind, insightful, and incredibly well-read&#8221; thesis advisor at UC Santa Cruz. These days, Nodine is relishing his mentor&#8217;s publishing success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skenazy&#8217;s experience in getting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temper&#160;CA</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published should bring hope to all writers, Nodine said. It just goes to show that writers who are serious about publication must rewrite stories, re-imagine characters, and streamline plots, Nodine said. &#8220;But in the meantime, keep submitting your work again and again. It&#8217;s been an inspiration to watch Paul meddle with his characters and their lives in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temper&#160;CA.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He pushed some into the background and brought others forward as he found new storylines. But through it all he found his own way to the book he wanted to write.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the swirl about <em>Temper CA</em> subsides, Skenazy hopes to return to other fiction projects. Meanwhile, he&#8217;s savoring the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You work on something that is pretty abstract for a long time,&#8217;&#8217; he said. &#8220;Then suddenly, those years turn into something. It is this affirmation that you&#8217;re alive, that it&#8217;s worth taking time on something that takes forever, that never seems to bear fruit, and seems to be part of some silly dream you&#8217;ve always had. And, suddenly, you&#8217;re there.&#8221; </span></p>

In the Fresno incident, all three people involved believed they were using cocaine, which later was determined to be &#8220;100 percent fentanyl&#8221; according to the deputy chief of the city&#8217;s police department. &#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>"It will make people stop breathing or have very diminished breathing," said Dr. Patil Armenian, a UCSF-Fresno emergency physician and medical toxicologist who treated the Jan. 7 victims. "It is so potent, the concern is that even with one exposure it could be enough to make someone stop breathing and die."</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>We have seen similar headlines in Santa Cruz prompting the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency to issue a warning about the rise and danger of <a href="http://www.santacruzhealth.org/Portals/7/Pdfs/Alerts/Fentanyl%20Patient%20Bulletin%205.3.16.pdf">fentanyl</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>What is fentanyl?</p>
<p>Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid painkiller that&#8217;s 100 times more powerful than morphine. It's intended as a "last resort" for cancer patients with a high tolerance for pain killers. Because it's synthetic (made in a lab) and typically cheaper, it's seen as more lucrative for drug dealers, who often add it to heroin, cocaine, or other drugs (including pills) to increase their profit.</p>
<p><br/>The real risk with fentanyl isn&#8217;t people seeking it out, rather it&#8217;s receiving it unknowingly in doses of cocaine, heroin or altered pills. A rise in the presence of fentanyl in California will undoubtedly contribute to a rise in the number of overdoses and deaths, just as we are seeing in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>What are the dangers?</p>
<p>People at highest risk of overdose and fatality are those who unknowingly take fentanyl. Though similar in effects to other opioids, fentanyl&#8217;s extremely high potency makes it the most commonly used drug involved in overdoses, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p><br/>Signs of an overdose:</p>
<p>Knowing the signs of an opioid overdose can save a life. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Loss of consciousness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slow, shallow breathing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choking or gurgling sounds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limp body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pale, blue or cold skin</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>What to do if you think someone is overdosing: &#160;DO NOT DELAY CALLING 911</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Call 911 immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administer Naloxone if available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay with the person needing assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lay the person on their side to prevent choking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu/alcohol-other-drugs/overdose-prevention/making-the-call.html">Call 911 without hesitation if you suspect someone is experiencing alcohol poisoning or a drug overdose.</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<br/>
<p>More on naloxone:</p>
<p>All sworn members of UC Santa Cruz Police Department are equipped with and trained to administer naloxone. Naloxone is a medication that counters the effects of opioid overdose, allowing the person to breathe normally until medical professionals arrive. Naloxone kits are available to students at the UC Santa Cruz Pharmacy.</p>
<p><br/>Responsible Action Plan:</p>
<p>Due to UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/responsible-action.html">Responsible Action Plan</a> (Medical Amnesty Policy) if medical assistance is sought, a conduct record for violations of the University&#8217;s Alcohol and Drugs policies will not be created for the intoxicated student or the student(s) actively seeking medical assistance so long as all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The student requests OR another person contacts a University Official (e.g., Resident Assistant (RA), Community Safety Officer (CSO), police officer, etc.) for medical assistance on behalf of a student experiencing an alcohol or controlled substance medical-related emergency, stays with the individual requiring aid, follows the requests of medical staff, meets with the appropriate University Officials, and cooperates with any University investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No other Code of Student Conduct violations were committed by the students involved during the same incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student(s) has not received amnesty under this Plan more than twice in two calendar years starting from the date of the initial incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither the UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (<a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/student-handbook/appendices.html">Appendix G</a>) Immunity clause or the UC Santa Cruz Anti-Hazing Policy already apply.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Even worse, because cruising is less costly at lower speeds, self-driving cars will slow to a crawl as they "kill time," says transportation planner Adam Millard-Ball, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Parking prices are what get people out of their cars and on to public transit, but autonomous vehicles have no need to park at all. They can get around paying for parking by cruising," he said. "They will have every incentive to create havoc."</p>
<p>Millard-Ball analyzes "<a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1YSii,L-HRUJ64">The Autonomous Vehicle Parking Problem</a>" in the current issue of <em>Transport Policy</em>.</p>
<p>That scenario of robot-fueled gridlock is right around the corner, according to Millard-Ball, who says autonomous, or self-driving, vehicles are likely to become commonplace in the next five to 20 years. Millard-Ball is the first researcher to analyze the combined impact of parking costs and self-driving cars on city centers, where the cost and availability of parking is the only tool that effectively restricts car travel.</p>
<p>Under the best-case scenario, the presence of as few as 2,000 self-driving cars in downtown San Francisco will slow traffic to less than 2 miles per hour, according to Millard-Ball, who uses game theory and a traffic micro-simulation model to generate his predictions.</p>
<p>"It just takes a minority to gum things up," he said, recalling the congestion caused at airports by motorists cruising the "arrivals" area to avoid paying for parking: "Drivers would go as slowly as possibly so they wouldn't have to drive around again." Free cell-phone parking areas, coupled with strict enforcement in loading areas, relieved the airport snarls, but cities will be hard-pressed to provide remote parking areas for self-driving cars at rates lower than the cost of cruising&#8212;which Millard-Ball estimates at 50 cents per hour.</p>
<p>"Even when you factor in electricity, depreciation, wear and tear, and maintenance, cruising costs about 50 cents an hour&#8212;that's cheaper than parking even in a small town," says Millard-Ball. "Unless it's free or cheaper than cruising, why would anyone use a remote lot?"</p>
<p>Regulation also falls short because, as Millard-Ball puts it, "It's difficult to regulate intent. You can pass a law saying it's illegal to drive more than 10 minutes without a passenger, but what if the car is picking up a parcel?"</p>
<p>The solution: congestion pricing, which can take different forms but essentially amounts to a user fee. In London, motorists pay a flat fee of &#163;11.50 (about $15) to enter the city center. Singapore and Stockholm employ similar models. More sophisticated models could charge by miles driven, or assign different fees to particular streets.</p>
<p>Economists and environmentalists agree that congestion pricing effectively reduces congestion and pollution, but it's a politically fraught strategy because it raises the ire of commuters. Which is where Millard-Ball sees opportunity.</p>
<p>"As a policy, congestion pricing is difficult to implement. The public never wants to pay for something they've historically gotten for free," he said. "But no one owns an autonomous vehicle now, so there's no constituency organized to oppose charging for the use of public streets. This is the time to establish the principle and use it to avoid the nightmarish scenario of total gridlock."</p>
<p>Moreover, he noted, self-driving cars could be outfitted with devices that would give policymakers options for levying fees based on location, speed, time of day&#8212;even which lane the vehicle occupies.</p>
<p>"The fees could raise money for cities to improve transportation," he said. "The idea is to do it now before autonomous vehicles become widespread."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a1b933c1807270171e737f60d61ada2f"><name>uc-free-speech-board</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Jody Greene and Mary Beth Pudup named to inaugural board of UC National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz professors Jody Greene and Mary Beth Pudup are among 19 leading University of California scholars who have been named to the inaugural academic advisory board of the UC National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz news, ucsc news, free speech</keywords><start-date>1548902700000</start-date><display-name> UC free speech advisory board</display-name><path>/2019/01/uc-free-speech-board</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/01/uc-free-speech-board</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1548901494902</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1548903511675</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/jody-greene-2751.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/jody-greene-2751.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jody-greene-2751.jpg</name><display-name>jody-greene-275.jpg</display-name><file-size>73243</file-size><width>275</width><height>227</height></image><image-alt>Jody Greene </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/free-speech-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/free-speech-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>free-speech-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>free-speech-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22009</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jody Greene </image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jody Greene</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/01/images/pudup-mary-beth-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/01/images/pudup-mary-beth-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pudup-mary-beth-200.jpg</name><display-name>pudup-mary-beth-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>57630</file-size><width>200</width><height>261</height></image><image-alt>Mary Beth Pudup </image-alt><image-caption>Mary Beth Pudup</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz professors Jody Greene and Mary Beth Pudup are among 19 leading University of California scholars in a variety of fields--ranging from religious studies and law to medicine and philosophy&#8212;who have been named to the inaugural academic advisory board of the<em> <strong><a href="https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/">UC National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement</a>.</strong></em></p>

<p>The University of California--birthplace of the Free Speech Movement--launched the National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement in 2017 to support and advance research, education and advocacy on these challenging issues.</p>
<p>Last year, the center announced its first set of <em><strong><a href="https://news.uci.edu/2018/02/08/ucs-national-center-for-free-speech-and-civic-engagement-selects-inaugural-class-of-fellows-expands-board/">fellows</a>.</strong></em> These 10 scholars, students, and analysts from across the country are researching timely, vital First Amendment topics. As part of the fellowship, each spent a week in residence at one of the 10 UC campuses to engage with students, faculty, administrators and community members.</p>
<p>The center&#8217;s first national conference, <a href="https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/speech-matters/"><em><strong>#SpeechMatters: The Future of Free Expression on Campus</strong></em></a>, will be held March 21 at the UCDC offices in Washington, D.C.

Starting in 2014, they collected measurements of water chemistry and biological indicators in the area so they could compare conditions before and after the plant began discharging brine into the ocean.</p>
<p>The results of their study, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/11/2/208">published January 25 in <em>Water</em></a>, include good news and bad news. The good news is that they found no significant changes in the organisms living on the seafloor and other biological indicators. The researchers attributed this to the long history of industrial activities in the area, including cooling water discharge from a power plant adjacent to the desalination plant, which had already perturbed the natural setting.</p>
<p>The bad news in the study is that the salinity level in the discharge zone exceeded the permitted level, and the salinity plume extended much farther offshore than permitted under the California Ocean Plan. Senior author Adina Paytan, a research professor in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz, said the study provides valuable information for planners considering where to locate future desalination plants and what discharge technologies to use.</p>
<p>"Desalination is one solution for addressing our water needs in densely populated coastal areas. It can work if done right, and our study highlights some areas where planning and monitoring can be improved," Paytan said.</p>
<p>She noted that all the right steps were taken during the 14 years of planning for the Carlsbad Desalination Plant, including modeling of the discharge system to ensure that the brine would be effectively diluted as it mixed with ocean water. "They did what they were supposed to do, and the fact that it still wasn't sufficient means that somehow the models being used are not good enough," Paytan said.</p>
<p>Technologies are available that could reduce the impact of the brine on salinity levels at the site, she said. Currently the plant mixes the brine with cooling water from the power plant before discharging it through a channel extending about 50 meters offshore.</p>
<p>"The combined discharge is a good approach, but they might need to dilute it more," Paytan said. "They could also use a diffusor system, which is basically a pipe with lots of small holes in it that spreads out the discharge over a larger area so the mixing potential is higher."</p>
<p>The study also suggests that desalination plants should be located away from areas where there are sensitive habitats or intact coastal ecosystems that might be disrupted by the brine discharge. "If you want less impact, you might as well do it where the natural environment has already been impacted by previous and ongoing human activities," Paytan said.</p>
