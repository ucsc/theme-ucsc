Aaron Hung Ye served at UCSC as a cook for Dining Services working at the Cowell Dining Hall. Aaron was born on September 21, 1959 in Shanghai China and moved to America in 1981. For over thirty years, he worked as a chef in several local restaurants as well a restaurant owner himself. Aaron joined our team in September 2017. His family shared with us that Aaron really enjoyed working at UCSC. &#8220;He would come home from work and tell us what he made for the day and how much students like his food. &#8230; He was so happy,&#8221; said his son Philip.</p>
<p>Aaron&#8217;s infectious smile clearly made an impact on all of us in Dining in short period he worked for us. The family came to campus to express their thanks to UCSC Dining and especially to the staff of Cowell Dining to tell them personally how they affected Aaron&#8217;s life so positively.</p>
<p>Notification of Aaron&#8217;s passing came from his wife Sandy. Aaron is survived by Sandy, their daughter, Madelin, and son, Philip.</p>
<p>Dining Services and the greater UCSC Community mourn his passing.</p>
<p>Sad and shocking news can be difficult to process. We encourage staff who wish to speak with someone to call the Employee Assistance Program at (866) 808-6205<br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Bill Prime, Director, Dining Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c82cde8a80727017605850f740d6dc99"><name>grad-feature-aboytes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Computer engineering graduate student focused on intersection of energy, computer security</title><summary>For Allen Aboytes, one of the best things about working in the field of computer engineering is the cooperation with others to achieve a goal.</summary><start-date>1575273600000</start-date><display-name>Graduate focus</display-name><path>/2019/12/grad-feature-aboytes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/12/grad-feature-aboytes</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1575316414061</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1575316768636</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/12/images/allen-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/12/images/allen-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>allen-400px.jpg</name><display-name>allen-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>122044</file-size><width>400</width><height>533</height></image><image-alt>Allen Aboytes</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/12/images/allen-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/12/images/allen-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>allen-80px.jpg</name><display-name>allen-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>11185</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Allen Aboytes</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Aboytes said he wants to work as a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore once he earns his doctoral degree.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>This article is one in a series of stories that spotlight incoming graduate students and the obstacles they&#8217;ve overcome to pursue an advanced degree.</em></p>
<p>For Allen Aboytes, one of the best things about working in the field of computer engineering is the cooperation with others to achieve a goal.</p>
<p>He also loves the freedom. &#8220;There is a lot of freedom of thought when you&#8217;re designing something for the computer,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old, who grew up in Exeter near Visalia, got his bachelor&#8217;s degree in computer engineering from UC Santa Cruz and is staying to pursue his PhD to further his interest in the intersection of energy consumption and computer security. He hopes to do research that will help making large computing systems more energy efficient and secure.</p>
<p>He was very curious at a young age about how computers worked. As he got older and understood them, he grew to love the environment of working on projects and programming.</p>
<p>Though his parents didn&#8217;t attend college, Aboytes always knew he wanted to get a university education.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt my high school education didn&#8217;t expose me enough to things that interested me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It was challenging to navigate the application process because no one in his family knew how to give him advice. His high school counselors helped but he didn&#8217;t really know what he was getting into and how rigorous and fast-paced his undergraduate classes would be.</p>
<p>The key step to him considering graduate school was his involvement in the STEM Diversity Programs, which helps connect students to research programs nationwide. He appreciated being accepted with UC Leads, a program designed to prepare promising students for advanced education in science, technology, engineering and math. According to its website, the program is for &#8220;students who have experienced situations or conditions that have adversely impacted their advancement in their field of study.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was applying to grad school, it was much easier,&#8221; Aboytes said. &#8220;I had a network of support through STEM Diversity and my research mentors throughout the summers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is glad to stay at Santa Cruz where he has made many good friends. When he is not studying, he enjoys visiting the beach, soccer and taking relaxing walks.</p>
<p>After earning his doctoral degree, Aboytes would love to work as a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c86961ac80727017605850f79046ed27"><name>tedx-santacruz</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nine UCSC speakers join TEDx Santa Cruz extravaganza Dec. 7</title><summary>Nine UCSC affiliates will join novelist Jonathan Franzen and a host of other speakers for TEDx Santa Cruz, a daylong extravaganza focused this year on the "Art of Hope," on Saturday, Dec. 7.&#13;

<p>The NAI Fellows Program highlights academic inventors who have demonstrated a spirit of innovation in creating or facilitating outstanding inventions that have made a tangible impact on quality of life, economic development, and the welfare of society. Election to NAI Fellow is the highest professional distinction accorded solely to academic inventors.</p>
<p>Schmidt&#8217;s inventions include novel optical sensing technologies with applications in biomedical diagnostics. He and his collaborators developed hollow-core optical waveguides that can be integrated into chips using standard silicon fabrication technology, enabling light propagation through tiny volumes of liquids on a chip. Diagnostic instruments based on these "optofluidic chips" offer the potential for a rapid, low-cost, and portable option for identifying molecular biomarkers and other disease-related bioparticles such as whole viruses.</p>
<p>Schmidt holds the Narinder Kapany Chair in Optoelectronics and directs the W. M. Keck Nanofabrication Facility at UC Santa Cruz. He also serves as associate dean for research in the Baskin School of Engineering. His research covers a broad range in photonics and integrated optics, including optofluidic devices, atom photonics, nano-magneto-optics, and spintronic devices.</p>
<p>A fellow of the IEEE and the Optical Society of America, Schmidt received the Engineering Achievement Award from the IEEE Photonics Society earlier this year.</p>
<p>The 2019 class of NAI fellows, representing 136 research universities and governmental and non-profit research institutes worldwide, collectively holds over 3,500 issued U.S. patents. The new fellows will be formally inducted in a ceremony at the annual meeting of the NAI in Phoenix, Arizona, in April 2020. The complete list of NAI Fellows is available on the <a href="https://academyofinventors.org">NAI website</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c8e4fc2180727017605850f70c754114"><name>water-system-flush</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Crews to flush campus water system from Dec. 23 to Jan. 2</title><summary>From Dec. 23 to Jan. 2, campus crews will be flushing the campus water system.</summary><start-date>1575273600000</start-date><display-name>Water system</display-name><path>/2019/12/water-system-flush</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/12/water-system-flush</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1575328480263</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1575328480263</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UCSC Physical Plant is responsible for maintenance of all our water mains on campus.

<p>This program is a vital part of maintaining water quality standards that are mandated by the state of California.&#160;The health and welfare of all on campus is a part of the mission statement of the Physical Plant and hydrant&#160;flushing&#160;helps fulfill that mission.&#160;Water main flushing also assures availability of water at the appropriate pressures in emergencies.</p>
<p>The&#160;flushing&#160;requires a high flow of water for short periods of time and is done at key fire hydrant locations around campus.</p>
<p>Our crews do everything they can to minimize impact to the roads and landscape during these brief, high flow periods. Thank you&#160;for your patience and understanding while this process is occurring.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Physical Plant</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c9241e7680727017605850f7b3deed36"><name>cruzhacks</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CruzHacks 2020 to be held at Stevenson Event Center January 17 to 19</title><summary>CruzHacks 2020, the annual student-run hackathon at UC Santa Cruz, will be held at the Stevenson Event Center from January 17 to 19. </summary><start-date>1575273600000</start-date><display-name>CruzHacks 2020 to be held at Stevenson Event Center January 17 to 19</display-name><path>/2019/12/cruzhacks</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/12/cruzhacks</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1575332617818</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1575332743540</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs Office</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioweb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/12/images/cruzhacks-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/12/images/cruzhacks-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cruzhacks-400.jpg</name><display-name>cruzhacks-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>58536</file-size><width>400</width><height>329</height></image><image-alt>CruzHacks logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/12/images/cruzhacks-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/12/images/cruzhacks-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cruzhacks-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cruzhacks-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20731</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>CruzHacks logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Applications now open for hackers, mentors, judges, and volunteers</article-subhead><article-text><p><a href="https://www.cruzhacks.com/">CruzHacks 2020</a>, the annual student-run hackathon at UC Santa Cruz, will be held at the Stevenson Event Center from January 17 to 19.</p>
<p>With a new slate of student leaders at the helm, CruzHacks aims to bring together 600 hackers of all backgrounds for a weekend of innovation. The non-profit hackathon strives to create an environment in which high school and college students can work collaboratively to harness their talents and make their visions for social change a reality. While most hackathons cater to a narrowly focused tech community, CruzHacks endeavors to create engagement and value for Santa Cruz as a whole.</p>
<p>Applications are now open for hackers, mentors, judges, and volunteers. Visit <a href="https://www.cruzhacks.com/">cruzhacks.com</a> for information and to apply. Applications will close on December 10th, 2019.</p>
<p>The hacker application requires a student to fill out personal information as well as a questionnaire to gauge if their values align with the hackathon&#8217;s mission. The organizers note that creating a hackathon for all requires everyone involved to be committed to a vision of inclusion.</p>
<p>Faculty members are encouraged to apply as mentors and judges. The participation of faculty members helps to engage the UCSC community and offers hackers access to a vast reserve of expertise and teaching ability. Mentor and judge positions are not limited to faculty members, however. Those with knowledge and passion for helping others in a hackathon setting are always needed.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ccdf2e6280727017605850f7ff806c64"><name>exoplanet-composition</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Composition of gas giant planets not determined by host star, study finds</title><summary>Research led by astronomers at UC Santa Cruz and Carnegie Institution for Science has implications for understanding how planets form.</summary><keywords>Jonathan Fortney</keywords><start-date>1575360000000</start-date><display-name>Composition of gas giant planets not determined by host star, study finds</display-name><path>/2019/12/exoplanet-composition</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/12/exoplanet-composition</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1575395208774</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1575395389768</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Natasha Metzler, Carnegie</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/12/images/planetary-disk-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/12/images/planetary-disk-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>planetary-disk-410.jpg</name><display-name>planetary-disk-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>50811</file-size><width>410</width><height>230</height></image><image-alt>planetary disk</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/12/images/planetary-disk-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/12/images/planetary-disk-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>planetary-disk-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>planetary-disk-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>13646</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>planetary disk</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>An artist&#8217;s conception of a young star surrounded by a primordial rotating disk of gas and dust from which planets can form.

The new findings, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab4f79">published in the <em>Astronomical Journal</em></a>, have important implications for understanding the planetary formation process.</p>
<p>In their youths, stars are surrounded by a rotating disk of gas and dust from which planets are born. Astronomers have long wondered how much a star&#8217;s makeup determines the raw material from which planets are constructed&#8212;a question that is easier to probe now that we know the galaxy is teeming with exoplanets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understanding the relationship between the chemical composition of a star and its planets could help shed light on the planetary formation process,&#8221; explained first author Johanna Teske of the Carnegie Institution for Science.</p>
<p>For example, previous research indicated that the occurrence of gas giant planets increases around stars with a higher concentration of heavy elements, those elements other than hydrogen and helium. This is thought to provide evidence for one of the primary competing theories for how planets form, which proposes that gas giant planets are built from the slow accretion of disk material until a core about 10 times Earth&#8217;s mass is formed. At this point, the solid baby planetary interior is able to surround itself with helium and hydrogen gas, birthing a mature giant planet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Previous work looked at the relationship between the presence of planets and how much iron exists in the host star, but we wanted to expand that to include the heavy element content of the planets themselves, and to look at more than just iron,&#8221; explained co-author Daniel Thorngren, who completed much of the work as a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz and is now a Trottier Postdoctoral Fellow at the Universit&#233; de Montr&#233;al.</p>
<p>Teske, Thorngren and their colleagues&#8212;Jonathan Fortney of UC Santa Cruz, Natalie Hinkel of the Southwest Research Institute, and John Brewer of San Francisco State University&#8212;compared the bulk heavy element content of 24 cool, gas giant planets to the abundances of &#8220;planet forming elements&#8221; carbon, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, iron, and nickel in their 19 host stars (some stars host multiple planets).</p>
<p>They were surprised to find that there was no correlation between the amount of heavy elements in these giant planets and the amount of these planet forming elements in their host stars. So how can astronomers explain the established trend that stars rich in heavy elements are more likely to host gas giant planets?</p>
<p>&#8220;Unraveling this discrepancy could reveal new details about the planet formation process,&#8221; explained coauthor Fortney. &#8220;For example, what other factors are contributing to a baby planet&#8217;s composition as it forms? Perhaps its location in the disk and how far it is from any neighbors. More work is necessary to answer these crucial questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>One clue may come from the authors&#8217; combined results bundling the heavy elements into groupings that reflect their characteristics. The authors saw a tentative correlation between a planet&#8217;s heavy elements and its host star&#8217;s relative abundance of carbon and oxygen, which are called volatile elements, versus the rest of the elements included in this study, which fall into the group called refractory elements. These terms refer to the elements&#8217; low boiling points (volatility) or their high melting points (in the case of the refractory elements). Volatile elements may represent an ice-rich planetary composition, whereas refractory elements may indicate a rocky composition.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to explore this tentative result further, and hopefully add more information to our understanding of the relationships between star and planetary compositions from upcoming missions like NASA&#8217;s James Webb Space Telescope, which will be able to measure elements in exoplanet atmospheres,&#8221; Teske said.</p>

Exactly how these proteins carry out their crucial functions has not been well understood. Now, however, researchers at UC Santa Cruz have worked out the details of key molecular interactions involved in the selection and processing of antigens by MHC-I proteins.</p>
<p>The new findings, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/12/02/1915562116">published December 3 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, help explain certain puzzling differences among MHC-I proteins, with implications for understanding autoimmune diseases and immune responses to infections and cancer. The results also suggest ways in which MHC-I proteins can be manipulated in the laboratory for use in diagnostic and therapeutic applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our discovery of these fundamental mechanisms enables us to develop technologies with tremendous potential for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes,&#8221; said Nikolaos Sgourakis, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz and corresponding author of the paper.</p>
<p>The role of MHC-I proteins is to enable every cell in the body to display on its surface fragments of all the proteins being produced in that cell, typically about 10,000 different proteins. The protein fragments displayed by MHC-I proteins on the cell surface are scanned by specialized immune cells called cytotoxic T cells, which can recognize foreign proteins from an infection or mutated proteins from a tumor and launch an immune response.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cell has this barcoding system in place so it can show the immune system what&#8217;s going on inside, and the T cells continuously surveil the surfaces of cells to sniff out the barcodes of aberrant proteins,&#8221; Sgourakis explained.</p>
<p>Sgourakis and his team, working in close collaboration with coauthor Erik Procko&#8217;s group at the University of Illinois, focused on the process of &#8220;antigen loading&#8221;&#8212;how the protein barcodes are selected and bound to MHC-I proteins so they can be displayed on the cell surface. Molecular &#8220;chaperones&#8221; play an important role in antigen loading and help determine which protein fragments get displayed. The new paper reveals how the interplay between MHC-I proteins and chaperones shapes the repertoire of displayed antigens.</p>
<p><strong>Thousands of variants</strong></p>
<p>There are thousands of different variants of the human MHC-I proteins, produced by different &#8220;alleles&#8221; of the MHC-I genes. The extreme variability of MHC-I proteins accounts for much of the individual variation in immune responses, including differences in susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, infections, and cancer. Each person has six main MHC-I alleles (three inherited from mom and three from dad), and each allele can display a unique subset of all possible barcodes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our six MHC-I proteins sample a fraction of all the possible barcodes being generated in our cells. The ones they select become the displayed antigen repertoire, which is different for every person,&#8221; Sgourakis said.</p>
<p>Sgourakis&#8217;s team studied four different MHC-I alleles, examining their interactions with molecular chaperones and antigens. One function of the chaperones is to help MHC-I proteins fold into their active shapes and stabilize them to prevent misfolding and aggregation. But only some MHC-I alleles are dependent on chaperones for antigen loading. The new findings explain why that is and reveal important details of the antigen selection process.</p>
<p>The key to understanding these interactions was the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques to reveal dynamic structural changes in the MHC-I proteins. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had static crystal structures of MHC proteins, but we could not figure out why some are chaperone-dependent and others are not,&#8221; Sgourakis said. &#8220;It turns out to be a matter of protein dynamics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers found that if the three-dimensional structure of the MHC-I molecule is rigid, chaperones are not involved in antigen loading. If it has flexibility in the peptide binding groove, however, the chaperone will interact with it and help with the antigen loading process. The chaperone can eject antigens that have low affinity for the binding groove, ensuring that the MHC-I protein binds only high-affinity antigens that can be displayed at the cell surface in the proper conformation to activate a T cell response.</p>
<p>A flexible groove may enable the MHC-I molecule to accommodate a broader range of antigens, Sgourakis said. &#8220;The immune system has to cover all these possible barcodes with a limited number of MHC-I alleles. One way to do that is for the binding groove to adopt different shapes, but that flexibility comes at a price. You need to have a mechanism to stabilize these more flexible proteins&#8212;hence the chaperones,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Sgourakis said his lab can now use chaperones in a high-throughput procedure to create libraries of barcoded MHC-I protein complexes encompassing hundreds of different peptides for use in screening T cells from patients and determining their antigen specificities. This procedure has potential applications in immunotherapy for cancer and other diseases. Sgourakis said his team is actively exploring this direction for cancer immunotherapy development in collaboration with clinical researchers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p>

An increasingly important tool for monitoring these populations involves acoustic sensors deployed in the field to record sounds over long periods of time. But analysis of the resulting recordings to identify and count the calls of different species can be time-consuming, even with computers and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>An alternative approach for acoustic monitoring is to evaluate all of the sounds in an environment as a 'soundscape', using features such as acoustic diversity, complexity, and intensity as indicators of ecosystem health. In a new study, recently <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rec.13038">published in <em>Restoration Ecology</em></a>, researchers used soundscape analysis to evaluate the outcomes of restoration efforts in the Western Aleutian Islands.</p>
<p>"We learned that we can collect sound data at larger scales and understand where the ecosystem is responding to our actions," said first author Abraham Borker, who led the study as a graduate student in the <a href="https://ccal.ucsc.edu/">Conservation Action Lab</a> at UC Santa Cruz. Now an adjunct lecturer in ecology and evolutionary biology, Borker came to UCSC to study seabird conservation and earned his Ph.D. in 2018.</p>
<p>"Seabirds are special because they serve as a link between the ocean and land, transporting nutrients from the sea to land and transforming the islands they breed on," he said.</p>
<p>The new study took advantage of a highly successful campaign to remove invasive species and restore seabird nesting colonies in the Western Aleutian islands as a natural experiment. These remote islands, located in the Northern Pacific Ocean between Russia and Alaska, are important nesting sites for many species of seabirds.</p>
<p><strong>Introduced predators</strong></p>
<p>In the 18th century, fur traders introduced arctic foxes to the islands, and they quickly began devastating seabird populations. Later, rats brought to the islands during World War II added to the plight of nesting seabirds. The islands are now part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which in 1949 began efforts to remove the invasive species and restore healthy seabird colonies.</p>
<p>Today, some of the islands still have invasive predators while others have had them removed for varying amounts of time. One island that was never inhabited by foxes or rats was used as a reference for comparison to restored islands, representing a healthy seabird island. Overall, the varying timelines for the removal of invasive species from each island created a perfect opportunity for Borker to test if soundscapes reflect the recovery of island seabirds.</p>
<p>Traditional acoustic monitoring techniques had already been used to evaluate the recovery of seabirds on these islands. That work, led by Rachel Buxton of Colorado State University (a coauthor of the new study) and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/130/2/331/5149345">published in 2013</a>, involved identifying and counting individual bird calls.</p>
<p>"It's quite a laborious process, even with automated tools," Borker said. Using the recordings from the earlier study, the researchers performed soundscape analyses and compared the results with the previous findings to see if the soundscape approach could assess restoration outcomes at a fraction of the effort.</p>
<p>Borker and his team characterized over 800 hours of recordings from across the islands, using a variety of "eco-acoustic" indexes to quantify features of the recordings indicative of each island's ecological conditions. These indexes enabled the researchers to compare the complexity, richness, and similarities of soundscapes between different environments.</p>
<p>Using mathematical models, they found that compared the soundscape analyses to the results from the 2013 study. They found that of the indexes tested, the acoustic richness index, as well as indexes of acoustic similarity to the reference condition, performed best in indicating seabird recovery on the islands. Their findings suggest that eco-acoustic indexes can provide an initial rapid analysis, identifying coarse differences in the amount of seabird acoustic activity between restored areas and a reference site. Their analysis also identified time since invasive species removal as the chief predictor of seabird acoustic activity, as did the 2013 study.</p>
<p>While promising, Borker said this approach to soundscape monitoring isn't perfect, but can scale in a way that other approaches struggle to do. In one case, an island still invaded with rats and with a low seabird nesting population yielded index values similar to an uninvaded and healthy island. Heavy winds and rain during the acoustic recordings may have influenced the indexes in this case, highlighting the importance of understanding the non-biological differences between recording sites, he said.</p>
<p>Borker is now working to get information about soundscape analysis into the hands of conservationists. Organizations such as the Nature Conservancy have already begun taking this soundscape acoustic monitoring approach to other environments.</p>
<p>"This tool can be used to measure change in not one or two species, but an entire ecosystem over time," said coauthor Bernie Tershy, a research biologist in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz. This approach could be used to analyze the changes in all of the species in an environment&#8212;frogs, birds, insects, and more&#8212;all at once, he said.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's unclear which restoration method is best, Borker said, but by using this holistic approach researchers may be able to understand which actions are more effective. Finding tools to measure the status of restored sites that are highly automated is critical to scaling conservation and restoration efforts worldwide.</p>
<p>Borker's efforts have shown that this is now possible, in less time and with less resources than standard acoustic monitoring. "It's exciting&#8212;we can measure conservation outcomes across a community and at large scales," he said.</p>
<p>In addition to Borker, Buxton, and Tershy, the coauthors of this paper include Ian Jones, Heather Major, Jeffrey Williams, and Donald Croll. This work was funded by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Alaska Maritime NWR of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

<p>The Center for the Middle East and North Africa will be directed by UC Santa Cruz associate professor of history Jennifer Derr&#8212;who this past summer received a prestigious $480,780 National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Award. Titled &#8220;The History of Science at the Interface of Biomedical and Environmental Concerns,&#8221; the five-year NSF grant will fund Derr&#8217;s research for two book projects, as well as supplemental funding for graduate training in the history department, plus workshops to be hosted by the campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;UCSC has exceptional faculty strength in the study of North Africa, a field which bridges Africa, Europe, and the Middle East,&#8221; noted Tyler Stovall, dean of humanities at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;In this field we are one of the strongest universities in America, and the new center will further highlight our prominence in this area.&#8221;</p>
<p>The establishment of a Center for the Middle East and North Africa represents the culmination of work by faculty in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Arts Divisions. In 2014, faculty in these divisions began to organize in response to student demand to discuss the possibility of hiring an Arabic language instructor at the university.</p>
<p>In addition to the support of faculty in various divisions, this campaign had the full support of the Jewish Studies Program.</p>
<p>&#8220;One cannot have a complete understanding of the Jewish past without studying the Middle East and North Africa; likewise, one cannot have a complete understanding of the MENA without studying the region's Jews,&#8221; said Alma Heckman, assistant professor of history and Jewish Studies, and the Neufeld-Levin Chair of Holocaust Studies at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the ancient past, Jews have lived across the MENA region, from Morocco to Iran and everywhere in between,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Jewish Studies and MENA Studies are inherently complementary. Working in tandem with the UCSC Center for Jewish Studies, the new MENA Center enriches the unique programmatic offerings at UCSC that connect across Jewish and MENA studies.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p><strong>UCSC&#8217;s Humanities Division </strong>recently received a $370,000 gift from Marieke and Jeff Rothschild to fund building-block resources for three years of language instruction on campus in Arabic and Persian, as well as seed money to begin developing the center. They had previously created an endowment to support the Miriam Ellis International Playhouse at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>These new language courses offer undergraduates the opportunity to learn a valuable skill set while taking classes that have Arabic components in history, literature, politics, film, and linguistics. In addition to giving them a well-rounded education, this will also provide students with critical language skills that will better position them for future success in graduate school, study abroad opportunities, and careers in international relations and global business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Providing the opportunity to UCSC students to understand another culture through its language, history, political and economic systems, and arts is so important, especially for the Middle East and Northern Africa, as it enables an understanding of societies different from the U.S. and creates a global view for students,&#8221; said Marieke Rothschild (Cowell B.A. Language Studies, &#8217;93).&#160; &#8220;UCSC has such broad resources in this field; it is a tremendous opportunity to create a center that can work for the good of the world and I am proud to be a part of this."</p>
<p><strong>Derr noted that students</strong> will be a primary constituency of the center and that every effort will be made to include undergraduate and graduate student populations in the events that the center sponsors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building an undergraduate community that is educated about the culture, history, and politics of the Middle East and North Africa is one of our priorities,&#8221; said Derr. &#8220;Once a funding stream for language training in Middle Eastern languages has been secured, it is my aim to form a minor in Middle Eastern and North African Studies, and eventually a major."&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I plan to organize events in which students, faculty, staff, and community members feel themselves part of a community who are interested in the region." she added. &#8220;Study abroad trips to the region will be one opportunity for students to learn. Film and digital media professor Peter Limbrick is organizing and leading the first of these trips to Morocco in the summer of 2020.&#8221;</p>
<p>The inaugural event for the center is scheduled for February 4 at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center as part of the The Humanities Institute&#8217;s &#8220;Questions that Matter&#8221; series. The event will feature Derr in conversation with two NPR journalists--Hannah Allam and Leila Fadel--who have worked extensively in the Middle East, including in Iraq in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion, and are currently reporting on questions of culture, race, and diversity in the United States.</p>
<p>"We are so excited to play a role in the founding of this new center under the capable leadership of Jennifer Derr,&#8221; noted history professor Nathaniel Deutsch, director of UCSC&#8217;s Humanities Institute. &#8220;After years of work by so many people, we finally have a center at UC Santa Cruz that will study this tremendously&#160;important part of the world."&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dc421e3c80727017605850f748a5c6ae"><name>giving-tuesday</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Collective boost for Slug Support </title><summary>UCSC celebrates success of Giving Tuesday fundraiser focused on student basic needs</summary><keywords>slug support, giving tuesday, fundraising</keywords><start-date>1575653220000</start-date><display-name>giving-tuesday</display-name><path>/2019/12/giving-tuesday</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/12/giving-tuesday</link><created-by>jhillard</created-by><created-on>1575653350936</created-on><last-modified-by>jhillard</last-modified-by><last-modified>1575653681397</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>J.D.

The result is almost double <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/index.html">Slug Support&#8217;s</a> fundraising in all of the 2018&#8211;19 fiscal year, said Mariah Lyons, the program&#8217;s director.<br/><br/>&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled with the generosity and with the number of donors,&#8221; Lyons said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to mean a lot for students who need ongoing food support.&#8221;<br/><br/>Hunger on college campuses is a growing concern across the United States, including in the University of California system. Some estimates indicate that more than 40% of UC students face some degree of food insecurity. <br/><br/>The program will use the fund for its food assistance offerings, including:<br/>
<ul>
<li>grocery store gift cards for those facing short-term challenges</li>
<li>meal swipes for the dining halls</li>
<li>direct financial awards for ongoing food insecurity</li>
<li>food pantries and the Cowell Coffee Shop, which has been transformed into basic needs caf&#233; for students, providing free coffee and tea and a food pantry</li>
</ul>
Slug Support also helps refer students who qualify to apply for CalFresh food assistance. <br/><br/>Giving Tuesday funds also will help undocumented, international, and graduate students, as well as others who often don&#8217;t qualify for CalFresh. Access to nutritious food is critical for academic success, Lyons said.<br/><br/>&#8220;The &#8216;starving student&#8217; narrative that eating ramen three times a day is acceptable&#8212;or even a badge of honor&#8212;has been normalized,&#8221; she said, adding that the adequacy of that legendary mono-diet does not bear out in nutritional science. &#8220;That&#8217;s not brain food.&#8221;<br/><br/>The fundraiser employed the same online networking strategy that has contributed to the growing success of the campus&#8217;s annual Giving Day, the next iteration of which will be April 22. Chancellor Cynthia Larive congratulated the alumni, staff, students, faculty, and friends who activated their networks.<br/><br/>&#8220;This is a wonderful demonstration of the power of community,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;At UC Santa Cruz we all pull for each other.&#8221;<br/><br/>The online-only event piggybacked on the increasingly popular nationwide <a href="https://www.givingtuesday.org/">Giving Tuesday</a>, encouraging gifts to charitable causes during the post-Thanksgiving shopping blitz. Raising funds for student food support seemed especially appropriate following a national holiday celebrating food, family, opportunity, and abundance, according to organizers. Emily Todd, assistant director of digital and annual giving, led the project. <br/><br/>&#8220;There&#8217;s Black Friday and Cyber Monday, a bunch of days when we tend to spend on ourselves,&#8221; Todd said. &#8220;This is a day when we give back.&#8221;<br/><br/>This year&#8217;s result provides a strong benchmark and data that the campus will use to raise even more funds in the future.<br/><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to see how we can use this information to have an even more successful day next year, and help even more students who are struggling to make ends meet,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s room to grow.&#8221;<br/><br/>Learn more about assistance available for students by emailing deanofstudents@ucsc.edu or visiting the Dean of Students office at Hahn Student Services 9 a.m.&#8211;5 p.m. weekdays. For help applying for CalFresh, email calfresh@ucsc.edu<br/><br/>The Cowell Coffee Shop offers food and coffee on a non-transactional basis.

Ten teams from universities around the world were selected from among hundreds of applicants to compete in the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize/challenges/current-challenge/"><span>Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge 3</span></a>.</p>
<p>The Alexa Prize Challenge is designed to advance the field of conversational artificial intelligence (AI). The chosen teams submitted applications that demonstrated a contribution to the scientific field, strong technical merit, and novel ideas to address the challenges of conversational AI.</p>
<p>The UCSC team, named <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize/challenges/current-challenge/teams/ucsc-athena"><span>Athena</span></a>, is led by faculty adviser Marilyn Walker, professor of computer science and engineering, and includes six graduate students and one undergraduate, all working in Walker&#8217;s Natural Language and Dialogue Systems lab at UC Santa Cruz. Each team receives a $250,000 research grant, Alexa-enabled devices, free Amazon Web Services (AWS) to support their development efforts, and access to other tools, data, and Alexa team support.</p>
<p>The teams face the same grand challenge as in previous years: to develop a "socialbot" that can converse coherently with a person for 20 minutes using Alexa, the voice-controlled digital assistant in Amazon's Echo and other devices. The socialbot should be able to engage people in conversation about popular topics such as entertainment, sports, politics, technology, and fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a well-defined challenge to push the technology forward in this area,&#8221; Walker said. &#8220;There are technical challenges with developing algorithms for managing topical coherence, use of context, modeling the user, introducing new topics, and determining who goes next in the conversation. It shows where there are fundamental gaps in our understanding of human language and conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Athena team includes several graduate students who competed in previous years (as part of the SlugBot team) as well as several new members. The current team members are Davan Harrison (team leader), Juraj Juraska, Jiaqi Wu, Kevin Bowden, Lena Reed, Abteen Ebrahimini, and Nikhil Varghese. In addition, there are six undergraduates from psychology and linguistics working on human evaluation of the Athena socialbot, as well as dialogue design and utterance quality. The undergraduates are working with Steve Whittaker, professor of computational media, who brings expertise in human-computer interaction to the project.</p>
<p>The team is taking a new approach this year, with a reconfigured platform and a new code base for the Athena system, Walker said. The Athena socialbot is now available for Alexa customers to try it out. Saying "Alexa let's chat" to an Alexa device or an Alexa app on a mobile phone will put the user into a conversation with one of the socialbots developed by the ten teams in the Alexa Prize Challenge.</p>
<p>The competition began in September, with finals taking place in May and winners announced in June. If any team achieves the grand challenge of conversing coherently and engagingly for 20 minutes, their institution would be rewarded with a $1 million research grant. According to Walker, however, researchers are probably still several years away from reaching that goal.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dd90dabd80727017605850f71b8be527"><name>student-health-services-closures</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student Health Services Closures</title><summary>Student Health Services will be closed on December 17, 2019 from 8:00 am - 1 pm and December 19, 2019 from 8:00 am - 1 pm.&#13;

With dozens of protected wildlands located in a wide variety of ecosystems across the state, the reserves in the UC Natural Reserve System (NRS) are popular places for scientists to collect specimens and do field research.</p>
<p>Trying to determine whether certain species of interest lived on a given reserve, however, wasn&#8217;t as easy as the UC Berkeley graduate student had hoped. Sometimes a reserve&#8217;s species list was incomplete, or in other cases was out of date and considerably older than he was.</p>
<p>Now, as assistant manager of the UC Santa Cruz campus reserve, Krohn is working to remedy that problem. In 2019, he launched a survey of the birds, plants, fish, fungi, insects, vascular plants, mammals, bryophytes (mosses and liverworts), and lichens at all of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Natural Reserves. In time, he wants this biological snapshot to include all 41 reserves now in the NRS.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring for change</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Our data will be used to study how the reserves&#8217; diversity has changed over time. Where no such data exist, our data will serve as a crucial baseline to study future change,&#8221; Krohn said.</p>
<p>Krohn has designed the survey to train students in field biology while benefiting the ecological community. It will not only update knowledge about NRS reserves, but also expose students to field and museum work, while augmenting the collections of UC&#8217;s natural history museums.</p>
<p>&#8220;The survey adds value to the NRS&#8217;s library of ecosystems,&#8221; said Peggy Fiedler, executive director of the NRS. &#8220;Researchers want to know what species occur at which reserves and which times of year they can be found. The specimens and species lists will encourage more studies on NRS lands and improve our ability to protect California&#8217;s biodiversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Krohn&#8217;s plan is to survey UCSC&#8217;s four NRS reserves first as a proof of concept. He hopes the results will inspire other campuses to conduct comprehensive inventories their own NRS reserves.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to show, given relatively little funding and a short amount of time, how much new information we can gather for the reserves about the biodiversity they currently have,&#8221; he said. The first year of the survey cost less than $8,000. The funds have provided stipends for crew leaders and money for gas and collecting equipment.</p>
<p>The survey will focus on one reserve at a time over the course of an entire year. This enables surveyors to witness the full range of seasonal shifts such as migrations, flowering, births, and deaths.</p>
<p><strong>Student surveyors</strong></p>
<p>First up is Younger Lagoon Reserve. Extending across wetlands, coastal terrace, and a beach, the reserve boasts a wide variety of habitat types and species. It&#8217;s an easy site to visit as it&#8217;s located just a few miles from the main UC Santa Cruz campus.</p>
<p>Teams of undergraduates have been sampling the reserve regularly since spring. Each team specializes in a particular type of organism, such as arthropods or plants, and is led by a local expert, graduate student, or knowledgeable undergraduate. The specimens each team collects are deposited at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Norris Center for Natural History, where Krohn is assistant director.</p>
<p>Because the methods are straightforward to conduct and repeat, groups such as classes should be able to update the survey in the future. &#8220;As long as someone is there to help identify what you catch, pretty much anyone can do this survey,&#8221; Krohn said.</p>
<p><strong>A chance to lead</strong></p>
<p>Jessica Correa led the Younger Lagoon insect team last spring. An environmental studies and sociology major, Correa had spent her junior year surveying the insects of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s campus grasslands for her capstone project. Krohn hired her to lead the insect team surveying Younger Lagoon Reserve in spring before she graduated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m usually just part of the team. I hadn&#8217;t been a leader. The survey gave me so much experience in how to manage a team and work with different people&#8217;s schedules,&#8221; Correa says.</p>
<p>Before heading out into the field, Correa helped train her team on how to survey for and collect any specimens they gathered. In the field, she planned how long the team was going to collect, mapped out where each member would trap, and wrangled the most complex traps herself. Back at the Norris Center, she organized sessions for team members to identify, pin, and label insects for the museum&#8217;s permanent collection.</p>
<p><strong>Making connections in the field</strong></p>
<p>The inventory uses tried-and-true sampling protocols at every turn. These include laying wooden boards on the ground to shelter small animals such salamanders and voles, and shining lights that draw insects after dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like hiking with a purpose,&#8221; said Emma Brown, a junior environmental studies major at UC Santa Cruz. A member of the Younger Lagoon insect crew, Brown began collecting with Correa last spring and earned two units for her efforts. She is now a paid intern for the project.</p>
<p>The survey trips have opened Brown&#8217;s eyes to the connections between insects and their environments. She&#8217;s noticed certain species waxing and waning with the weather, observed which reserve soils scarab beetles preferred to breed in, and followed ant-eating wrens to locate the best spot for her ant traps.</p>
<p>Brown feels her participation in the survey is laying the groundwork for her future. &#8220;I plan to keep doing insect collecting and continue on to graduate school,&#8221; Brown said, &#8220;so I know these skills definitely will help me out then.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A new view of museum collections</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This project connects experts here at the museum and the university with our undergraduates to get people involved in research,&#8221; Krohn said. &#8220;They can teach students how to collect and stain a lichen or dry a fungus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Information about each specimen is entered into the Norris Center&#8217;s databases, which feed into the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), an online database of museum specimens and other biodiversity data from around the world. The information will also be available on ReserveMapper, a tool that displays specimens collected specifically from NRS reserves.</p>
<p>By doing the preservation and cataloging themselves, students &#8220;come away understanding how natural history museums are a library for life, and have a new appreciation for all they do outside of exhibits and displays visible to the public,&#8221; Krohn said.</p>
<p>It also eases the burdens of reserve managers. While most have years of training in the natural sciences, it&#8217;s virtually impossible for one person to possess the specialized knowledge required to differentiate similar-looking species from all taxa. For example, distinguishing certain species of moths requires dissecting their reproductive parts, while some lizards can only be told apart by counting their scales.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can take that work off the shoulders of reserve managers, who might not be experts in how to properly store plants or prepare museum specimens either,&#8221; Krohn explained.</p>
<p><strong>Baseline data</strong></p>
<p>The project comes not a moment too soon given the magnitude of human impacts on the natural world, Correa said. Not only are amphibians and large mammals in deep declines, but some entomologists fear a so-called &#8220;insect apocalypse&#8221; has left populations of arthropods at potentially catastrophic lows.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to be studying it before the species decline,&#8221; Correa said.</p>
<p>The survey also afforded students a bonus: getting to experience wilder corners of nature. &#8220;We got to go into part of the reserve where most people are not allowed except to do research. We would find bird bones, small mammal skulls, and we tried to figure out what happened to them. You don&#8217;t get that on Natural Bridges Beach next door; the public is always there,&#8221; Correa said.</p>
<p>Krohn&#8217;s ambitions for the survey have been borne out by early results. After one quarter of surveying, students increased the number of lichens known from Younger by 430%, and insects by more than 1000%. The trend held true even among relatively well characterized groups; students found two new species of snake never before documented at the lagoon.</p>
<p>At Younger Lagoon, groups like birds and plants have been well documented. But other taxa at the reserve, like fungi and lichens, were not nearly as well known.</p>
<p>Younger Lagoon Reserve Director Elizabeth Howard said getting information about these other groups of organisms is going to be a huge bonus. &#8220;Once we have those resources, we&#8217;ll start to see research questions and projects on those taxa,&#8221; she said. And that will benefit individual researchers and encourage more people to expand our understanding of the natural world.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ed435e0d80727017605850f7e7b871be"><name>grade-strike-info</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fall grades: information and resources</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is committed to ensuring that the illegal work stoppage does not impede students’ academic progress.

<h2>Background and Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Some UC Santa Cruz graduate students have said they will not turn in fall quarter grades unless the campus acts to reopen contract negotiations. While we sympathize with the concerns raised by the students, labor law prohibits the campus from direct dealing in a contract negotiated at the system level.More importantly, we are committed to ensuring that this unsanctioned work stoppage does not impede our undergraduate students&#8217; academic progress at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

<h2 id="student_impacts">Questions: Student impacts</h2>
<h3 id="impactonundergraduatestudents">What impact is the grade strike having on UCSC&#8217;s undergraduate students?</h3>
<p>It has been said that the grade strike is a &#8220;victimless&#8221; action. However, when students do not have grades, it can have a profound, and perhaps unexpected, impact on student success including:</p>
<h4 id="lossoffinancialaid">Loss of Financial Aid</h4>
<p>The Department of Education (DOE) requires verification of student academic progress. If the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office&#8217;s (FASO) cannot verify a student&#8217;s eligibility, financial aid must be adjusted (decreased) and funds returned leaving students responsible for the difference. Moreover, while the FASO will make all attempts to reinstate a financial aid award once the grades are submitted, in some cases, depending on individual factors including the type of aid involved, the reduction in aid may be irreversible.</p>
<h4 id="enrollmentdifficulties">Enrollment Difficulties</h4>
<p>Missing grades, and the resulting lack of credits, can impact a student&#8217;s prerequisites, academic standing, and even their ability to enroll in a course restricted to their class level (i.e., senior seminar). Likewise, a lack of credits&#8212;resulting from missing grades&#8212;can impact a student&#8217;s position during enrollment possibly impacting their ability to get into more popular classes.</p>
<h4 id="abilitytoapplyforgraduation">Ability to Apply for Graduation</h4>
<p>Without grades, some students may not be able to successfully apply for graduation. The Office of the Registrar may not be able to grant a degree for a student who is missing a grade. Additionally, missing grades prohibit the determination of whether a student qualifies for any academic honors.</p>
<h4 id="abilitytodeclareamajor">Ability to Declare a Major</h4>
<p>Students with missing grades may not be able to declare a major by the February 7 deadline.</p>
<h4 id="timelytranscriptreceipt">Timely Transcript Receipt</h4>
<p>Without grades, the Office of the Registrar will be unable to provide a complete transcript which may impact applications to transfer, graduate school, external programs or external scholarships.</p>
<h3 id="whatifhavefinalgradesafterfeb2">What happens if some students still don&#8217;t have final grades after Feb. 2?</h3>
<p>Campus leaders sincerely hope that all grades will be in by the Feb. 2 deadline. When students do not have grades, it can have a profound impact on their financial aid; their ability to enroll in classes they need; to apply for graduation; or even declare a major. Likewise, it can impact legal reporting requirements of UCSC&#8217;s undocumented students, veterans, and those under academic review.</p>
<h3 id="assignmissinggrades">Will the administration assign grades to students who are missing theirs?</h3>
<p>Campus administration cannot assign grades; grades are final when faculty submit grades on MyUCSC. The campus has asked department or program chairs to make themselves available to instructors to help them make decisions regarding final grade assignments and address situations that may impede the submission of grades.</p>
<h3 id="howwillfinalgradesbedetermined">How will final grades be determined?</h3>
<p>Students should reach out to their instructor to understand any changes or adjustments in the determination of final grades. The campus has asked chairs to make themselves available to instructors to help them make decisions regarding final grade assignments and address situations that may impede the submission of grades.</p>
<h3 id="gradesforcompletedwork">Will students receive an &#8220;incomplete&#8221; grade even if they completed the work?</h3>
<p>No. Incomplete grades should only be assigned by the instructor of record when requested by the student, and when the student has completed work of passing quality, but the student&#8217;s work is not yet complete.</p>
<h3 id="assignmentoffinalgrade">What are the options for managing the assignment of the final grade?</h3>
<p>The campus has asked department or program chairs to make themselves available to instructors to help them make decisions regarding final grade assignments and address situations that may impede the submission of grades.</p>
<h3 id="instructorsdelayedgrades">Should instructors enter an incomplete (I) for missing or delayed grades?</h3>
<p>No. Grades of incomplete (I) should not be used as a substitute for grades that are delayed by the illegal work stoppage. In accordance with Senate regulations, incomplete grades should only be assigned when individually requested by the student, and when the student has completed work of passing quality, but the student&#8217;s work is not yet complete. An incomplete, as a grade, will cause the student to be dropped from any future courses that require completion of the class as a prerequisite. While advocated by the wildcat strike leaders, incomplete grades should not be assigned unless the normal requirements for assigning an incomplete are met.</p>
<h3 id="graduatefallquarter">What if a student was planning to graduate fall quarter?</h3>
<p>The degrees for students who applied to graduate in fall quarter will still be processed for fall 2019. The campus will work quickly to process graduation applications once all grades are reported.</p>
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<h3 id="wildcatstrike">What is a "wildcat" strike?</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz graduate students employed as academic student employees are currently represented by the United Autoworkers and under a contract that was ratified in 2018.</p>
<p>The University of California&#8217;s collective bargaining agreement governs the terms and conditions of employment for readers, tutors, teaching assistants, and graduate student instructors. This contract, including its rights and obligations, applies if a graduate student has an active appointment in one of these positions.</p>
<p>Under the terms of that agreement, academic student employees cannot engage in any strikes, work stoppages, interruptions of work, or any activity that directly or indirectly interferes with university operations while a contract is in place. Withholding grades is direct interference with the university&#8217;s operations and a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>When a group of employees represented by a union defies that union and stages an unauthorized strike, it is known as a &#8220;wildcat strike.&#8221;</p>
<h3 id="meetwithstrikingstudents">Why didn&#8217;t the university meet with the striking graduate students?</h3>
<p>The grade strike is unsanctioned by their union and the striking graduate students are working outside of the union in making demands of the University. Labor law prohibits this direct dealing between employees and their employer, which excludes employees&#8217; lawfully recognized union. The University has responded to striking graduate students explaining this issue.</p>
<h3 id="canuawnegotiate">Can local UAW leaders negotiate for graduate students across the system?</h3>
<p>No, the local UC Santa Cruz UAW representative is not authorized to negotiate on behalf of all graduate students in the collective bargaining process or for employees who are not members of UAW. The University of California negotiated a systemwide contract with UAW 2865, a contract which spans the UC campuses across the state. To discuss terms and conditions of employment, our campus must work through and with the systemwide UAW 2865 organization; this is true even if our campus did not vote to ratify the agreement. Additionally, this contract applies to readers, tutors, teaching assistants and graduate student instructors &#8212; not all graduate students.</p>
<h3 id="graduatestudentsearn">How much do graduate students currently earn?</h3>
<p>Graduate students in doctoral and MFA programs are supported through fellowships, research and teaching assistantships. Graduate student teaching assistants receive a compensation package for their 50% time appointment that includes tuition remission, an annual 3% salary increase, and benefits including health insurance and reimbursement of child care expenses.</p>
<p>In terms of the general number for graduate student support (in this instance, accepted offers), of the &gt;350 students who accepted our doctoral offers last year, their average offers (all things included&#8212;stipend, fees, tuition, GSHIP) was over $43,000.</p>
<p>Highlights of the 2018&#8211;2022 UAW contract agreement with academic student employees includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wages</strong>: Annual wage increases of 3 percent for the next four years, beginning Oct. 1, 2018.</li>
<li><strong>Child care</strong>: A child care subsidy of $3,300/year ($1100 per quarter/$1650 per semester).</li>
<li><strong>Fees</strong>: Effective Jan. 1, 2019, $300 per academic year for campus fee remission ($100 per quarter; $150 per semester). This is a new benefit for ASEs.</li>
<li><strong>Sexual Harassment</strong>: Establishing a joint labor-management committee to address sexual harassment issues and training, and give ASEs a voice on this important issue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="housingfunds">The graduate students requested a Cost of Living Adjustment of $1412/month. Is this the amount that you will be providing as part of the housing funds?</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is in no position and has no authority to separately change an already agreed-upon, system-wide labor contract with the UAW.</p>
<p>The solution to the housing crisis is to build more housing. However, until more graduate-level student housing becomes available, UC Santa Cruz is instituting a need-based annual housing supplement of $2,500 for doctoral and MFA students in good standing, offered through Financial Aid in partnership with the Graduate Division</p>
<h3 id="disciplinaryaction">Why is the university taking disciplinary action?</h3>
<p>The university is committed to ensuring that all people may exercise the constitutionally protected rights of free expression, speech, and assembly. The right of free speech in a university includes the right to acts of peaceful dissent, protests in peaceable assembly, and orderly demonstrations.</p>
<p>It is important to know that these rights are subject to restrictions based on time, place, and manner rules, and a violation of these rules may lead to discipline. For example, UC policy does not allow expressive activity to disrupt the regular and essential operations of the university, such as our ability to offer classes, administer exams, carry on research, or run the university in general, or block or impede ingress to or egress from the campus or buildings.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated><value>Yes</value></show-updated><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ed4ffcda80727017605850f7c01d91df"><name>addressing-impacts-of-grad-student-strike</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Addressing impacts of graduate student grade strike</title><summary>Some UC Santa Cruz graduate students have said they will not turn in fall quarter grades unless the campus provides them with more financial support to help defray the high cost of housing in Santa Cruz.</summary><start-date>1575878400000</start-date><display-name>Addressing impacts of graduate student grade strike</display-name><path>/2019/12/addressing-impacts-of-grad-student-strike</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/12/addressing-impacts-of-grad-student-strike</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1575939472571</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1575939472571</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Some UC Santa Cruz graduate students have said they will not turn in fall quarter grades unless the campus provides them with more financial support to help defray the high cost of housing in Santa Cruz.

But it may be drawing attention away from the value of other habitat that could truly help the endangered species in its recovery&#8212;estuaries.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In fact, a new study released today concludes that California could more than triple its population of southern sea otters, from an estimated 3,000 to nearly 10,000, by repopulating the largest estuary on the coast&#8212;the San Francisco Bay.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It would essentially end up lifting the sea otter out of its endangered species status,&#8221; said Brent Hughes, assistant professor of biology at Sonoma State and lead </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">author of</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> the study <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8100/">published in </a></span><a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8100/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>PeerJ: the Journal of Life and Environmental Sciences</i></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">. &#8220;For the conservation of the sea otter, this would be huge.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Hughes did pioneering research on the ecological role of sea otters in Elkhorn Slough as a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz, where he worked with Tim Tinker and Kerstin Wasson, both coauthors of the new paper and adjunct professors of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Elkhorn Slough&#8217;s protected habitats provide a special haven for sea otters, as well as remarkable opportunities for studying them,&#8221; said Wasson, who is research coordinator for the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve. &#8220;Sea otters were associated with kelp forests only because the surviving southern sea otters off of Big Sur were in that habitat; if you go back in history, you&#8217;d be as likely to think of otters as salt marsh and seagrass animals, and indeed, there used to be more in San Francisco Bay than the entire southern population size now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Recovery plans</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">According to Hughes and his coauthors, current southern sea otter recovery plans have not included estuaries as target habitats. This &#8220;may be an artifact of where the surviving population persisted,&#8221; they concluded in their paper, titled &#8220;Species recovery and recolonization of past habitats: Lessons for science and conservation from sea otters in estuaries.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The dogma, widely reinforced in both the scientific and popular media, is that sea otters do best in saltwater kelp forests,&#8221; said Brian Silliman, Rachel Carson associate professor of marine conservation biology at Duke University&#8217;s Nicholas School of the Environment and a partner in the study. &#8220;But this is based on studies and observations made while these populations were in sharp decline. Now that they are rebounding, they&#8217;re surprising us by demonstrating how adaptable and cosmopolitan they really are.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"This really changes our view of the ecological role of sea otters,&#8221; said Tinker. "They are not only keystone marine mammals of the outer coast, they are also important apex predators in estuarine habitats."</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Remnant population</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The southern sea otter was widely believed to be extinct due to the expansive fur trade of the 18th and 19th centuries, which reduced the global population from between 150,000 and 300,000 to roughly 2,000. Then in 1914 a remnant population of about 50 southern sea otters was found along the rugged Big Sur shoreline. Thanks to conservation efforts, the population has since grown to more than 3,000, but their numbers are still far below their historic numbers and range.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">While conservation efforts have focused on protecting otters in these rocky coastal habitats, evidence shows that southern sea otters were once abundant in California estuaries, including in San Francisco Bay. Early accounts by Spanish explorers noted otter populations as far south as San Jose and as far north as Richardson Bay. &#8220;Sea otters&#160;</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">probably numbered in the thousands in this estuary prior to being driven to local extinction by over-hunting,&#8221; the researchers noted.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The only estuary in California that is currently home to a distinct and self-sustaining population of sea otters is Elkhorn Slough at Moss Landing in Monterey Bay. Overall, southern sea otters have only recolonized about 13 percent of their historic range, according to the study.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Hughes said one of the reasons otter habitat has remained fragmented and why sea otters have not been able to migrate north and reestablish residency in San Francisco Bay is the presence of great white sharks near the Golden Gate. &#8220;We call it &#8216;the gauntlet,&#8217;&#8221; said Hughes. &#8220;Otters really can&#8217;t get past the gauntlet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">But if otter populations were established inside San Francisco Bay and out of the range of great whites, they would become the top predator and would likely thrive.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Using existing studies and modeling of sea otter growth, the researchers concluded that the San Francisco Bay could support about 6,600 sea otters, more than twice the current estimated population of 3,000. &#8220;It would change the game in terms of how we look at sea otter conservation,&#8221; Hughes said.</span>&#160;</p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Along with Sonoma State University, this study was a result of extensive collaboration between researchers and managers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Western Ecological Research Center of the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Park Service, Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Hakai Institute, San Francisco State University, San Diego State University, California Polytechnic State University, UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, and Duke University.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f0f5964b80727017605850f7f461eb47"><name>uc-path-launching</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCPath goes live at UCSC on Jan. 2</title><summary>UC Path will go live at UC Santa Cruz on Jan. 2.</summary><start-date>1575964800000</start-date><display-name>UC Path</display-name><path>/2019/12/uc-path-launching</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/12/uc-path-launching</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1576000656939</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1576000656939</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>UC Path Team</name><title></title><phone/><email>ucpath@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><ul>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03688-w">new commentary</a> entitled "Women from some under-represented minorities are given too few talks at world&#8217;s largest Earth-science conference"&#160;that appears in the Dec. 4 edition of <em>Nature</em>, researchers describe their evaluation&#8212;the first of its kind&#8212;of speaking opportunities for ethnic and racial minorities at scientific conferences. Margarita Azmitia, professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz, is a coauthor of the commentary, with Heather Ford of Queen Mary University of London; Cameron Brick of University of Cambridge; Karine Blaufuss of the American Geophysical Union (AGU); and Petra Dekens, of San Francisco State University. Both Ford and Dekens earned their Ph.D.s in ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The research also provides data on intersectionality, where more than one form of bias may be found: women of color, specifically, were given fewer opportunities. The analysis is similar to the problem of gender bias in science, which has been identified as an important root of the underrepresentation of women in STEM.</p>
<p>"These biases and stereotypes also occur in STEM classes in high school and college, and they contribute to the migration of underrepresented students to non-STEM majors and professions where they feel more accepted, competent, and validated," said Azmitia, who studies the college experiences of underrepresented students.</p>
<p>Previous studies have found women and minorities are disadvantaged in hiring or promotion decisions, awarding of grants, invitations to conferences, nominations for awards, forming professional collaborations, and serving as peer reviewers for scholarly publications.</p>
<p>The research focused on the annual conference of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), an international non-profit scientific association with approximately 60,000 members in 137 countries. The study examined data collected from presentation abstracts submitted to the AGU Fall Meeting, the world&#8217;s largest Earth and space science conference, between 2014 to 2017, combined with AGU member data concealing their identities.</p>
<p>The analysis showed that while female scientists as a whole had equal or more opportunities to speak at the Fall Meeting, women from ethnic minorities were invited to give fewer talks, invited to give talks less often, and opted for poster presentations more than researchers who were not from underrepresented minorities.</p>
<p>Azmitia noted that &#8220;double blind peer review" of conference presentations, scholarly publications, and grants is essential to increase inclusion and equity at AGU and professional outlets in other disciplines. "When reviewers&#8212;often senior white males&#8212;know the identity and rank of the authors of submissions, implicit biases influence their decisions and maintain the underrepresentation of women and minorities in the academy,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;These results show that conferences, and really the entire STEM community, need to be more proactive about creating an inclusive environment for under-represented minority groups," said Ford. "There are tangible steps the community can take to support these scientists.&#8221;</p>
<p><u>About the methodology</u></p>
<p>Abstracts are submitted to topical sessions. Sessions are proposed and organized&#8212;and abstracts vetted&#8212;by a group of conveners that includes academics, industry members, and government scientists. The primary convener must be an AGU member. In addition to receiving invitations to present in a session, scientists can also submit abstracts for poster and oral presentations.</p>
<p>The AGU has been aware of the need to increase diversity of speakers at its meetings and has taken steps in recent years to address the issue, according to the organization. For example, prior to the 2019 Fall Meeting, being held this week in San Francisco, AGU President Robin Bell and AGU Fall Meeting Chair Denis-Didier Rousseau wrote a letter to all session conveners encouraging them to include diverse and early-career scientists among their co-conveners and session chairs, and to have diverse and young researchers play active roles as oral presenters in their sessions.</p>
<p>While the AGU has been actively working to increase diversity at its meetings, the organization participated in the new study to better understand the issue, said Brooks Hanson, AGU&#8217;s executive vice president of science. The results of the new study highlight the need for scientific societies to continue to make additional efforts to combat bias, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data from our Fall Meetings show AGU is on the right track in our efforts to incorporate more diverse ethnic and gender voices among our cadre of co-conveners and sessions presenters, and we are continuing our efforts to increase diversity at all AGU meetings,&#8221; Hanson said. &#8220;AGU wants to ensure all meeting participants feel safe, welcomed, and included, and that our meetings promote and help reflect diversity, inclusion and excellence in science.&#8221;</p>

<p>Getoor was recognized for &#8220;contributions to machine learning, reasoning under uncertainty, and responsible data science.&#8221;</p>
<p>Responsible data science refers to efforts that address both the technical and societal issues in emerging data-driven technologies. Getoor, a leading advocate for responsible data science, is well known for her research in the areas of machine learning and reasoning under uncertainty, as well as data management, visual analytics, and social network analysis. She founded an important and growing area known as statistical relational learning, which integrates logical and probabilistic reasoning.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, Getoor leads an interdisciplinary team working to address the challenges of incompleteness, uncertainty, and bias in large, heterogeneous sets of interconnected data. This project is part of a major National Science Foundation program (called TRIPODS) to develop the theoretical foundations of data science. Getoor also directs the <a href="https://d3.ucsc.edu/">D3 Data Science Research Center</a>, a collaboration between academia and industry designed to develop open-source tools for collecting data, discovering patterns, and making decisions.</p>
<p>A fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Getoor received the UC Santa Barbara Distinguished Alumna Award in 2019. Also in 2019, she gave the UC Santa Cruz Faculty Research Lecture and received the UCSC Women in Science &amp; Engineering Award.</p>

Millhauser&#8217;s lab, like many other labs in the Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, needs a reliable supply of liquid helium for the instruments that are crucial to his research. But he&#8217;s found that getting liquid helium when you need it is becoming increasingly difficult.<br/><br/>Now, thanks to a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Millhauser has procured equipment that will allow roughly 90% of the helium used in these critical instruments to be captured and reused.<br/><br/>A nonrenewable by-product of petroleum and natural gas drilling, helium has a wide range of uses. Liquid helium is an essential coolant for powerful superconducting magnets, such as those used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines. Millhauser and other UCSC researchers use a related technique called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which also relies on superconducting magnets and liquid helium.<br/><br/>For nearly three decades, Millhauser has been researching the structural and dynamic properties of proteins to better understand human biology and diseases. Currently, he focuses on the structure of prion proteins and their role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. The instruments in UCSC&#8217;s NMR Facility, which Millhauser directs, enable his team to study the shapes of prions and other proteins.<br/><br/>NMR and MRI machines need a regular supply of liquid helium to keep them running. With a temperature of about -450 degrees Fahrenheit, liquid helium keeps the coils of the magnets so cold that electrons can flow without any resistance (called superconductivity). If the coils warm up, the electrons won&#8217;t flow freely and the magnet will stop working.<br/><br/>The liquid helium coolant is steadily lost through evaporation and has to be replaced on a regular basis. The supply of helium is variable, however, and international tensions and changes in fossil fuel energy demands have driven up the cost and decreased availability. The situation is now so dire that all helium deliveries to UC campuses are managed by purchasing agents in the UC Office of the President.<br/><br/>In early 2019, when Millhauser's helium supplier offered a delivery date that was months away, he and NMR Facility Manager Jack Lee realized that ongoing research projects using NMR instruments were in jeopardy. "It was alarming," he said. Some labs at other universities had to shut off their NMR instruments altogether, which can damage the magnets and oftens renders the machine unuseable in the future.<br/><br/>Millhauser decided to request funds from the NIH for a helium recovery system. A few weeks later, he learned that his request had led to the initiation of a targeted grant supplement program from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH, which ultimately provided dozens of universities and research institutions across the country with funding for helium recovery systems.<br/><br/>Under Lee&#8217;s guidance, equipment for the recovery system will soon be installed in the NMR Facility alongside the instruments used by UCSC researchers. "It will look like plumbing&#8212;tubing, tanks, and pumps," Millhauser said. As the helium inside the machine transitions from a liquid to a gas, tubes will collect and move the helium gas into a separate storage tank. A compressor will then liquify the helium, allowing it to be stored and used to replenish the magnets as needed.<br/><br/>Once this recovery system is installed, UCSC likely won't need to place another order for liquid helium for several years, Millhauser said. The reduced need for external helium supplies also mean the costs to run the lab and its experiments are likely to remain stable.<br/><br/>Millhauser sees the new equipment as one way that the university will become less reliant on the petroleum industry and more self-sufficient.<br/><br/>"With the addition of this helium recovery system, we have greater independence from the energy industry and greater stability for our ongoing, federally funded research," he said.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fbf0a49980727017605850f7034343e0"><name>cardenas-first-gen-researcher</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Raising awareness of ‘deficit thinking’</title><summary>Undergraduate researcher works to combat harmful perceptions many first-generation students experience</summary><author>J.D.

After all-Spanish-speaking pre-K and kindergarten, 1st grade was English only. Cardenas sat separate from the other students. <br/><br/>&#8220;It was a really big transition. I just remember feeling isolated,&#8221; said Cardenas (Merrill &#8216;20, psychology, Latin American and Latinx studies). &#8220;I literally had no idea what they were talking about.&#8221;<br/><br/>The situation affected how her teachers and fellow students saw her and how she interacted with them. She felt she was seen not as a 6-year-old learning her 1st grade lessons in a new language, but as someone who was less capable.<br/><br/>&#8220;A lot of people had a lot of assumptions of me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I felt I had to fight against that.&#8221;<br/>
<h3>&#8220;Deficit thinking&#8221;</h3>
<p>That story is how Cardenas explains the concept of &#8220;deficit thinking.&#8221; The term refers to the presumption that performance challenges arise from innate weaknesses rather than circumstances. It is the subject of her undergraduate research in Professor Rebecca Covarrubias&#8217;s <a href="https://rcovarrubias.sites.ucsc.edu/">Culture and Achievement Collaborative</a>, or &#8220;Collab.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cardenas has been working with graduate student and fellow collab, Giselle Laiduc&#160;(Ph.D. '22, social psychology), analyzing surveys of undergraduates Laiduc collected for her own thesis. Under Laiduc's guidance, Cardenas is analyzing the surveys to explore defeicit thinking in interactions between students and tutors.&#160;</p>
<p>Tutoring is an important part of the university's support for student success, and Cardenas has first-hand experience to draw on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m someone who really uses tutoring a lot,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Circumstances common for first-generation undergraduates can result in misperceptions by tutors, she says. And the result can hamper academic progress.<br/><br/>She offers the example of test review. Tutors often encourage students to attend group review sessions before important tests. College students who have jobs, however, might not be able to fit an additional appointment into a busy schedule. A tutor might perceive a student who misses a prep session as undisciplined, when they were in fact making sure they could pay rent.</p>
<p>Cardenas&#8217; work provides an example of strong, compassionate leadership for her fellow students, Covarrubias said.<br/><br/>&#8220;She is also pushing us to think more critically about meaningful ways to better serve and conduct research in collaboration with low-income, first-generation students of color,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Cardenas brings a keen understanding of the critical issues that first-generation students confront at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;<br/><br/>Like many of the student scholars in the Collab, she draws from her own expertise and that of her community to think carefully and sensitively about how to improve the collective experience of first-generation students.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I can make a difference here&#8221;</h3>
<p>The Collab partners with the campus Lerning Support Services department. Covarrubias credits Charis Herzon, director of learning support services, for making it possible to develop and implement evidence-based practices built on the students' research.&#160;</p>
<p>Cardenas hopes her research might influence tutors and others in teaching roles to be aware of their perceptions and find ways to adapt to the circumstances of their students. <br/><br/>&#8220;I can actually make a difference here,&#8221; Cardenas said. &#8220;I can highlight these deficit attributions and how harmful they are.&#8221;<br/><br/>Cardenas plans to work toward a Ph.D. and seek a professorship combining her current dual majors, psychology and Latin American/Latinx studies, to examine how identity affects mental health and overall well-being.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0060b10180727017605850f7a5bc7e47"><name>faculty-message-grades</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>On submitting fall quarter grades</title><summary>Faculty members are responsible for assigning and submitting final course grades.

Winter is the perfect time to start planning for summer. This year there are more than 350 courses offered from marine ecology and intro to jazz, to natural history illustration and vampire film. There are also over 50 online classes offered, like hip hop history and intro to game art production, so students can take summer anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most courses are five credits and take place during one of the two five-week sessions. Extended again this year, eligible high school students get half off tuition to encourage college preparation and major exploration. Students can attend High School Summer University on-campus or online.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We pride ourselves on offering the courses UCSC students need to graduate,&#8221; said Monica Parikh, director of Summer Session. &#8220;And summer is also a unique time when classes are open to everyone. Staff, community members, high schoolers from around the world, and students from other universities can come live and learn on our fabulous campus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With multiple sessions, summer allows ample time to study with top-notch faculty, while still having time to work and have fun.</span></p>

This innovative professional degree program will give students a strong background in the advanced computational technologies used to process and analyze the natural language that humans speak and write.</p>
<p>The one-year (11-month) program, administered by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, is designed to meet the growing need for people with expertise in the rapidly growing field of natural language processing. The initial cohort of students will start in fall 2020, and the deadline for applications is February 3.</p>
<p>Natural language processing is the foundation for voice-controlled digital assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple&#8217;s Siri, as well as machine translation, internet search engines, and a growing number of other applications.</p>
<p>Natural language processing focuses on the development of computer programs that can understand, generate, and learn from human language. It provides algorithms, methods, and tools for analyzing both text and speech, and it provides key capabilities for many areas of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>&#8220;Conversational AI is huge these days,&#8221; said Marilyn Walker, a professor of computer science and engineering and director of the new NLP Program. &#8220;There is also a lot of work in the area of extracting knowledge from text. All the big tech companies, like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, are working in these areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Job opportunities in natural language processing can be found in industry, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations, she said.</p>
<p>"By staying at the forefront of emerging disciplines, we can help our graduates forge meaningful careers and explore new ways to positively impact the world," said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. "The Natural Language Processing master's degree is a good example of how Baskin Engineering creates new interdisciplinary academic programs that are relevant for today and for tomorrow."</p>
<p>The NLP master&#8217;s program will involve UCSC faculty in computer science and engineering, psychology, and linguistics, including leading experts in natural language processing. Students will receive practical training in areas such as data science, core aspects of linguistic theory, and specific applications of natural language processing.</p>
<p>Students will also work in teams to complete a substantial capstone project to develop hands-on, practical skills. The program will take advantage of its proximity to Silicon Valley to connect students with industry mentors for their capstone projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;The technology in this field is so rich and complex, traditional master&#8217;s programs that aren&#8217;t focused on natural language processing would have a hard time giving students all the background they need to work in this field,&#8221; Walker said. &#8220;Our aim is provide an intensive education in just one year that will give students the depth and breadth needed to work in the field of natural language processing.&#8221;</p>

His talk, which is now online at <a href="https://go.ted.com/enricoramirezruiz">go.ted.com/enricoramirezruiz</a>, explored how we are all connected&#8212;fundamentally, universally, and atomically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our atoms participated in an epic odyssey with time-spans from billions of years to mere centuries&#8212;all leading to you,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz said in his talk.</p>
<p>He explained that we are all connected by the birth, death, and rebirth of stars: the iron in your blood, the oxygen you breathe, and the silicon in your phone were created in the life cycles of stars. Stellar explosions (supernovas) transform lighter elements (hydrogen and helium, for example) into heavier ones like iron and oxygen. And these elements are always cycling through our bodies and through other living and nonliving systems on our planet. Cosmic and human history are intertwined through this continuous elemental recycling.</p>
<p>A theoretical astrophysicist, Ramirez-Ruiz develops novel computer simulations to explore transient phenomena such as collisions, mergers, and disruptions of stars. He established the <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/lamat/">Lamat program</a> at UC Santa Cruz to give undergraduate students the opportunity to work with UCSC faculty and graduate students on computational astrophysics projects.

<p>Seth Rubin, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, said the new findings, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6471/eaaw2106">published December 13 in <em>Science</em></a>, emerged from his team&#8217;s research on the structures of the protein molecules the drug interacts with.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is important for understanding why certain cancers are resistant to palbociclib and why breast cancer cells can develop resistance,&#8221; said Rubin, the corresponding author of the paper. &#8220;It explains the mechanism of the drug and allows people to think about designing new drugs that would better overcome resistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rubin&#8217;s lab was focusing on a protein called CDK4 (a cyclin-dependent kinase), which drives cell proliferation by partnering with other proteins to inactivate the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Rb is a molecular gatekeeper that, in its active form, stops the cell from progressing through the cycle of cell growth and division.</p>
<p>Palbociclib (and the related drugs ribociclib and abemaciclib) was designed to target CDK4 and block it from inactivating Rb. The drugs were developed by testing them against a purified complex of CDK4 and the protein that activates it, called cyclin D. Rubin was interested in a third protein, called p27, which is also involved in regulating CDK4. So his team determined the structure of the whole three-protein complex as it occurs in cells, with CDK4, cyclin D, and p27.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we solved the structure with p27, we were surprised to see that it looked like the drug wouldn&#8217;t be able to bind to it,&#8221; Rubin said. &#8220;So we tested it, and sure enough, the drug doesn&#8217;t bind and can&#8217;t inactivate the protein complex with p27.&#8221;</p>
<p>Further research using breast cancer cells yielded more clues to what the drug is actually doing. The results indicate that instead of inhibiting the active CDK4 complex, palbociclib binds to CDK4 alone and prevents it from forming the active complex with cyclin D and p27. This then leads to inhibition of a different cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK2, blocking it from inactivating Rb.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the drug not only prevents CDK4 assembly, it also indirectly inhibits CDK2,&#8221; Rubin explained. &#8220;When cancer cells develop resistance, it&#8217;s often because they start to turn up CDK2 activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rubin&#8217;s lab collaborated with researchers at UCSF and Roswell Park Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York, on this research. First author Keelan Guiley is a graduate student in Rubin&#8217;s lab.

The annual award is the division's highest honor for faculty achievement, recognizing combined excellence in research, teaching, and service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doug Kellogg is a worthy recipient of this award. He is an extraordinary faculty member and leader whose vision, fairness, and research achievements have helped make our campus a leader in biomedical sciences,&#8221; said Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, in a letter announcing the award.</p>
<p>Kellogg&#8217;s research focuses on the mechanisms that control cell growth and size, an area of cell biology that remains poorly understood. Disruption of the normal regulation of cell growth is a hallmark of cancer. Deciphering the cellular signaling pathways that control cell growth and size will help researchers to develop new therapies for treating cancer and other diseases. Earlier this year, Kellogg was awarded a prestigious 5-year Maximizing Investigators&#8217; Research Award from the National Institutes of Health to support his ongoing research in this area.</p>
<p>A talented and devoted teacher and mentor for students and postdoctoral scientists, Kellogg is also a champion of diversity. His lab has hosted 24 undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, and graduate scholars from UCSC&#8217;s NIH-funded STEM Diversity Programs. Currently, three graduate students and two undergraduates in his lab are from underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>A major contributor to his department and division, Kellogg has served in many important leadership roles over the years. These include serving as chair of the Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, director of the department&#8217;s first NIH Training Grant, and director of the Program in Biomedical Science and Engineering. He is currently associate dean of biology in the division.</p>
<p>&#8220;His research, teaching, and service have all been exceptional, and his efforts to launch and support the umbrella graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences and Engineering has transformed training in this critical portion of the campus&#8217; intellectual portfolio,&#8221; Koch wrote.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1b855e1580727017605850f79714b7ac"><name>mating-systems</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>How genetics and social games drive evolution of mating systems in mammals</title><summary>From monogamy to promiscuity, a new model explains the evolution of diverse mating systems based on the conflict between cooperative and competitive behaviors.</summary><keywords>Barry Sinervo</keywords><start-date>1576771200000</start-date><display-name>How genetics and social games drive evolution of mating systems in mammals</display-name><path>/2019/12/mating-systems</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/12/mating-systems</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1576714722806</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1576772578416</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/12/images/ground-squirrel-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/12/images/ground-squirrel-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ground-squirrel-410.jpg</name><display-name>ground-squirrel-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>224662</file-size><width>410</width><height>394</height></image><image-alt>ground squirrel</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/12/images/ground-squirrel-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/12/images/ground-squirrel-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ground-squirrel-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ground-squirrel-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19741</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>phylogenetic tree diagram</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>A thirteen-lined ground squirrel <em>(Ictidomys tridecemlineatus)</em> at the Pawnee National Grassland in northeastern Colorado.

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">A new model for the evolution of mating systems focuses instead on social interactions driven by genetically determined behaviors, and how competition among different behavioral strategies plays out, regardless of external factors such as defensible resources. In this model, social interactions can drive evolutionary transitions from one mating system to another, and can even drive a population to split into two separate species with different mating systems.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The model is based on three fundamental behavioral strategies: aggression, cooperation, and deception. The conflict between competitive and cooperative social behaviors drives the evolution of the mating systems. In a paper </span><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/706810"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">published December 18 in </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>American Naturalist</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> (online ahead of print publication in the February issue), researchers compared the predictions generated by this model with published data on the mating behavior of 288 species of rodents. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"By and large, everything in our predictions seems to be borne out in rodents," said first author Barry Sinervo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "Our model is a universal equation of sorts for mating systems."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The evolutionary story that emerges from the study goes something like this: An ancestral population of rodents is promiscuous in its mating behavior. Genetic variation within the population results in individuals with distinctive behaviors. Some males are highly aggressive, defend large territories, and mate with as many females as they can. Others are not territorial, but sneak onto the territories of other males for surreptitious mating opportunities. And some are monogamous and defend small territories, cooperating with neighboring males at territorial boundaries. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">These three types can coexist, but any imbalance in the relative advantages of different strategies can lead to the elimination of some behaviors and an evolutionary transition to a species that is, for example, entirely monogamous or entirely polygamous. The cooperative behavior of monogamous males, for example, can include paternal care for the young and the ability recognize and affiliate with other cooperative males, making them stronger in the competition with other strategies.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"They are able to find each other and form colonies, and the bigger the colonies get the stronger they are against the barbarians at the gate. Then they split off from the rest of the population as a separate monogamous species," Sinervo said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This may sound like little more than storytelling, but in fact it emerges from a set of mathematical equations based on game theory and population genetics, and it is supported by extensive research in animal behavior and genetics.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Rock-paper-scissors</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The new paper builds on Sinervo's decades-long research on mating behaviors in California's side-blotched lizards. He showed that three throat colors correspond with different behaviors in the male lizards: blue-throated monogamous males form partnerships and cooperate to protect their territories and their mates; orange-throated males are highly aggressive and usurp territories and mates from other lizards; and yellow-throated males sneak into the territories of other males to mate. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The competition between these strategies takes the form of a rock-paper-scissors game in which orange aggressors defeat blue cooperators, which defeat yellow sneakers, which defeat orange aggressors. Thus, no single type can dominate the population, and the abundance of each rises and falls in cycles. In 2007, Sinervo and his collaborators discovered the same dynamic in the distantly related European common lizard. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"That was when I started thinking that the same thing could be happening in mammals," Sinervo said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In the new paper, Sinervo and two of his longtime collaborators&#8212;Alexis Chaine at the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) in Moulis, France, and Donald Miles at CNRS and Ohio University&#8212;generalized the rock-paper-scissors system and extended it to include additional behaviors such as paternal care for offspring (linked to monogamy). They focused on male strategies to simplify the analysis. Sinervo has documented corresponding female strategies in side-blotched lizards and is currently working to incorporate female strategies into the general model. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The three male behavioral strategies represented in the model are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>Polygyny,</strong></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> characterized by aggression to maintain large territories overlapping with several females, but without paternal care for the offspring, as seen in polygamous mating systems where one male mates with multiple females;</span></li>
<li class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>Monogamy,</strong></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> involving lower aggression and smaller territories, with cooperation at territorial boundaries and investment in paternal care; and</span></li>
<li class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>Sneak,</strong></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> a non-territorial strategy with no paternal care, resulting in sneaking behavior in otherwise territorial systems.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Using a computer to run a mathematical model of these strategies, the researchers simulated the evolution of mating systems over 1,000 generations, varying the strength of different parameters in each simulation. At the start of the simulations, the genes that determine the different strategies were assumed to be equally abundant in the population.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Evolutionarily stable outcomes</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The results of the simulations revealed four evolutionarily stable outcomes determined by the interactions and payoffs (in terms of reproductive success) of the different behavioral strategies. Which stable outcome emerges depends on how much of an advantage each behavior provides. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">One of the key factors influencing the effectiveness of a given strategy is a male&#8217;s ability to recognize which behavioral group other males belong to and choose a neighborhood to settle in where his own strategy will have a competitive advantage. Cooperative, monogamous males need to recognize and affiliate with other cooperative males, whereas aggressive, polygynous males want to avoid other aggressive males and find cooperative males whose territories they can take over. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"It all depends on how good you are at finding the right neighborhood, or how good you are at cooperation and paternal care. By varying these parameters in the model, we were able to find the four different evolutionarily stable states," Sinervo said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">One stable outcome is the rock-paper-scissors dynamic documented in lizards, with the coexistence of all three male strategies. Another stable outcome is the coexistence of polygyny and sneak. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">There are two stable outcomes in which only one strategy survives, either polygyny or monogamy. A mix of polygyny and monogamy is rare and unstable, eventually leading to a pure system of one or the other. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Turning to the empirical data, the researchers found evidence in studies of rodent behavior and territoriality of the mating systems and behavioral strategies described in the model. There is even a type of mole rat found in southern Africa that exhibits the rock-paper-scissors combo of all three male strategies that Sinervo discovered in lizards. He noted that, whereas mutual recognition of male strategies is based on throat colors in the lizards, in mammals it is more likely to be mediated by smells. &#8220;It&#8217;s there, but we don&#8217;t see it. We only saw it in lizards because of their bright colors,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The researchers analyzed the phylogenetic tree of rodents (representing the evolutionary relationships among rodent species) and found the same patterns they had seen in the simulations. Species at the base of the phylogenetic tree, closer to the common ancestor of all rodents, tend to be promiscuous, with multiple mating strategies. Polygyny and monogamy very rarely occur together, but they frequently appear in sister species, suggesting they diverged from an ancestral population of mixed strategies. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The model showed that evolutionary transitions in mating systems are largely driven by increases in the benefits of monogamous behaviors. In rodents, monogamy is the most common evolutionary transition from a promiscuous ancestor, and more rodents are monogamous than polygynous. In the simulations, pure polygyny is a relatively uncommon outcome. &#8220;Polygyny is readily invaded by the sneak strategy,&#8221; Sinervo explained.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Paternal care</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Paternal care for the offspring is found in all monogamous species, supporting a key assumption linking paternal care to the evolution of monogamy.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"Promiscuity is very common, and can involve two or three different strategies. But the neat thing is that cooperation and monogamy are far more common than anyone realized," Sinervo said. "The frequency of monogamy in rodents is about 26 percent, much higher than for mammals in general and similar to primates."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The model assumes that these behavioral strategies are genetically based. Evidence in support of this includes research on the role of the hormone vasopressin (and the related hormone oxytocin) in complex social behaviors in numerous species, including rodents and humans. In the monogamous prairie voles, for example, vasopressin has been linked to pair bonding, mate guarding, and paternal care. In some rodent lineages, evolutionary transitions between monogamy and polygyny have been linked to a mutation in a vasopressin receptor gene. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The effects of the genes underlying monogamous behaviors may even drive the evolution of more advanced forms of sociality. Highly social species of rodents&#8212;such as mole rats, some of which live in colonies in which only one pair reproduces&#8212;originate from monogamous lineages.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sinervo and his coauthors are not claiming that resources and other external ecological factors have no role in the evolution of mating systems. But the genetic model gives predictions that are consistent with the rodent data and can explain cases where a species' mating system does not match its resource ecology. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The authors also acknowledged that animal behavior can be very flexible and is not entirely determined by genetics. This is especially true in humans, whose behavior is so strongly influenced by cultural and environmental factors. In terms of mating systems, our species can be described as promiscuous, but with very high rates of monogamy. Sinervo said he sees a connection between monogamy and the deeply cooperative social behaviors that are at the core of the human condition. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">We can see analogues for human behavior in other animals, but there&#8217;s really nothing else like humans,&#8221; Sinervo said. &#8220;There are &#8216;kneejerk&#8217; behavioral impulses in us that are not far from rodents, but our cultural and social complexity makes us very different from most mammals.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/02/3544.html</url><title>Evolutionary game of rock-paper-scissors may lead to new species</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2007/10/1610.html</url><title>Three-way mating game of North American lizard found in distant European relative</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2006/05/864.html</url><title>Greenbeards have blue throats in a breakthrough study of the evolution of altruistic behavior</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1b92266e80727017605850f772e01725"><name>faculty-message-grades1</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Instructions related to grading strike, December 2019</title><summary>It is the responsibility of the instructors of record and departments/colleges to, as best as possible, ensure our students can finish the quarter smoothly.

<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">As you are aware, some graduate students, including teaching assistants (TAs), are participating in a &#8220;wildcat strike,&#8221; and have indicated they will not be submitting fall 2019 grades. Some graduate student instructors (GSIs) may also participate.</span></p>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">It is the responsibility of the instructors of record and departments/colleges to, as best as possible, ensure our students can finish the quarter smoothly. Every effort should be made to ensure that the activities of proctoring exams, grading exams, and other duties carried out by GSIs and TAs are covered. The following guidance has been developed to assist faculty in addressing issues with the strike.</span></p>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">In order to make arrangements to complete the quarter, please review the following strike preparation information:</span></p>
<h3 class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">1. Communicating with ASEs</span></h3>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">Although the University considers this an unlawful strike inviolation of the ASE&#8217;s collective bargaining agreement, faculty should be aware of potential concerns for striking employees under the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) which governs public-sector, higher education union organizing and activities.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">This wildcat strike is an unlawful activity and ASEs may be subject to discipline, including pay docking and termination, for participating in an illegal strike in violation of their union contract. However, faculty should not unilaterally make determinations about disciplinary action and instead&#160; consult with their chair, who should discuss with their dean, and with labor relations. Additionally, faculty, who are typically considered to be managers and supervisors under HEERA, </span><span class="mp4p">should not</span><span class="mp4p"> engage in any activity which threatens academic student employees, even if they are participating in the grading strike.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<h3 class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">2. Coursework and grades to date</span></h3>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">Consider all previous coursework and grading that included involvement of any ASEs. </span><span class="mp4p">Request that your ASE(s) deliver to you all student work and documents required for course grading as soon as possible. </span><span class="mp4p">Participating graduate students have been asked by strike leaders to remove information related to grading from Canvas, keeping records of their own but not allowing it to be used by instructors of record. Instructors should export a copy of their grade book to ensure they have a copy of information that will allow them to grade. The </span><a class="mp4p" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-16556-4152813654&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1576787117048000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZ2uoAoqGUlg0sQsXKEakh7FDQJw" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-16556-4152813654" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span class="mp4p">Gradebook History</span></a><span class="mp4p"> function in Canvas provides a record of modified grades. Faculty Instructional Technology Center can be reached at <a class="mp4p" target="_blank">canvas.help@ucsc.edu</a>.&#160;</span></p>
<h3 class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">3. Finals week assignments and management</span></h3>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">Consider the specific arrangements of your course to determine what alternative proctoring and assessments may be reasonable. If your final is to be proctored by an ASE, ensure your own availability or the availability of a qualified&#160; backup proctor. If your course requires submission of a final assignment, ensure that collection can occur at a central location without the involvement of an ASE.</span></p>
<h3 class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">4. Grading of final assignments</span></h3>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">In preparing your final assessment, be aware that TAs, readers, and tutors may not be available to assist with grading. To ensure smooth functioning of critical processes such as academic standing review, athletic eligibility, and graduation, grades are due on December 18. Any potential delays should be discussed with your chair or college provost.&#160; </span><span class="mp4p">The Office of the Registrar will provide access to a web form to departments and colleges to enter, by course, any adjusted timelines for submitting final fall grades. The Office of the Registrar will communicate grading delays to colleges reviewing students subject to disqualification based on grades. In specific cases, colleges may follow up with instructors regarding course performance.</span></p>
<h3 class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">5. Final examinations</span></h3>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">Final examinations must be held for courses that are required to hold a final examination. In general, the specific form of a final examination is within the instructor&#8217;s responsibility.</span></p>
<h3 class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">6. Adjustment of course grading</span></h3>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">Some instructors or students may be interested in adjusting how courses are graded, for example using different weightings among categories of student work in the measurement of student achievement of the course&#8217;s learning objectives. Such changes should be considered carefully, but the grading scheme for a course must conform to the parameters of what was approved by the Academic Senate when the course was approved. In addition, any changes should be done in ways that will not disadvantage students in one situation but advantage students in another. Students who see their grade as being arbitrarily impacted by any changes from what was described in the syllabus may wish to follow the informal and formal components of the </span><a class="mp4p" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://senate.ucsc.edu/manual/santacruz-division-manual/part-three-appendices/appendix-c/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1576787117048000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTPdWeFW8HvjyJ90z7KWyPwHmR2A" href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/manual/santacruz-division-manual/part-three-appendices/appendix-c/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span class="mp4p">undergraduate</span></a><span class="mp4p"> or </span><a class="mp4p" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://senate.ucsc.edu/manual/santacruz-division-manual/part-three-appendices/appendix-d/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1576787117048000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF47f9noEISOviHlu27dWlE2LR3BQ" href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/manual/santacruz-division-manual/part-three-appendices/appendix-d/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span class="mp4p">graduate</span></a><span class="mp4p"> grade grievance process.&#160;</span></p>
<h3 class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">5. Discussion with students</span></h3>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">Please review your plans with your students as soon as you are able, in class and by email.</span><span class="mp4p"> The strike will leave some uncertainty for all, so patience should be emphasized as a principle during finals week.&#160;</span></p>
<h3 class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">6. Winter course prerequisites</span></h3>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">Satisfaction of prerequisite courses are not verified until after a final grade has been assigned. Thus, students with missing grades will not be dropped from dependent courses. The final prerequisite check is planned to take place on the Sunday before classes begin.</span></p>
<h3 class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">7. Incomplete Grades</span></h3>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">In accordance with Senate regulations, incomplete grades should only be assigned when individually requested by the student, and when the student has completed work of passing quality, but the student&#8217;s work is not yet complete.</span><span class="mp4p"> An incomplete, as a grade, will cause the student to be dropped from any future courses that require completion of the class as a prerequisite. While advocated by the wildcat strike leaders, incomplete grades should not be assigned unless the normal requirements for assigning an incomplete are met.</span></p>
<h3 class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">8. Specific students on Financial Aid or Academic Probation</span></h3>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">Instructors may be contacted by the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships or a student&#8217;s college concerning specific students in unique situations for determination of student status in the course.&#160; Please do your best to accommodate these requests; any questions or concerns can be directed to FASO Director Patrick Register (</span><a class="mp4p" target="_blank"><span class="mp4p">jpregis@ucsc.edu</span></a><span class="mp4p">) or VPDUE Richard Hughey (<a class="mp4p" target="_blank">rph@ucsc.edu</a>)</span></p>
<h3 class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">Concluding remark</span></h3>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">While a disruptive activity of this kind can significantly impact student learning and the campus as a whole, it is important for the campus, especially for faculty in their dual roles as instructors and managers, to ensure a calm and positive experience for our undergraduate students during this key period of learning and assessment.</span></p>

<p>In the book, Guthman, a professor of social sciences, writes about a confluence of factors unique to the California's strawberry industry that are making the industry's future quite uncertain. Those factors include high up-front costs, labor shortages, increased pesticide regulation, the sky-high cost of coastal acreage, and the impacts of climate change, including hotter and drier conditions. The biggest factor that set the crisis in motion, according to Guthman, was the industry's early embrace of chemical-intensive fumigants to control soil-borne pathogens that cause strawberry plants to wilt and die.&#160;</p>
<p>In announcing their list of the best books and films about the food system, the organization said, "At U.S. Right to Know, we believe that transparency&#8212;in the marketplace and in politics&#8212;is crucial to building a healthier food system for our children, our families and our world. Kudos to the journalists and filmmakers who are exposing how powerful food and chemical industry interests impact our health and the environment."</p>

Coot chicks, however, sport outrageously bright orange and red feathers, skin, and beaks. A new study explains how the bright coloring of coot chicks fits in with the reproductive strategy of their less colorful parents. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Previous research had shown that coot parents preferentially feed the brightly ornamented chicks over those whose plumage has been manipulated to be less colorful, giving the ornamented chicks a survival advantage. This parental preference within families can drive the evolution of ornamentation in the offspring, just as female mate choice can result in ornamented males in the context of sexual selection (peacocks being the classic example of that).</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Left unresolved by the earlier research, however, was why coot parents would have a preference for ornamented chicks in the first place, and whose fitness interests are served by the ornamentation, said Bruce Lyon, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and first author of the new study, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1913615117">published </a></span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1913615117"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>December 30</span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> in </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It&#8217;s an interesting question, because there are theories about conflicts of interest between parents and offspring suggesting that it could be the chick manipulating the parents to get more food,&#8221; Lyon said. &#8220;Having shown that the parents really care about the ornamentation, we focused in this study on the natural variation in chick coloring.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">At their field sites in British Columbia, Lyon and coauthor Daizaburo Shizuka from the University of Nebraska&#8211;Lincoln were already conducting studies that involved collecting eggs from coot nests and hatching them indoors. Using a photospectrometer, they were able to get precise color measurements of almost 1,500 coot chicks. For every chick, they knew the family it came from, the egg laying and hatching order, and in many cases whether or not it was a parasitic egg.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Lyon has spent years studying birds that lay eggs in the nests of other birds. Called brood parasitism, this practice is rampant among coots, with most females laying some eggs in the nests of other coots in addition to laying a clutch in their own nest.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">We thought the parasitic chicks might be more colorful to gain an advantage,&#8221; Lyon said. &#8220;Instead, we found that the parasites are actually less colorful. That was a bit of a shock.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">A key finding came from looking at the chicks' coloring in relation to the order in which they hatched. Coots lay about ten eggs, one per day, and the eggs hatch in the order in which they were laid. It turns out that the later a chick hatches the more colorful it is. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">That tells us the chicks can&#8217;t be controlling their coloration, because they don&#8217;t know where they are in the laying order. This is a maternal effect, presumably due to the mom putting more carotenoid pigments in the later eggs,&#8221; Lyon said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">So why would coot mothers want to mark their chicks in this way? The answer has to do with the American coot&#8217;s brutally harsh reproductive strategy. Coots lay a lot of relatively small eggs, producing more chicks than the food supply can support in most years. As a result, chick mortality is extremely high, with about half of each brood dying of starvation.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It&#8217;s very efficient for coots, because their eggs are not very costly to produce. By laying an optimistic clutch size and then culling the brood to bring it in line with the food supply, they&#8217;re always raising as many chicks as they can,&#8221; Lyon said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The culling takes place mostly during the first ten days after the eggs hatch, when the parents do not show any feeding preferences and feed whichever chick reaches them first when they have food. The first chicks to hatch get a head start on growth, so most of the mortality is among the later hatched chicks. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Everything changes, though, at about ten days after the last chick hatches. At that point, the parents start controlling food allocation to make sure the remaining runts in the brood get enough food to survive. Each parent chooses a favorite who gets preferential feeding, and these favored chicks are the most colorful, later-hatched chicks. Their larger, early-hatched siblings, meanwhile, endure a form of parental aggression called tousling (shaking them by the back of the neck) to keep them from hogging too much food. The favored chicks are initially much smaller than their siblings, but the extra feeding allows them to catch up and sometimes exceed the others in body mass. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The male and female divide up the brood, with each parent exclusively feeding their half of the brood, and each parent also picks a favorite. Color predicts which one they choose, so the ornamentation may serve as a signal to tell them which chick needs the most help,&#8221; Lyon explained. &#8220;They start by creating an uneven playing field, which allows them to cull the brood, and then they intervene to level the field. The orange plumage seems to be a feature that helps them do that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The effect of laying order on coloring also explains why the parasitic eggs are less colorful. The eggs a female lays in a stranger&#8217;s nest are the first ones in her laying sequence, so they get the least pigment. The parasitic egg-laying behavior is opportunistic, so the female may not know when she&#8217;s forming an egg whether she will be laying it in her own nest or someone else&#8217;s. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">They&#8217;re complicated birds. For over 20 years, we&#8217;ve been chipping away at understanding their reproductive behavior, and this is another interesting aspect of that,&#8221; Lyon said. Lyon described parental preferences for ornamented chicks in a 1994 </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Nature</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> paper, and he and Shizuka described coot parents&#8217; food allocation strategies in a 2013 </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Ecology Letters</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> paper.</span></p>
