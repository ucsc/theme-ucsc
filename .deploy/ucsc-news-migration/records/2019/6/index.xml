Her husband, Ken Levy, started a company that supplies quality-control equipment to the semiconductor industry. As young adults, neither of them would have been able to afford college except that City University of New York and Brooklyn College were virtually free in the 1960s. Since finding success in their careers, they&#8217;ve supported education causes because of the meaning they have for them, and because they could afford to.<br/><br/>&#8220;We were both very thankful for the opportunities the education system gave to us,&#8221; Ken Levy says. &#8220;We were two humble kids. We did fine, and we think we need to give back.&#8221;<br/>
<h3>Gravitational lenses and the history of the universe</h3>
The Levys provided a fellowship for Xhakaj&#8217;s graduate work on dark matter halos&#8212;dark matter that envelopes galaxies.<br/><br/>&#8220;Dark matter halos are crucial for understanding the history of the universe as well as the formation and evolution of the galaxies they host,&#8221; says Xhakaj (Ph.D. &#8216;22, astronomy).<br/><br/>Xhakaj estimates their boundaries and density by examining how their gravity changes the appearance of galaxies beyond them. Gravitational &#8220;lensing&#8221; makes more distant galaxies appear squashed into an arc, the way they&#8217;d look through the bottom of a wine glass. <br/><br/>Comparing the boundaries and density of the halos to a computer simulation &#8212;&#8221;I like to say I have the whole universe on my laptop,&#8221; she says&#8212;Xhakaj also estimates how fast the halos gather dark matter from their surroundings. <br/><br/>&#8220;The Levys&#8217; passion for astronomy is wonderful,&#8221; Xhakaj says. &#8220;I wholeheartedly thank them for giving me this chance to live my dream every day.&#8221; <br/><br/>Once she completes her degree, Xhakaj hopes to continue her research and share astronomy with future students.<br/>
<h3>RNA: the &#8220;dark matter&#8221; of biology</h3>
The Levys have become enthusiastic attendees of the Kraw Lectures, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s research showcase in Silicon Valley. At the April 3, 2018 lecture, Dr. Daniel Kim, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering, gave a talk on his lab&#8217;s investigation of a certain kind of RNA that might offer a way to diagnose cancer earlier.<br/><br/>Kim refers to non-coding RNA as the &#8220;dark matter&#8221; of biology because, like the dark matter Xhakaj studies, it is little understood but may play a significant role in development and disease. Specifically, non-coding RNA is made from almost 80% of the 3 billion letters in our genome and dynamically changes in response to cancer-causing mutations in our DNA. From the RNA in a blood sample, Kim aims to discover non-coding RNAs that act as early warning signs of cancer in specific tissues.<br/><br/>Now they are working on technology they hope will help doctors detect this RNA signature of cancer in the blood, which would allow patients to receive treatment at earlier stages, when their cancers are more likely to be cured.<br/><br/>At the Kraw lecture, Kim mentioned to Ken Levy that one of the obstacles to his research is the amount of time he spends applying for federal and foundation grants. The Levys responded with a gift that enables Kim to focus on accelerating the development of his lab's cancer early detection technology.<br/><br/>&#8220;There are currently no early detection methods for many cancers, such as pancreatic cancer&#8221; Kim says. &#8220;We are using the generous support of the Levys to rapidly translate our discoveries from the lab to the clinic.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t his research that interested me as much as the fact he&#8217;s a young professor, he has big ideas, and he&#8217;s trying to perfect them,&#8221; Levy says. &#8221;He&#8217;s bright. He&#8217;s intellectually curious, and he needed some support.&#8221; <br/><br/>The Levys&#8217; gifts promise new discoveries in theoretical cosmology and RNA biology, but Ken Levy emphasizes their goal isn&#8217;t any specific outcome from Xhakaj&#8217;s research or Kim&#8217;s lab.<br/><br/>&#8220;For most of the funds spent looking for new frontiers, the research may not lead to anything,&#8221; Ken Levy says. &#8220;But some will make a breakthrough. You just don&#8217;t know who will do it. Eventually one will, but you have to fund it all.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1e4606898072701734bebd3c055584a1"><name>nuclear-test</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2017 North Korean nuclear test was order of magnitude larger than previous tests</title><summary>A new assessment of the explosion's size was led by UC Santa Cruz seismologist Thorne Lay and undergraduate researcher Dimitri Voytan.</summary><start-date>1559545200000</start-date><display-name>2017 North Korean nuclear test was order of magnitude larger than previous tests</display-name><path>/2019/06/nuclear-test</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/06/nuclear-test</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1559581033312</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1559586768722</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Liza Lester, AGU</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/images/kim-jong-un-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/images/kim-jong-un-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kim-jong-un-410.jpg</name><display-name>kim-jong-un-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>62344</file-size><width>410</width><height>273</height></image><image-alt>North Korean officials</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/images/kim-jong-un-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/images/kim-jong-un-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kim-jong-un-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>kim-jong-un-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16060</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>North Korean officials</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un points to a device with the characteristic two-hemisphere peanut shape of a fusion bomb in an image released by North Korean state media in 2017.

The new assessment of the 2017 explosion&#8217;s size is on the high end of previous estimate ranges.</p>
<p>The new study, led by seismologists at UC Santa Cruz, found that the 2017 test was an order of magnitude larger than the previous five underground tests at North Korea&#8217;s Punggye-ri test site. The researchers took into account the geology of the test site to estimate the size of the explosions from distant seismic recordings of the blasts. They published their findings in the <em><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JB017418">Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</a></em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;From 2006 to 2016 North Korea steadily increased the size of the events, from somewhere around 1 kiloton up to around 20 kilotons. The very early events looked like they didn&#8217;t work very well, because they were unusually small. And then in one year they jumped up to 250-ish kilotons,&#8221; said coauthor Thorne Lay, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;The scary thing is that this was such a big device.&#8221;</p>
<p>North Korea has been testing nuclear devices underground since 2006. The 2017 nuclear test caused a magnitude 6.3 earthquake, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and produced sound waves recorded by seismometers around the world. These reverberations are clues to the size of the blast, but determining the size of the explosion from a distance based on seismic recordings is not simple, said Lay, who has served on the Air Force Technical Application Center Seismic Review Panel tasked with advising on nuclear testing for over 25 years.</p>
<p>Unknown characteristics of the nuclear devices, the test sites, and their geologic context create large uncertainties in estimates of explosion size. Previously published scientific estimates of the 2017 test&#8217;s size have ranged from 30 to 300 kilotons. The U.S. intelligence community has estimated the size of the explosion at 140 kilotons according to a report in <em>The Diplomat</em> magazine.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence typically applies an uncertainty range of a factor of two to reported estimates. A reported yield of 100 kilotons, for example, would include the caveat that it could be as small as 50 kilotons or as large as 200 kilotons. The new research puts the magnitude of the 2017 test in a range of 148 to 328 kilotons.</p>
<p>Steven Gibbons, a geophysicist with the program for Array Seismology and Test-Ban-Treaty Verification at NORSAR and a researcher unaffiliated with the new study, said the new research accurately determines the relative size of the six tests made by North Korea from 2006 to 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the uncertainty the authors quote is quite a realistic range,&#8221; said Gibbons. &#8220;The ratios between the exact numbers are quite accurate, so if the North Koreans told us, for example, that the second test shot in 2016 was exactly 25 kilotons, we could calculate the others accurately from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowing the size of the tests relative to each other is itself useful information, Gibbons said, demonstrating steady progress in North Korea&#8217;s nuclear program.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2006, when there was this little rumble, many people were quite dismissive that North Korea had the technology to do this properly, but I think from the progression we&#8217;ve seen with the increases of yield, it&#8217;s been a very well-executed weapons development program,&#8221; Gibbons said. &#8220;When you got to 2017, there&#8217;s no question that this is an incredibly destructive weapon. Even at the lower end of this uncertain yield, it&#8217;s a horrific weapon.&#8221;</p>
<p>A 250-kiloton explosion could plausibly be produced by either a boosted fission bomb or a modest fusion device, Lay said. The fission bomb detonated at Hiroshima released a blast equivalent to 15 kilotons of TNT by splitting apart atomic nuclei. Fusion devices, also known as thermonuclear or hydrogen bombs, derive their enormous explosive power from combining hydrogen nuclei to form helium and can yield as much as 50,000 kilotons.</p>
<p><strong>Inherent uncertainties</strong></p>
<p>The researchers had information about how sound travels in different types of rock from previous research. &#8220;There are differences, depending on the rock conditions under the test site, in how loud the sound is when you are listening far away,&#8221; Lay said. &#8220;It would be different in granite than in say, sandstone. So we calibrated by setting tests off in our own diverse rock environments and recording right next to the source.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other factors like the depth of the explosion, geometry of the access tunnel, tectonic history of the region, and temperature and fluid content of the rock also influence the rate at which sound waves created by the explosion are dampened, Lay said. Only a tiny amount of the energy generated by the blast is converted to sound and travels away from the test site as seismic waves.</p>
<p>Because of North Korea&#8217;s seclusion, details of the underground geology are not well known. The area experiences very few natural earthquakes that can reveal information about properties of the underlying rock. Researchers used satellite images and other information to estimate the type of rock at the North Korea test site.</p>
<p>The researchers used the explosions from the nuclear tests North Korea conducted beginning in 2006 to calibrate models of how much explosive force transferred to the rock at the test site and how the sound waves traveled through the planet.</p>
<p>The echo of the explosion off the surface of the test site distorts the sound recorded far away. The distortion is affected by the depth and size of the explosion. If the echo were not present, the outgoing sound from the six test explosions would be similar. The researchers used this idea to estimate the relative sizes of the bombs by finding a combination of depth and yield that compensated for the reflection of the sound from the surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve modeled what the reflection would look like for different yields and depths and solved for what the signal would look like if you didn&#8217;t have to account for this returning wave. The most impressive thing in the paper for me is how similar these waveforms are. This is what gives me confidence that they&#8217;ve done a good job,&#8221; Gibbons said.</p>
<p><strong>Rebooting Cold War strategies</strong></p>
<p>The new study revived modeling strategies developed in the early 1980s to resolve suspicions that the Soviet Union had cheated on the Treaty on the Limitation of Underground Nuclear Weapon Tests by testing bombs larger than the 150-kiloton size threshold for testing they agreed to in 1974.</p>
<p>The treaty had been signed but not ratified by the U.S. Senate. The Reagan Administration publicly aired intelligence concerns that Russian tests exceeded the size threshold, because observed sound waves produced by the tests were bigger than known test shots at the U.S.&#8217;s Nevada test site.</p>
<p>But seismologists believed the signals from the Soviet tests were bigger because they transmitted through the earth more efficiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mantle under the Nevada test site is very hot and has processes that dampen down the sound. It is very different from the former Soviet test site in Kazakhstan, where the rock under the test site is old and cold and transmits sound very efficiently, without much loss,&#8221; Lay said.</p>
<p>During negotiations for the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, U.S. and Soviet scientists travelled to the test sites in Nevada and Kazakhstan and conducted joint tests. Measurements at the test sites confirmed geologists&#8217; methods for estimating the extra dampening effect in Nevada compared to the Soviet test site.</p>
<p>The new study applied some of the same methods validated in the 1980s to the North Korean tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;The methods were nothing particularly new. The difference is that the quality and availability of the data is much better now than 40 years ago,&#8221; Lay said.</p>
<p>Gibbons said the new study&#8217;s results are likely as close as scientists outside North Korea could get to the true size of the nuclear tests without data from the test sites. &#8220;I think the authors have pushed it to the limits with this paper.

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This </span><a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/awards/student-awards/zimmerman/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scholarship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was established to honor Gabriel "Gabe" Zimmerman, the alum who was shot and killed in the 2011 attack on Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Zimmerman was working as Giffords' community outreach director at a constituent-engagement event he had organized when gunshots rang out; he ran towards Giffords, who was gravely wounded in the assassination attempt. Gabe was killed. The scholarship was established in the weeks after the shooting by UC Santa Cruz graduates Jonathan Klein (Merrill '89, politics) and Alex Clemens (Porter '89, international politics) and has since attracted support from more than 520 donors. It supports undergraduates who are passionate about social issues and committed to social service.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That morning, Bookshop had a ribbon-cutting ceremony and grand opening for its brand-new UC Santa Cruz Slug Shop, which now hosts a thoughtfully curated collection of UC Santa Cruz-themed clothing, keychains, books, reusable water bottles and beer glasses and Sammy the Slug memorabilia, and will also serve as headquarters for UC Santa Cruz/Bookshop Santa Cruz partnerships.&#160;The celebration included more than 30 well-wishers and many local VIPS, including Sammy the Slug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some high-profile events are already in the works, including a talk by bestselling writer Malcolm Gladwell on September 21 in Redwood City. UC Santa Cruz with Bookshop Santa Cruz is hosting the talk. (The event will soon be listed at <a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/">events.ucsc.edu</a>)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bookshop Santa Cruz owner Casey Coonerty-Protti said that it was only a matter of time before two of Santa Cruz&#8217;s best-known and most influential institutions joined forces. After all, the bookstore and university have had a longstanding cordial and synergistic relationship. Even their birthdays fall close together: UC Santa Cruz opened its doors to students in 1965, while Bookshop has been around since 1966.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from that, the two institutions share similar missions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bookshop is dedicated to the idea of the written word and being a catalyst for intellectual and cultural life, and so is the university,&#8221; Coonerty-Protti said. &#8220;So many customers are alumni, and a lot of our staff are, too. There has always been a strong connection. We have the same shared values. Bookshop is Santa Cruz&#8217;s living room, and it just made sense for UC Santa Cruz to be represented here. And there is just limitless potential to cosponsor events.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took a couple of years to turn the dream of a Slug Shop into fruition, Coonerty-Protti said. To make way for this store-within-a-store, which occupies a large chunk of the front section of Bookshop, near the windows facing Pacific Avenue, the bookstore&#8217;s staff had to move the magazine department as well as some offices. The store also had to order merchandise and come up with a vision for the layout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ribbon-cutting VIP crew that showed up to Bookshop spoke to the nature of the town-gown partnership that made the Slug Shop possible. Among the ribbon cutters were Coonerty-Protti; her brother and third-district supervisor Ryan Coonerty, who is also a politics lecturer on campus; and their father Neal Coonerty, Bookshop&#8217;s original owner and a former third-district supervisor. Also in attendance were UC Santa Cruz mascot Sammy the Slug; Santa Cruz Mayor Martine Watkins (Oakes &#8216;02, legal studies); UC Santa Cruz Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services Sarah Latham; and Chip, executive director of the Downtown Association. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latham, looking around the store, said it was clear that &#8220;two years working and thinking over hot chocolate and coffee&#8221; had paid off. &#8220;It is such an honor to be able to partner with such a beloved business and a family that has done so much for Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neal Coonerty added to the festivities by circulating throughout the Slug Shop, offering guests a plate of tasty Banana Slug cookies from the Buttery Bakery in Santa Cruz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coonerty-Protti had special thanks for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Bay Tree Bookstore; Bookshop staffers Sara McCleod, Nicole Galante, and Sheila Cremini; the Downtown Association; UC Santa Cruz Communications and Marketing; as well as Watkins and Ryan Coonerty, for helping to make the store a reality. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="23346d9d8072701734bebd3c5f8876cb"><name>planned-power-outages</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Planned power outage on June 22 and Dec. 26-30   </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz will have a planned power outage from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on June 22 as part of the solar parking canopy project in the East Remove Parking Lot.

"What is interesting is that adults of this species look nothing like this whale," said UCSC biologist Robin Dunkin. "It turns out that this was a very young animal, probably less than a year old. Once it reaches sexual maturity, it changes color, grows two teeth, and is much bigger than this whale."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Scientists from UC Santa Cruz's Long Marine Laboratory responded to a whale stranding at Scott Creek Beach near Davenport on Friday, May 31, and discovered that the animal was an extremely rare Perrin's beaked whale.</p>
<p>The stranded whale was alive but badly injured and had to be euthanized on the beach. A post-mortem examination (or "necropsy") was performed over the weekend by scientists from UC Santa Cruz and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW).</p>
<p>Beaked whales, of which there are 23 known species, are elusive, deep-diving whales that have not been well studied. Perrin's beaked whale was only recognized as a separate species in 2002, and only a few specimens have ever been examined. The one stranded at Scott Creek Beach was a male about about 8.75 feet long and weighed about 500 pounds.</p>
<p>"This is only the seventh individual to have been examined, so it's a rare opportunity. We collected hundreds of samples for researchers here and across the world, and the entire skeleton will be going to the California Academy of Sciences," said Robin Dunkin, teaching professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and director of the <a href="https://lmlstrandingnetwork.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Long Marine Lab Marine Mammal Stranding Network</a>.</p>
<p>Dunkin and CDFW veterinary pathologist Melissa Miller performed the necropsy with assistance from UCSC and CDFW staff. They found that the whale had a fractured rostrum, the elongated "beak" formed by its jawbones. Both the upper and lower jawbones were broken, but it was not clear how that had happened, Dunkin said.</p>
<p>"We have three hypotheses: The first would be a boat strike, and the second is another animal ramming it. The third possibility is it could have somehow run into the bottom or a rock outcropping while it was pursuing prey," she said. "The pathology samples will help us tell how long ago the injury was sustained."</p>
<p>Beaked whales in general are often involved in mass strandings and appear to be especially sensitive to disturbance by naval sonar. They are the deepest diving marine mammals, regularly descending to depths over 1,000 meters (3,300 feet). They feed on squid and other deep-water prey, using sonar to locate their prey.</p>
<p>Baird's beaked whales, a more common species, have been spotted in Monterey Bay within the past week, Dunkin said, so the team was surprised to discover that the stranded whale belonged to this very rare species. Perrin's beaked whale was described as a new species in 2002 on the basis of five animals that had stranded on the California coast between 1975 and 1997 and were initially identified as other species.</p>
<p>"This really highlights the importance of the marine mammal stranding network in not only responding to the more common strandings of animals like sea lions, but also being there when something rare like this happens," Dunkin said.</p>
<p>Because the beaked whale was alive when it stranded, the team was able to recover very fresh tissue samples, which will be especially useful for researchers. Dunkin said she expects the samples collected from this animal will be used by researchers for decades to come. Scientists are particularly interested in studying the whale's brain and the anatomy of its auditory system, she said.</p>
<p>A team of about a dozen staff, students, and volunteers helped Dunkin and UCSC campus veterinarian David Casper respond to the stranded whale. Casper consulted with rehabilitation experts at the <a href="http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/">Marine Mammal Center</a> in Sausalito before deciding to euthanize the injured animal. UCSC stranding technicians Karolina Wirga and Amber Diluzio and CDFW laboratory technician Erin Dodd assisted with the recovery and necropsy.</p>
<p>The Long Marine Lab Marine Mammal Stranding Network has been in operation for over 30 years, responding to reports of stranded animals in Santa Cruz County and, in cooperation with Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, in Monterey County as well. The nation's stranding networks, authorized by NOAA to respond to live and dead marine mammals that come ashore on U.S. beaches, make vital contributions to scientific research and conservation of marine mammals. The Long Marine Lab Stranding Network receives funding from NOAA's John H. Prescott Program, which supports stranding networks nationally.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2995ec2c8072701734bebd3c0fd1afc4"><name>commencement-preview</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus prepping for commencement ceremonies</title><summary>More than 5,200 UCSC students are earning undergraduate and graduate degrees for work completed during the 2018–19 academic year.

In addition, TAPS will implement ParkMobile, a mobile-app pay option, to begin the transition away from coins and ParkCards at metered spaces. ParkMobile will only replace coins and ParkCards at the current coin-operated meters; this will not affect PayStation spaces.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the coming days, you will notice some new green decals on the meters providing instructions on how to pay for parking at that space. The presence of these decals means the system is live and ready to go!&#160; If you use metered spaces, download the ParkMobile app ahead of time to get ready for the transition.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The ParkMobile app is easy to use:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://parkmobile.app.link/SYLSYDYShR">Download the ParkMobile app</a> on your smartphone and register for an account.</li>
<li>When at a ParkMobile enabled space, open the app and enter the zone number indicated on the decal or sign, along with your vehicle&#8217;s license plate number.</li>
<li>Parking Enforcement will be able to verify payment and expiration times based on your vehicle license plate number.</li>
<li>Follow the payment prompts.</li>
<li>Rest easy knowing your parking is paid for &#8212; no need to find coins in the cup holder or recharge your ParkCard.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Don&#8217;t have a smartphone? Call the toll-free number displayed on the decal or sign to pay by credit card over the phone.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>The ParkMobile app will permit your vehicle to stay parked for only the maximum time limit. You cannot extend past this time in the app unless you leave the parking area (zone) for a duration equivalent to the maximum time limit. For example, if you pay and park for the maximum time in a two-hour zone, you cannot start a new parking transaction in this zone for another two hours. This way, more of the campus population can benefit from short-term on-demand parking.</div>

They attend the 2-unit seminar, <em>Leadership and Institution Building</em>, with the chancellor and other administrators. Interns receive an $8,000 stipend, covering the cost of their student fees for the year.<br/>
<h3>A chance to make things better</h3>
Gabrielle Magee co-led a team at the African American Resource and Cultural Center that aimed to make a more welcoming campus environment for marginalized communities. She trained a team of facilitators and convened discussions to raise awareness of topics like microaggressions and anti-blackness. <br/><br/>&#8220;This project and the CUIP program helped me believe in the work I produce,&#8221; said Magee (Kresge &#8216;20, psychology). &#8220;From the feedback we received, the work we were doing was life-changing for some people.&#8221;<br/><br/>Through her internship with the First Generation Initiative, Christina Yu built a website for parents and guardians who have not attended college. The project included recruiting fellow first-generation students to give advice and record interviews with their own parents. <br/><br/>&#8220;Few resources are available for parents and guardians of first-gen students,&#8221; said Yu (College Ten &#8216;20, cognitive science). &#8220;The interviews give insights to parents and reassure them that their child will be OK.&#8221;<br/><br/>Some observers of the event noticed themselves experiencing strong reactions. <br/><br/>"I found looking over the posters an emotionally charged experience,&#8221; said Todd Thorpe, instructor of the leadership seminar. &#8220;These young women and men are doing such important work and are so earnest and sincere. It is very humbling to see such dedication."<br/>
<h3>The chancellor&#8217;s legacy</h3>
Program graduates take away job skills along with accomplishments related to their UC Santa Cruz studies&#8212;advantageous experience as they make the first steps in their careers. <br/><br/>It is the largest beneficiary of the <a href="https://giving.ucsc.edu/giving-opportunities/ucsc-fund/">UCSC Fund</a>, the university&#8217;s main fund for general donations. An increase in gifts enabled the program to grow from 35 interns last year to its current size. At the poster presentation, Chancellor George R. Blumenthal announced that CUIP would continue to support 50 interns in the next school year.<br/><br/>As he congratulated the interns on their presentations, he noted that their projects all contributed lasting benefits to the campus.<br/><br/>&#8220;I think of this program as the definition of symbiosis,&#8221; said Blumenthal, who is retiring at the end of the month after 13 years as chancellor and 47 years on campus. &#8220;You benefit, and the campus benefits. It&#8217;s a win-win.&#8221;<br/><br/>The program has been a priority for Blumenthal, and an endowment in his name providing permanent funding was announced at his retirement celebration June 1. <br/><br/><em>To contribute, go to the <a href="https://giving.ucsc.edu/support/honoring-blumenthal/">George R.

<p>While his parents didn&#8217;t attend themselves, they stressed the importance of a college education, taking him and his sisters to visit several campuses around California. &#8220;It was not about if I wanted to go to college but what school I would go to,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This month, the 22-year-old graduates from UC Santa Cruz with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in legal studies and Latin American and Latino studies. He credits his parents for making it happen. &#8220;I really do owe them all my success,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Born in Mexico, Arroyo De La Paz moved to the U.S. with his family when he was 3. The family settled in Victorville in San Bernardino County where his father eventually got a job as a factory worker and his mother stayed home to look after their three children.</p>
<p>Arroyo De La Paz entered the university in fall 2015. He chose the campus over a couple of other options in the University of California system because of the financial aid and the appealing setting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a kid from the desert, I did like the idea of moving to the forest and being close to the ocean,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was calling my name.&#8221;</p>
<p>His most memorable courses tackled the broad themes of justice and human rights.</p>
<p>He liked <em>Comparative Law</em> because it was taught by Jacqueline Gehring, who is very funny and engaging, and because it compared legal systems all over the world. &#8220;It was very informative and very mind opening,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He loved <em>Race and Ethnicity</em> because it explored the racism within communities of color and the reality experienced by indigenous and black communities in Latin America.</p>
<p>Arroyo De La Paz also loved being able to escape to the beach whenever the stress of school got too much. He and his friends would head to West Cliff Drive and look at the waves or go to the boardwalk, buy wristbands, and enjoy all the carnival rides.</p>
<p>A more recent highlight of his college experience has been participating in the UCDC program in Washington, D.C. He is wrapping up a quarter there and has joined other students from other University of California campuses in studying and living together and pursuing internships. He completed two internships&#8212;one at an immigration law firm and another at the Capitol.</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a beautiful city&#8212;it might be my favorite that I&#8217;ve been to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, he&#8217;s looking forward to returning to California and reuniting with his family. After graduation, he plans to take some time off from school and get a job perhaps working at another immigration law firm or as a counselor or adviser at a university.</p>
<p>But eventually, he plans to apply to law school and study immigration law.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to do this to be able to help out people that have gone through the same struggles as me and my family,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Arroyo De La Paz said he is so grateful for all the help his parents gave him with school despite their language barrier. They did the best they could to help him navigate the application process even though they had no experience with it.</p>
<p>They also provided him with good examples of how to work hard. &#8220;It is an example of the American dream,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They left their country because there weren&#8217;t any job opportunities, the economy was really bad, there was violence and it was not livable. They had the courage to come to the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>His younger sister recently graduated from high school and is also planning to start college in the fall. She will be attending Harvard University.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/images/hector-profile-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/images/hector-profile-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hector-profile-featured.jpg</name><file-size>36031</file-size><width>500</width><height>240</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Hector Arroyo De La Paz</thumb-alt><title>Student to pursue career helping immigrants</title><description>First-generation college student Hector Arroyo De La Paz just graduated from UC Santa Cruz next week with a bachelor’s degree in legal studies and Latin American and Latino studies.

<p>De la Espriella gathered and analyzed soil samples from redwood forests as part of her investigation of the ecological significance of coastal redwoods, the iconic trees that grow only from Big Sur to southern Oregon.</p>
<p>"People love redwoods&#8212;we call them charismatic megaflora. They're like the polar bears of plants," she said. "They give you a sense of awe."</p>
<p>Forests play a critical role in mitigating the effects of climate change; trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow, storing the carbon in their wood. Because they are so massive and long-lived, redwoods store significant amounts of carbon in their trunks, leaves, and branches for hundreds of years, or more. They also contribute to the amount of carbon stored in the soil as organic matter. De la Espriella's project looked at soil carbon content in redwood forests across the state.</p>
<p>"I wanted to emphasize the importance of natural spaces," said de la Espriella. "Setting aside wild spaces and respecting nature is so important, but it's hard to make a case for conservation. How do you communicate the importance of wild spaces in a contemporary way? Climate change is exacerbated by deforestation."</p>
<p>De la Espriella took soil samples from 10 different forests located across the redwoods' range, utilizing the UC Santa Cruz Natural Reserves on campus and at Big Creek to practice her sampling methods. By measuring the soil-carbon content, she hoped to identify the habitats in which redwoods sequester the most carbon. Temperature, rainfall, and latitude all influence the rate of decomposition of soil organic matter. De la Espriella was surprised to find that rainfall and latitude had greater impact on soil carbon than did temperature.</p>
<p>"I found lower levels of soil carbon in the rainier, more northern sites," she said, hypothesizing that higher decomposition and mineralization activity reduced the availability of carbon in the soil. She also took some of her samples immediately after major floods, which she suspects may have skewed her results.</p>
<p>"I'd like to repeat the study and take samples in winter, spring, summer, and fall," she said, acknowledging what every scientist comes to learn: Each experiment yields some answers&#8212;and more questions.</p>
<p>"What I learned was six months was not as much time as I thought it would be!" she said, adding that her determination to work independently also limited the scope of what she was able to accomplish. "Having more time and more hands would've really helped.&#160;</p>
<p><em>Getting the most out of college</em></p>
<p>De la Espriella conducted the experiment to satisfy the Environmental Studies Department's <a href="https://envs.ucsc.edu/undergraduate/prog-reqs/seniorcomp.html">senior exit requirement</a>.</p>
<p>"It was an opportunity to do something on my own that I create," she said, explaining why she chose to do original research.</p>
<p>De la Espriella, who is 26, arrived at UC Santa Cruz as a junior transfer, having taken classes at Cabrillo College and a community college in Florida, where she grew up. She discovered the natural world after high school, but said, "People thought I was weird for liking nature."</p>
<p>The natural beauty of UC Santa Cruz appealed to her, and when she visited the campus, she knew she would no longer be an outcast. "I told myself, 'I'm going to learn from people here,' " recalled de la Espriella.</p>
<p>Environmental Studies Professor Michael Loik, her adviser on the redwoods project, is one of the people she learned from. Her project was quite ambitious, involving hundreds of miles of travel to collect a total of 120 soil samples from 10 different sites: six state parks, two UC natural reserves, and two sites owned by land trusts. De la Espriella reached out to the Sempervirens Fund and the Land Trust of Santa Cruz County to get access to their properties, and she had to secure research permits from California State Parks. She began talking to Loik about the project last fall and started applying for grants in December to cover travel costs, supplies, and lab time; analyzing soil samples in the stable isotope lab on campus cost $11 each.</p>
<p>"We're fortunate that we are able to give out a handful of financial awards for this sort of project," said Loik, who encourages students to do hands-on research. "It's a springboard for graduate school and careers for a lot of our students. They get skills they can use in future careers with the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, or consulting."</p>
<p>De la Espriella, who is graduating this month, has "made great use of these opportunities," Loik said, noting that she has also been proactive about outreach and sharing her experiences on a <a href="https://openexplorer.nationalgeographic.com/expedition/redwoods/">National Geographic blog</a>.</p>
<p>De la Espriella was first exposed to hands-on research during UC's system-wide field course on <a href="https://ucnrs.org/teaching/cec/">California Ecology and Conservation</a>, a rigorous, quarter-long class she took last fall. Students tour the state visiting UC natural reserves in the desert, the Sierra, redwood forests, and elsewhere, conducting short experiments in each spot.</p>
<p>"It was an amazing experience. They really train you," said de la Espriella. "I was learning by doing. It was what everyone says education should be. It was hard to sit in a classroom after that."</p>
<p>De la Espriella's go-for-it approach to her education was evident in her participation as the only undergraduate who presented her research during the campus's recent annual <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/03/kapuscinski-climate.html">Climate Conference</a>. For the first time, students were invited to share research findings during an informal program that followed the panel discussion. She was the only undergraduate who approached the organizers about participating.</p>
<p>"It was great, because I got training in how to communicate about science," she said. "A lot of undergraduates came up to me wanting to know how I did this. Doing my own research was a big part of making my experience here what I wanted it to be. Having that autonomy was valuable to me. It can be scary, but I think that's where you grow."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="341d9f2f8072701734bebd3ce4ef76ed"><name>fukurai-argentina</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Juries bring transparency and accountability to trials in Argentina</title><summary>A trial by one's peers is a pillar of democracy, which is why scholars and activists are celebrating Argentina's budding embrace of jury trials.</summary><keywords>jury, trial, democracy, argentina, fukurai</keywords><start-date>1559890800000</start-date><display-name>Fukurai-Argentina</display-name><path>/2019/06/fukurai-argentina</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/06/fukurai-argentina</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1559947484176</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1560184405751</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/fukurai-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/fukurai-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fukurai-400.jpg</name><display-name>fukurai-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>45793</file-size><width>400</width><height>273</height></image><image-alt>Hiroshi Fukurai</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/fukurai-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/fukurai-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fukurai-80.jpg</name><display-name>fukurai-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>8332</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Hiroshi Fukurai</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>"Jury trials give people power against tyrannical structures," says Hiroshi Fukurai, who was one of four international experts invited to a recent conference in Argentina.

<p>So far, two jurisdictions have transitioned from bench trials, in which judges decide cases alone, to jury trials. Both stipulated that their juries must be made up of equal numbers of men and women, and the province of Neuqu&#233;n went further by also requiring that half the jurors be members of local indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Hiroshi Fukurai, a professor of sociology and an international expert on jury systems, is encouraged by what's happening in Argentina, and he is hopeful that the trend will continue in Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and elsewhere. Bearing the scars of brutal military dictatorships, "dirty wars," and the covert influence of the United States, many Latin America countries are exploring jury trials as a way to empower citizens, he said.</p>
<p>"Jury trials give people power against tyrannical structures," said Fukurai, who was one of four experts invited to a recent conference in Argentina. There, scholars, activists, and representatives of Argentina's 23 provinces gathered to take stock of progress and discuss ways to bring greater transparency to the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>In Argentina, tens of thousands of people disappeared or were murdered during the government's brutal "Dirty War," which took place from 1976 to 1983. "The government held secret trials, and people were convicted and executed&#8212;some even without a trial," said Fukurai, noting that judges lacked oversight or accountability and were free to base decisions on forced confessions.</p>
<p>Two organizations played key roles lobbying for the creation of a "lay" jury system that "puts ordinary people in the position of making legal decisions whether the accused is guilty or not." Although the Argentine constitution has guaranteed jury trials since 1853, they were not actually introduced until 2006, when the state of Cordoba adopted a "mixed tribunal" system that offers a combination of professional judges and lay jurors. Fukurai called it an "experiment," which was followed in 2017 by the province of <span>Neuqu&#233;n</span> and the capital city of Buenos Aires, which is an autonomous jurisdiction, adopting the U.S.-style all-citizen jury trial system. Unlike the United States, where the Supreme Court has forbidden the use of quotas on juries, Argentinian provinces can, and have, mandated the make-up of juries</p>
<p>"Neuqu&#233;n has the largest indigenous population in Argentina," said Fukurai. "Many people live off the land, and their ancestral lands are important for their survival. There's tremendous biological diversity."</p>
<p>But ecologically unsustainable projects, including mining by international conglomerates, has degraded the landscape, spoiled water and soil, and left a legacy of toxic residue. Under the traditional bench-trial system, more than 100 indigenous activists were vilified as terrorists, arrested, and imprisoned for protesting corporate development of their ancestral lands, said Fukurai. Since the introduction of jury trials, that unfair prosecution has been deterred, he said.</p>
<p>"Terrorism was being used as a pretext in the past to arrest indigenous activists and collaborating white environmentalists and put them in jail," said Fukurai.</p>
<p>In Argentina, where provinces have autonomous criminal justice systems, legal scholars and advocates are hopeful more provinces will follow in the footsteps of Neuqu&#233;n and Buenos Aires; at this point, four provinces have proposed the change, and five more are considering it. Fukurai, who was invited to the conference to share his expertise in the jury systems of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China, said the goal is to see jury trials adopted throughout South America, where the struggle for democratic freedoms is ongoing.</p>
<p>"There were military dictatorships and dirty wars throughout South America," he said. "With emerging democratic movements in the 1980s and 1990s, Argentina became more democratic, but now it is trending away, the same as Venezuela."</p>
<p>As economic pressures increase, fueled in part by the influence of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, governments across the continent are forced to adopt austerity measures, such as making cuts to pensions, health care, education, and social spending, he said. Anticipating growing social tension, democratic activists want to see jury trials adopted more broadly&#8212;extended to civil cases, not just criminal, according to Fukurai.</p>
<p>"Civil law is where people go for redress when the state harms the interests of the people&#8212;things like environmental destruction and pollution," he said. "People can fight their local government through litigation."</p>
<p>The introduction of jury trials in Argentina has made the news in that country, but it has received little attention elsewhere, beyond scholarly circles.</p>
<p>"The jury system is about people having the power to make decisions about their lives in their own communities," said Fukurai, who has studied juries for 35 years. He is the president of the Asian Law and Society Association, and is the author of <a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780306441448"><em>Race and the Jury</em></a>, <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/book/4721"><em>Race in the Jury Box</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/japan-and-civil-jury-trials"><em>Japan and Civil Jury Trials</em></a>. He noted that prominent French jurist Alexis de Tocqueville once said U.S. democracy was based on two things: the electoral system and jury service.</p>
<p>"Democracy cannot rest," said Fukurai. "Even though Argentina has achieved what other countries haven't, they are getting pushback. You have to always fight to maintain and educate people about democratic ideals."</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking up at the night sky through an astrophotography telescope, he was amazed to see pulses of bright light from distant supernovae.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, all those years of passion, curiosity, problem-solving, and determination are paying off. Wong, who goes by the first name &#8220;Sunny,&#8221; is this year&#8217;s winner of the Steck Family Award, honoring the most outstanding senior research project chosen from 15 projects that have already won the highly prestigious Chancellor Award. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel very honored,&#8221; Wong said, adding that it was especially gratifying to get such strong validation from his project mentors, UC Santa Cruz Professor and Chair of Astronomy and Astrophysics Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz and Postdoctoral Scholar Josiah Schwab, a Hubble Fellow at UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to get their recognition because they are both very great mentors and very respectable scientists,&#8221; Wong said. &#8220;Enrico has always been pushing me toward being a better scientist in communicating my work well and trying to make sure there is a clear message brought out in my paper.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wong will receive bound copies of his thesis to share with family and friends and a $1,000 honorarium. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same supernovae that so entranced Wong during his childhood served as his thesis subject matter. To be more specific, Wong studied the conditions that cause white dwarf stars to burst into thermonuclear supernovae. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White dwarfs are the celestial bodies that are left behind when stars begin to die. Normally, these enormous cosmic cinders merely dim and cool, but a few of these white dwarfs grow by stealing the mass of nearby &#8220;companion&#8217;&#8217; stars. These white dwarfs, which have the mass of the sun and are roughly the same size as planet Earth, grow and grow until they reach a critical mass, starting a carbon-fusion reaction in their centers and blowing themselves up in bright and powerful supernovae. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwab said these supernovae are of special interest to astrophysicists because these bright explosions are &#8220;cosmic beacons&#8221; that help scientists measure intergalactic distances and develop a better understanding of the cosmos, including the Nobel Prize&#8211;winning discovery that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. To research his thesis, Wong used UC Santa Cruz supercomputers to simulate hundreds of combinations of white dwarfs and stars at different distances and masses, looking to find out which pairings would result in cataclysmic events. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end result was a thesis that greatly impressed Ramirez-Ruiz and Schwab. Then again, Wong showed tremendous potential even before completing his celebrated thesis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Usually, only 1 percent of undergraduates in physics contribute to first-author papers, and Sunny did this in the fastest time I have seen an undergraduate do it,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz said. &#8220;Now he&#8217;s working on a second one. His determination and grit, and also brilliance, is unlike anything I&#8217;ve seen before.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loren Steck (Porter &#8217;73), whose family created the award, said every one of this year&#8217;s finalists did incredible work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You guys are amazing!&#8221; he gushed. &#8220;I did a couple of theses at UC Santa Cruz, and I know how hard they are and how important they can be for your careers.&#8221; He said their sterling work also speaks to the enormous importance of these students&#8217; mentors, who guided and supported their projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wong will soon head to UC Santa Barbara for graduate work in astrophysics, but for now, he is savoring the moment. Among the people who are singing his praises are his mother and father in Hong Kong. Neither parent comes from a science background. His father is a correctional officer and his mother a nurse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think they&#8217;re proud of me,&#8221; he said with a smile. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3fa66e018072701734bebd3c1d7095bb"><name>teaching-awards-luncheon</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Awards recognize extraordinary teachers</title><summary>The annual Excellence in Teaching Awards recognized seven exceptional instructors who were selected from more than 430 nominations. </summary><start-date>1560063600000</start-date><display-name>Teaching awards</display-name><path>/2019/06/teaching-awards-luncheon</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/06/teaching-awards-luncheon</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1560140999372</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1560288982974</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Arts</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/images/teaching-awards-250px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/images/teaching-awards-250px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>teaching-awards-250px.jpg</name><display-name>teaching-awards-250px.jpg</display-name><file-size>18423</file-size><width>250</width><height>150</height></image><image-alt>Teaching awards on table</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/images/teaching-awards-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/images/teaching-awards-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>teaching-awards-80px.jpg</name><display-name>teaching-awards-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>8188</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Teaching awards on table</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz celebrated its innovative and dedicated teachers with the 2019 Excellence in Teaching Awards.</p>
<p>The awards were given out by Chancellor George Blumenthal on June 7 during a luncheon at University Center. Blumenthal noted that the seven recipients this year were selected from 430 nominations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your caring, your commitment to teaching, your compassion for students is recognized and appreciated,&#8221; Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s recipients are:</p>
<h3>Noriko Aso, associate professor, History Department</h3>
<p>Aso uses a horizontal approach in her teaching, meeting her students where they are as a way of supporting their intellectual and scholarly development.</p>
<p>Additionally, she continuously engages with nontraditional pedagogies and assignments. For example, experimenting with silent discussions and focusing on collaborative approaches to learning both in undergraduate and graduate courses.</p>
<p>A student nominator wrote, &#8220;Professor Aso employs an insane amount of teaching activities that we try out in her classroom to gauge their fit. She truly is on the cutting edge of pedagogical best practices and universal design for learning.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Nat Berman, lecturer, Music Department</h3>
<p>Nat Berman, who earned undergraduate and graduate degrees at UCSC, continues his devotion to campus through teaching of the concert choir and wind ensemble.</p>
<p>With patience and vision, he leads the choir, which has very few music majors in it, to extraordinary levels. Berman believes that every student, whether a music major or not, should finish his courses with an improved sense of musicianship, technique, and creative artistry.</p>
<p>A student nominator called Nat &#8220;one of the most thoughtful, motivated, and engaging professors I&#8217;ve had the privilege of studying under.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Rebecca Covarrubias, assistant professor, Psychology Department</h3>
<p>Since her 2015 arrival to campus, Rebecca Covarrubias&#8217;s teaching commitment focuses on re-centering the voice and experiences of marginalized students to support, engage and support their success.</p>
<p>Her teaching seeks to address conventional research methodologies in psychology to re-imagine how research can be used as a tool for social justice and for resisting social inequities.</p>
<p>Students praises her teaching for her &#8220;engagement and passion for the material&#8221; while allowing her students to &#8220;challenge, question and and share [their] thoughts.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Robin Dunkin, assistant teaching professor, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department</h3>
<p>Robin Dunkin&#8217;s active learning course moves away from classic approaches, offering students a diversity of ways to demonstrate their mastery of concepts, often allowing projects and smaller assignments.</p>
<p>Students note that Dunkin keeps up with current pedagogy research and designs her teaching around that. In class, students use white boards and do partner work. They also are given daily videos to watch outside of class.</p>
<p>Additionally, Dunkin serves as a mentor and models leadership to and for her students.</p>
<h3>Sean Keilen, professor, Literature Department</h3>
<p>Sean Keilen&#8217;s ability to teach across the curriculum in literature reflects his intellectual and pedagogical skills.</p>
<p>He teaches lower division undergraduate courses as well as graduate seminars. His enthusiasm for the materials coupled with his support for student intellectual discovery is noted by many of those who nominated him.</p>
<p>Students say he has clear expertise in his field, and is adept at weaving student opinions into his discussions of a novel.</p>
<h3>Adam Millard-Ball, associate professor, Environmental Studies Department</h3>
<p>Adam Millard-Ball is described as creative, dedicated, effective, charismatic, and caring in his approach to teaching. He integrates experiential learning into all of his courses, encouraging his students to have real-world impact.</p>
<p>His teaching work engagement with students is to show how to be civically engaged to help mitigate problems of environmental injustice and climate change.</p>
<p>A student remarked, "He practices patience, inclusivity, and variety in his teaching which is unmatched by any other professor I have had. Dr. Millard-Ball has always taken steps to build a relationship with all his students and pays particular attention to each individual&#8217;s learning needs. He uses gentle yet motivating encouragement which I believe has transformed me from a high school student to a college student."</p>
<h3>Shelley Stamp, professor, Film and Digital Media Department</h3>
<p>Shelley Stamp&#8217;s teaching encompasses movie culture, critical analysis and public engagement.</p>
<p>These teaching strategies make her courses dynamic, whether it be a large lecture course or a small senior seminar.</p>
<p>Colleagues speak of the consistently glowing reviews of her classes from all of her students&#8212;undergrads or Ph.Ds. Student nominators called Stamp an amazing lecturer who makes difficult topics easy to understand as well as interesting.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="43676a7e8072701734bebd3cbaa79f16"><name>mumps-information</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Information about mumps</title><summary>We want to help you understand and protect yourself against mumps.

Recently, we have had one confirmed cases of mumps, one probable case of mumps on Campus and three suspected cases of mumps.</p>
<p>Mumps can be serious, but most people recover completely within two weeks without complications. The disease typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Within the first two days of these initial symptoms, most people will develop swelling of their salivary glands (the glands that make saliva), causing puffy cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw. Rarely, mumps can cause other, more serious complications. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p>
<p>Two Measles Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccines provides lifelong immunity against mumps for 88% of people. This means that the vaccine is not effective for every person. A small number of people who had two MMR vaccines and are exposed to mumps may still develop the disease. Once a person is exposed to mumps, there is no medicine to prevent or clear the disease because it is a virus. For most people, mumps illness is brief and causes no major consequences. To learn more about mumps visit: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/features/mumps/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/features/mumps/index.html</a></p>
<p>Mumps is spread via respiratory droplets and requires close physical contact between people. Close physical contact means activities like kissing, sharing drinks, sexual partners and close physical contact during sports.&#160;&#160; Mumps is not spread through casual contact, like sitting next to someone in class. Individuals infected with mumps can spread the virus to other individuals two days prior to salivary gland swelling and up to five days after the swelling begins. Typically, it takes 16 to 18 days after an exposure before a person could develop symptoms. However, symptoms may show in as little as 12 days or not until 25 days after the exposure.</p>
<p>Please watch for signs or symptoms of mumps, especially swelling of the salivary glands (most commonly seen with the parotid glands). If you develop swelling and tenderness of the parotid glands, please contact the Student Health Center or your private health provider and bring this letter with you.* (See attached information for your provider.)</p>
<p>The MMR vaccine is the most powerful tool we have for preventing measles, mumps, and rubella. The MMR vaccine is 100% covered by your insurance plan. If you are not sure if you have had your vaccinations, here are some ways to find your immunization records: <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/find-your-immunization-records.png">https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/find-your-immunization-records.png</a></p>
<p>At this time, there is no recommendation for a third MMR vaccination. Other ways to prevent the spread of mumps and other infections include frequent handwashing, covering your coughs and sneezes, staying home when you are sick, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. For more information: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/infographics/mumps-mmr.html">https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/infographics/mumps-mmr.html</a></p>
<p>In working to manage the risk of mumps in our community, we follow the guidance of the California Public Health Department and Santa Cruz County Public Health Division&#8217;s Communicable Disease Unit (CD Unit). The CD Unit is working with close contacts of students with suspected, probable or confirmed mumps. At this time, there is no evidence that members of the general community should isolate themselves or receive a third MMR vaccination to prevent mumps. If these recommendations change, we will inform you.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us with any additional questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Santa Cruz County Public Health Division Communicable Disease Unit: 831-454-4114.</p>
<p>For patients with salivary gland swelling, health providers should collect a buccal swab and contact the Santa Cruz County Communicable Disease Unit promptly. Specimens should be submitted for testing in coordination with the Communicable Disease Unit.

<p>In Zen Buddhism, koans are short parables or questions meant to confront the practitioner with the inadequacy of conventional concepts and habits of thought. Similarly, Aguirre's "cosmological koans" confront the reader with the unexpected nature of the world as described by physics and the mind-boggling ways in which it differs from our subjective experience or intuitive understanding of things.</p>
<p>"I wanted to convey that sense of mystery and wonder that comes from seeing reality in a new way," said Aguirre, a professor of physics and holder of the Faggin Family Presidential Chair for the Physics of Information at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The book covers a wide range of topics, woven together with a fictional story line that recounts a journey from Italy to Japan. Multiple universes, the nature of time, the meaning of quantum theory, and entropy and information are among the subjects explored in short chapters that manage to convey mind-bending ideas in a way that is accessible and entertaining.</p>
<p>The topics include some of the most challenging open questions in cosmology and physics, as well as concepts that have long been settled science yet remain disturbingly counterintuitive. With respect to the enduring mystery of time, for example, Einstein showed that there is no universal "now"&#8212;in other words, different observers can have different perceptions of whether two events are simultaneous.</p>
<p>Aguirre celebrates the accomplishments of modern physics in penetrating the mysteries of nature, while showing how many thorny questions remain unsettled. "We should take credit for how well we've done in understanding reality, while acknowledging that a lot of those concepts are more tricky and slippery than you might think."</p>
<p>The role of the observer and the connections between what happens in the outer world and the inner experience of conscious observers is a recurring theme in the book.</p>
<p>"Things we tend to view as purely objective are more subjective or dependent on our perspective than we think," Aguirre said. "There is a sense in which we as observers are co-creators of the outside world. But that doesn't mean anything goes&#8212;there is a reality that pushes back on us. You can't just walk off a cliff and pretend there is no gravity."</p>
<p>Another key idea in the book is the importance of information as a coequal constituent of the universe along with matter and energy. The content of the book was inspired not only by Aguirre's own research, which covers a variety of topics in theoretical cosmology, but also by his work as associate scientific director of the <a href="https://fqxi.org/">Foundational Questions Institute</a>, which supports research on innovative ideas in cosmology and physics that are unlikely to be supported by conventional funding sources.</p>
<p>MIT physicist Max Tegmark, who co-founded the institute with Aguirre, had high praise for <em>Cosmological Koans</em>. "Reading it won't leave you with all the answers (we physicists are still searching for them), but it will leave you with a deepened sense of mystery, awe, and appreciation both for your universe and for your own life and experience therein," he wrote.</p>
<p>Aguirre will give a public talk on Tuesday, June 18, at the UC Santa Cruz Silicon Valley Campus in Santa Clara as part of the <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/kraw-lecture/index.html">Kraw Lecture Series on Science and Technology</a>.

<p>The UCSC Feminist Studies Department was founded in 1974 and is one of the oldest and largest programs focused on gender and sexuality studies in the country. The department accepted its inaugural grad cohort in 2013.</p>
<p>The Ph.D. program in feminist studies at UCSC has two objectives: to train scholars and teachers; and to develop professional skills for careers in areas such as public policy and human rights research and advocacy.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, the department has contributed to the development of internationally recognized feminist scholarship and activism, and the Ph.D. program is designed to continue this legacy.</p>
<p><strong>Erin McElroy&#8217;s</strong> dissertation project, "Unbecoming Silicon Valley: Techno Imaginaries and Materialities in Postsocialist Romania," looks at spaces of technological entanglement and contradiction between post-Cold War Silicon Valley and post-socialist Romania. Drawing upon two years of fieldwork in Bucharest and Cluj, and five years of research in Silicon Valley, her project aims to decenter Silicon Valley from normative IT geographies.</p>
<p>McElroy is co-founder of the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project (AEMP), a data visualization, digital humanities, and critical cartography collective that produces maps and analyses to support on-the-ground housing justice struggles. Building upon this work, she is now in the process of launching new collaborations with researchers and collectives transnationally.</p>
<p>Her book, <em>Counterpoints: Bay Area Data and Stories for Resisting Displacement</em>, is scheduled to be published by PM Press in Spring 2020. A collaboration with other AEMP members, it encompasses geographies ranging from Vallejo to Santa Cruz in an effort to tell a regional story of gentrification, particularly as it is racialized and classed.</p>
<p>McElroy has been offered a postdoctoral&#160;position at New York University in order to continue this research following graduation and has also received funding from the British Academy to investigate the use of artificial intelligence in real estate speculation.</p>
<p><strong>Veronika Zablotsky</strong>'s dissertation, &#8220;Governing Armenia: The Making of Global Diaspora in West Asia,&#8221; investigates the impact of forced displacement on visions of return in the Armenian diaspora. Informed by transnational and postcolonial feminist perspectives, she examines diasporic return as a vehicle of global development in Armenia.</p>
<p>Working in four languages, Zablotsky does original research that connects archives and field sites across Eastern Europe, West Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>She is the recipient of a two-year Armenian Studies Dissertation Scholarship of the Funda&#231;&#227;o Calouste Gulbenkian in Portugal. She was also part of the inaugural cohort of the THI Public Humanities Fellows on &#8220;Race &amp; Freedom,&#8221; a Dissertation Fellow with the CUNY Committee on Globalization and Social Change, and a Visiting Scholar at the Harriman Institute for Russian, Eurasian, and East European Studies at Columbia University.</p>
<p>During her fieldwork in Yerevan, Zablotsky was additionally a Research Fellow in the Political Science and International Affairs Program at the American University of Armenia.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz commencement weekend was a time for graduates to honor those who helped them along the way&#8212;the mentors, friends, colleagues, extended family, parents, and children who cheered them on and guided their path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ceremonies for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 10 colleges, Graduate Division, and Baskin School of Engineering took place June 14&#8211;16.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The celebrations, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/06/keynote-addresses-inpsiring-commencement-2019-feature.html">featuring an array of inspiring speakers,</a> &#160;kicked off on Friday morning on the East Field, where a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pproximately 200 graduate students participated in the Graduate Division&#8217;s commencement ceremonies. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many grads took the time to pay tribute. That was certainly the case for Michelle Tija, who walked alongside her professor of molecular and cell biology, Yi Zuo, as she waited to receive her Ph.D. in molecular cell development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She has been so supportive, and so patient with me,&#8221; Tija said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tija&#8217;s work, she set out to understand how molecular mechanisms affect the plasticity of neuronal synapses. As she made her way forward with her research, &#8220;all my mentor&#8217;s feedback propelled my research forward. She provided the guardrails and the steering, and asked, &#8216;What is the next step?&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly the moment was overwhelming for Zuo, too. &#8220;It was amazing to see her growth,&#8221; Zuo said. &#8220;To me, it&#8217;s a big sister&#8217;s feeling, or a mother&#8217;s feeling, to see how she grew. It&#8217;s so exciting, but a little bit sad, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proud recipients of advanced degrees also enjoyed the uninhibited displays of support from their loved ones. Susan Citrak, earning a&#160;Ph.D. in inorganic materials chemistry, was up on the stage,&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">waiting to get her degree, when she heard her young son shouting &#8220;Go Mom!&#8221; from the audience. When she walked down the stairs after getting her degree, he ran up and gave her a hug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How lucky I am to have a son who is such a cheerleader for me!&#8221; she remarked later on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others honored the cultures and the transformative moments that built, nurtured, and sustained them on the way. Kara Hisatake wore a traditional, handwoven lei paying tribute to her ancestry. Her research focused on </span><a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/satocenter/langnet/definitions/hce.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawai</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8217;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">i Creole English</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or what is more commonly known as Pidgin in Hawai&#8217;i, in literature, comedy/performance, and the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out on East Field, the most popular seating area was beneath the shelter of the white tents, as usual. But on Friday morning, the celebrating families were not using the tent to escape from the usually blistering graduation-day sun. Instead, they were sheltering from the blowing fog and occasional rain spatters. By afternoon, the gloom gave way to sunshine so intense that revelers repurposed their umbrellas as parasols.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The celebration seemed to pass in a flash for the graduates, especially those who had labored for years in pursuit of their advanced degrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty amazing to see six years of work condensed down to this!&#8221; gushed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecology and evolutionary biology Ph.D. recipient </span><a href="http://mehta.eeb.ucsc.edu/sarahkienle/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah Kienle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then again, graduation day was not the first time that Kienle had to condense six years of intensive work into a fleeting and life-changing moment. Earlier in the year, Kienle won the top prize at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Grad Slam competition for a lightning-fast, humor-accented talk about sexual dimorphism in elephant seals and how the dramatically different appearances of the males and females corresponds to their feeding and hunting strategies. </span></p>
<p><strong>Farewell to a chancellor </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Graduate Division ceremony was emotional for a different reason for the keynote speaker, UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal, who took the occasion to give thanks and farewell; this was his last commencement as the top UC Santa Cruz administrator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He combined some surprising words of wisdom and advice with disarming humor. At one point he assured the sleep-deprived graduate students that they would soon be able to catch up on all their lost slumbers, &#8220;hopefully </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I finish my remarks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blumenthal recalled the moment, soon after his appointment as chancellor, when UC Santa Cruz alumnus and Silicon Valley entrepreneur Gordon Ringold gave him two books: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curious George Gets a Medal </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curious George Gets a Job, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">about a precocious monkey. Blumenthal revealed his affinity with the famous children&#8217;s book character who often got himself in trouble, only to make sure everything turned out just fine in the end. Blumenthal said that curious risk-taking spirit sustained him during his influential studies on dark matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also urged grad students to put their UC Santa Cruz work to the best use, communicating their work so clearly that anyone, from all walks of life, could understand and benefit from it. He referred to a question he often posed to Ph.D. candidates defending their dissertations: &#8220;Explain to me how you&#8217;ve advanced human knowledge.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Will we get through this?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus was bustling, and for good reason. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 5,200 UC Santa Cruz students are earning undergraduate and graduate degrees for work completed during the 2018&#8211;19 academic year. Every one of those graduates had a story about perseverance and hard work, whether they were in it for a six-year marathon or a one-year sprint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drishti Bhardwaj, &#160;who earned an M.S. in applied economics and finance, is about to finish up a program that lasted only a year, but it was extremely intense; she had to fulfill the same requirements she would have faced in a two-year course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Toward the end of the course, there was that feeling of, &#8216;Will we get through this?&#8217;&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though she was excited to take part in the ceremony, the hard work is not quite over just yet; Bhardwaj still has to take her majors exam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I&#8217;ve done all the work,&#8217;&#8217; she added with a smile. &#8220;I think it&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A total of 4,488 undergraduate students are candidates for bachelor degrees for work completed in the arts, engineering, humanities, physical and biological sciences, and social sciences. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">N</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">early 2,700 undergraduates had applied to participate in college commencement ceremonies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those numbers may seem overwhelming, especially when you consider that these newly minted alumni will join a community of more than 100,000 Banana Slugs. But personal interactions brought the ceremonies down to a human scale. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everywhere, friends and family were lining up to ambush those scholars with bear hugs, floral leis, and sunflower bouquets. Parents nervously fussed with their grown-up children&#8217;s ties, collars, tassels, and graduation caps. Some waved stick-mounted placards with blown-up color photos of their progeny&#8217;s smiling faces. </span></p>
<p><strong>Paying tribute to nurturing families and future selves</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ysmeralda Diestro (College Nine &#8216;19, business management/economics with emphasis on accounting) posed for photos with her loved ones and paid tribute to her heritage with the Filipino flag emblazoned on her graduation stole, the garment she draped across her shoulders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diestro, a first-generation college student, immigrated to the United States 13 years ago when she was 9. Eleven long years would pass, after her arrival in this country, before she could see her relatives again in the Philippines. In those days before WiFi was omnipresent, she was forced to rely on expensive pre-paid call cards just to catch up with her beloved family. It was lonely and much too quiet in her new home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was used to people yelling, laughing, and cooking,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But all the while, she knew her family members were rooting for her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What really stuck with me was something my grandmother said, that money comes and goes, but education is something no one can ever take away from you. I just feel really blessed, thinking of everything I had to go through, and where I am now,&#8221; Diestro said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, graduates also paid tribute to the people they wished to become, as if those older and wiser versions of themselves were looking back and guiding their footsteps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victoria Debrito (College Nine &#8216;19, sociology with minor in education) wore a hand-decorated graduation cap that said, &#8220;Teach from the heart, Ms. Victoria.&#8221; When asked if she was honoring a teacher from her distant past, Debrito explained that the honoree was her future self. She plans to earn a credential in education and fulfill her dream of being a teacher. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="581106908072701734bebd3cb54bf2a1"><name>svlink-open-house</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Startup presentations featured at SVLink Open House on June 18</title><summary>SVLink, a startup incubator-accelerator located at the Silicon Valley Campus, is now fully subscribed.</summary><keywords>SVLink, Silicon Valley</keywords><start-date>1560495600000</start-date><display-name>Startup presentations featured at SVLink Open House June 18</display-name><path>/2019/06/svlink-open-house</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/06/svlink-open-house</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1560550638382</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1560551485991</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioweb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/svlink-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/svlink-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>svlink-500px.jpg</name><display-name>svlink-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>162422</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>people working at a white board</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/sv-link-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/sv-link-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sv-link-80px.jpg</name><display-name>sv-link-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>14389</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>people working at a white board</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>SVLink startups get access to office space and conference rooms, as well as business training for one year.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>UCSC's Silicon Valley startup incubator-accelerator is now fully subscribed</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s effort to help launch the next Uber, Airbnb, or eBay is well under way.</p>
<p>Eighteen startup companies have enrolled with UCSC's new <a href="https://svlink.ucsc.edu/">SVLink program</a>, a startup incubator-accelerator located at the <a href="https://siliconvalley.ucsc.edu/index.html">UC Santa Cruz Silicon Valley Campus</a>. With an additional two startups set to join in July, the program is now fully subscribed.</p>
<p>SVLink is a one-year program that provides office space, business training, and mentoring to participants and connects them with investors. The majority of the startups must have a connection with UC Santa Cruz or other UC campuses to participate.</p>
<p>Those interested in learning more about SVLink are invited to attend an <a href="https://svlink.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/svlink-openhouse.html">Open House</a> on Tuesday, June 18, from 4:30 to 7 p.m. at the UCSC Silicon Valley Campus, 3175 Bowers Avenue, in Santa Clara. Startups enrolled in the program will give presentations on their businesses, which involve artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, the internet of things, distributed computing, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vision for SVLink was to connect UC-wide innovation with the Valley to create opportunities for investment, commercialization, and economic growth, and we are successfully accomplishing that,&#8221; said Scott Brandt, vice chancellor for research at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>SVLink is coordinated by U First Capital, a Santa Clara venture capital firm that works with leading corporations and universities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes a village to build a company&#8212;that&#8217;s the reality,&#8221; said Sanjit Dang, the chairman and co-founder of U First Capital. It can take a long time for start-ups to make connections with venture capitalists on their own, he said. &#8220;We cut through a lot of the process for them, so it brings tremendous value to the startup.&#8221;</p>
<p>Startups can participate in training events once or twice a month in which they can meet founders, experts, and investors in tech.</p>
<p>Dang said he is pleased with the quality of the startups at SVLink. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of potential to disrupt multiple industries and to bring value,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Among the participating startups is sndr, a new security platform that has the capability to annihilate any communication and content even after the content has been sent or forwarded. Nick Puro, the company&#8217;s chief financial officer, said SVLink gives his Orlando, Florida&#8211;based firm a much-needed presence in Silicon Valley. It is very difficult to make the needed connections to get a tech business going without a presence there, he said. Sndr was able to participate in SVLink because a top-level employee attended UC Davis.</p>
<p>Another SVLink startup is Predicta, a recommendation engine to help brands target influencers better. Roger Lang, the chief executive officer, said he is grateful for the introductions to key collaborators in technology, the markets, and capital. SV Link also is helping the firm make UC connections for future talent needs, as well as to recruit advisers and board members.</p>
<p>When asked how useful SVLink is, Lang responded: &#8220;Extremely, from insights into the changing scene around the valley to advice on pragmatic issues in my evolving business plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michele Chamberlin, coordinator of commercialization programs and special projects at UC Santa Cruz, said it took a while to recruit enough startups because of the requirement that companies must have an affiliation with UC. No more than 10 percent of the startups could be unaffiliated. &#8220;Quite a few companies applied that were rejected,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Chamberlin said she hopes the program will ultimately produce successful businesses that will contribute to job creation for UC students. If SVLink goes well, there&#8217;s a chance it could expand beyond one year.</p>
<p>SVLink is funded with the $2.2 million UC Santa Cruz received from Assembly Bill 2664, which provided one-time funding to further innovation and entrepreneurship efforts at UC and surrounding communities.</p>
<p>The SVLink Open House is free of charge and is held in conjunction with the <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/kraw-lecture/">Kraw Lecture Series</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>06-19-2019</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5853dc6e8072701734bebd3c80cbb229"><name>mission-bell</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Mission bell to be removed</title><summary>In partnership with the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, UC Santa Cruz will be removing the mission bell that is located on campus. </summary><start-date>1560535200000</start-date><display-name>Mission bell removal</display-name><path>/2019/06/mission-bell</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/06/mission-bell</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1560555018574</created-on><last-modified-by>madesjar</last-modified-by><last-modified>1560558355869</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In partnership with the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, UC Santa Cruz will be removing the mission bell that is located on campus. The bell was originally donated to the campus by a local women&#8217;s club many years ago and is located near the Hahn Student Services Building.</p>
<p>Mission bells, which were installed across the state to memorialize the California Missions, are viewed by many populations as a symbol of racism and dehumanization of their ancestors.</p>
<p>Campus leaders have been in discussions with Valentin Lopez, chairman of the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, over the past year to coordinate the bell&#8217;s removal. The Amah Mutsun are the direct descendents of the tribal groups whose villages and territories fell under the sphere of influence of Missions San Juan Bautista and Santa Cruz during the late 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Val brought forth concerns to us about the symbolism of the bell. He spoke of the historical injustices and oppression that the bell represents to the Amah Mutsun and indigenous populations. It was such a compelling statement of impact and I am pleased we have been able to work in partnership with them on the removal. Our students have also given voice to the need to remove the bell," said Sarah Latham, vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services.</p>
<p>&#8220;These bells are deeply painful symbols that celebrate the destruction, domination and erasure of our people,&#8221; said Lopez. &#8220;They are constant reminders of the disrespect our tribe faces to this day.&#8221;</p>
<p>A ceremony will take place at 9:30 a.m on Friday, June 21 outside the Hahn building. After comments, the bell will be physically removed.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Humanities</em></strong>&#160;at the Humanities Division&#8217;s 2019 Spring Awards celebration held at the Cowell Ranch Hay Barn.</p>
<p>Established in 2002 to honor outstanding teaching by humanities faculty, the annual award is named in honor of emeritus professor <strong><em><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/01/dizikes-obituary.html">John Dizikes</a></em></strong>, one of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s founding faculty members. It is designed to celebrate the Humanities faculty&#8217;s commitment to excellence in teaching and its impact on undergraduate students.</p>
<p>In addition to being honored&#160;with a check for $3,000, the faculty winner is also entitled to select an undergraduate student to receive a $3,000 scholarship. Dent chose to split the prize between two senior graduating students in feminist studies&#8212;Summer Al-Saleh and Issabella Nguyen.</p>
<p>Since joining the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2002, Dent has been praised by both students and colleagues for creating an inclusive learning environment that both challenges and encourages students, and her teaching has been characterized as life-changing and rigorous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a professor is a great privilege, for many reasons, but especially because we can allow ourselves a life of continuous recalibration,&#8221; said Dent. &#8220;For me, the classroom is a space to redress what I perceive as a primary political problem: the anti-intellectualism that pervades our social world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I seek to respark the form of curiosity that most are forced to lose, unfortunately, as we grow and move through academic spaces, a curiosity that is necessarily dangerous to the status quo. To do this, I have to minimize what are distractions for me&#8212;complex audio-visuals or lectures that must be read&#8212;so that I can meet the eyes of my students.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My teaching is improvisational in the sense that I learned from black musics; strong preparation, intense listening, a respect for silences, and an openness to being changed in the moment are all requirements,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Student scholarship recipient Summer Al-Saleh noted that Dent&#8217;s teaching and mentorship have been invaluable and critical to her while attending UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to thank her for encouraging and nourishing my academic interests, for challenging and pushing the questions I ask, and for supporting me in continuing my education post-graduation,&#8221; said Al-Saleh. &#8220;As a student whose political commitments and academic interests are not always supported in the university, it means a great deal to receive this scholarship--the encouragement and sense of solidarity from Gina has been and remains so important to me."&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Acting humanities dean </strong>and literature professor Karen Bassi addressed the audience prior to the presentation of the awards.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The importance of the humanities is particularly acute in this age of global capitalism, ongoing civil and foreign wars, &#8216;fake&#8217; news, the disputed meaning of &#8216;social&#8217; in social media, the rise of data-driving thinking, global warming, and the increasing reliance on--what is something of an oxymoron--artificial intelligence,&#8221; Bassi observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Research and teaching in the humanities is focused on viewing these and other real-world challenges through the critical lens of <em>human</em> intelligence, guided by the principle that both human and non-human creatures deserve what the ancient Greeks called &#8216;eudaimonia,&#8217; the good life. Students in humanities departments and programs learn that living a good life begins with posing and debating some essential questions: what constitutes justice, what are the barriers to achieving equality, what forms of communication are most effective, what stories--old and new-- can move us to do the right thing, and what are the bases of power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we celebrate today are the myriad ways in which our students and faculty think through these questions and work together to find answers,&#8221; she added.</p>

<div>&#160;</div>
<div>In January, an appellate court ruled that California colleges and universities must hold hearings to resolve sexual misconduct cases in which the respondent is a student, sanctions are potentially severe, and credibility is a central issue. UC took immediate steps to comply with this state ruling by issuing an interim version of Appendix E, which affords parties with a hearing when a case results in a suspension or dismissal.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>At the same time, the UC Office of the President formed a working group that included student, staff, and faculty representatives to identify the best way to meet the court&#8217;s requirements while providing a process that treats parties with respect and compassion, and results in just outcomes. The proposed draft reflects the efforts of the group, the input of key campus stakeholders, and the UC Office of General Counsel.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>The draft version of Appendix E is available <a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/policiesinreview/draft_svsh_app_e_2019.pdf">online</a>. &#160;</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>Our campus Title IX Office also will hold in-person workshops with campus partners to review the changes in policy and gather stakeholder comments. The office also will hold a public listening session to gather public comment. Announcements regarding these workshops will be posted on the <a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu">Title IX website</a>.&#160;</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>Please submit comments to the Policy Coordination Office at <a href="mailto:pco@ucsc.edu">pco@ucsc.edu</a> by the end of business on July 8, 2019.</div></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Title IX Office Director Isabel Dees</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="672bae748072701734bebd3c22170b4b"><name>keynote-addresses-inpsiring-commencement-2019-feature</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Speaking from the heart</title><summary>An array of speakers fired up the crowds throughout this year’s UC Santa Cruz commencement weekend, urging students to embrace compassion and community and imparting valuable life lessons from their pasts. </summary><start-date>1560728520000</start-date><display-name>speakersinspirecommencement2019</display-name><path>/2019/06/keynote-addresses-inpsiring-commencement-2019-feature</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/06/keynote-addresses-inpsiring-commencement-2019-feature</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1560804043602</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1560962122543</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/espino350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/espino350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>espino350.jpg</name><display-name>espino350.jpg</display-name><file-size>48796</file-size><width>350</width><height>298</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/espinothumbnail80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/espinothumbnail80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>espinothumbnail80.jpg</name><display-name>espinothumbnail80.jpg</display-name><file-size>15222</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Espino (Merrill &#8217;87, psychology) had wise words for Merrill College graduates &#160;about identity, pride, strength, and individualism, and the lessons she learned on campus.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few highlights.<br/></span></p>
<p><strong>The gifts of her ancestors</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Espino (Merrill &#8217;87, psychology) delivered a rousting talk for Merrill College&#8217;s commencement about identity, pride, strength, and individualism, and the lessons she learned on campus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born and raised in northeastern Los Angeles, Espino, a lecturer of Chicana and Chicano studies and working class history at UCLA, started out at UC Santa Cruz as a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer student from Pasadena City College. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My life decisions, up to that point, had been hasty and erratic,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My journey to an undergraduate degree was not an easy nor direct path &#8230; My adolescence was filled with endless moments of insecurity and self-doubt. Only later would I realize how much institutional racism and sexism had thrown me off center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My heritage, my culture: the gifts of my ancestors were not valued in 1970s America,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;The push to assimilate was strong and sometimes violent. It was an English-only world&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at UC Santa Cruz, she had a life-changing experience with Elba S&#225;nchez&#8217;s class, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanish for Spanish Speakers,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and A&#237;da Hurtado&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychology of Bilingualism,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and worked a Summer Bridge program with administrator and counselor Rosie Cabrera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These women launched me on a journey of self-recovery,&#8221; Espino said. &#8220;They saw the ancient one in me. They saw my gifts. They saw my beauty. &#8230; They were independent women who valued themselves and honored their heritage as Chicana feminists.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Espino serves on the Board of the California Latinas for Reproductive Justice and the Southwest Oral History Association. In 2018, she and her husband, Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning journalist and author Hector Tobar (Oakes &#8217;88, sociology and Latin American studies), received the UC Santa Cruz Division of Social Sciences&#8217; 2018 Distinguished Alumni Award. </span></p>
<p><strong>Overcoming obstacles to thrive at Apple</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his Crown College commencement keynote remarks, Rick Vargas gave a fascinating look at the inner workings of Apple. Vargas, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a creative director at Apple, works at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts. One of his earliest projects was to give marketing muscle to what was then code-named Jupiter&#8212;a product that went on to become the iPod. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His main takeaway for the graduates was this: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid to voice your ideas. The more you work that muscle, the easier it will be to draw on &#8230; Ideas have the power to change the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also urged them not to let obstacles get in the way. Vargas spoke of his parents, who never graduated from high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We lived in a small trailer in Watsonville,&#8221; he remembered. &#8220;My mom picked strawberries and my dad worked construction. My parents made it through the sheer force of hard work &#8230; And the idea of hard work should not be lost on you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He faced other challenges including dyslexia, but all along, Vargas&#8217;s mother said, &#8220;Mijo (my son), you can do anything!&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Apple, Vargas proved his mother was right. He talked about a &#8220;very intense&#8221; meeting with Steve Jobs in the fall of 2000 about launching the iPod into the world. In the room, there were hundreds of ideas about the launch. All of these ideas were written out on cards pinned to the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Jobs walked over to Vargas, zeroing in on his pinned-up launch idea. &#8220;I thought he was going to let it fall on the floor and step on it,&#8221; Vargas said. &#8220;Instead his face became child-like. He cradled it in his hands like a baby. He turned to me and, in a caring voice, said, &#8216;Can I take this with me?&#8221;&#8217;</span></p>
<p><strong>Compassion, doing well, and doing good</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Brown Childs, UC Santa Cruz emeritus professor of sociology, moved the crowd at the College Ten commencement ceremony, drawing deeply from his experiences doing volunteer work with the civil rights movement in Alabama in 1965, when he experienced a seemingly small yet powerful act of unexpected compassion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Childs recalled a hot, humid day when he was marching with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, an activist group known as the SNCC. The threats to this group were very real.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Along our way, there were many people, all white, mostly young males, yelling that they were going to kill us,&#8221; said Childs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the group moved down a residential street in a white neighborhood, the door of a house swung open. Childs was afraid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I expected to see a shotgun come out, business end first,&#8217;&#8217; he remembered. Instead it was a white woman, offering a jug full of ice water and paper cups to sooth the marchers &#8220;on that sun-blasted day. She had a lot of heart, a lot of courage, to do that in her own neighborhood.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That moment lasted about two minutes &#8230; It was a small moment in a small space. But her action challenged broad, sweeping, reality-based generalizations about the all-too tangible presence of hatred. Her action helps to guide me in my work in the prisons, as a lesson about the complexity of human existence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That woman&#8217;s kindness was a touchtone in a speech on the ways that graduates might fit themselves meaningfully into various social movements, from #MeToo to Black Lives Matter and environmental groups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I do not have an answer as to how to become both a citizen of the world and earn a meaningful income,&#8221; Childs said. &#8220;(But) there is one word that helps me, and I hope will help you. That word is compassion. This caring for others while being aware of your own distinctive self-identity reflects our diverse yet common humanity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Childs is the author of the book&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcommunality, from the Politics of Conversion to the Ethics of Respect,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;which discusses ways for diverse communities to engage in positive interactions. He has been volunteer-teaching courses on transcommunal peacemaking at Soledad Prison for 13 years, in conjunction with the community organization Barrios Unidos. </span></p>
<p><strong>Engineering success </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Hilton (Crown &#8217;86, computer and information science, and math) urged graduates at the Baskin School of Engineering commencement ceremony to pursue their dreams and not to be scared of risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In my early career, I switched jobs four times in my first two-and-a-half years out of school,&#8221; said Hilton, who is the chief product officer at Accolade, a health technology company providing personalized health and benefits solutions to employers, health plans, and their members. &#8220;Some changes were because the company was terrible, some were because I was unhappy and knew the work wasn&#8217;t for me&#8212;in the end, I was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. And that uncertainty&#8212;that trying different things and not settling for jobs that I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be passionate about&#8212;all of that turned out to be absolutely critical in my journey.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before he took his current job &#8220;pursuing a dream &#8230; to make healthcare better for all Americans,&#8221; Hilton and two friends founded a company called Concur, which was a pioneer in cloud computing, travel, and expense management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They ran it for 22 years, and ultimately built it into a billion-dollar business that later sold for $8 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And we stayed friends the whole time. And we didn&#8217;t forget to have fun and be silly along the way. And all of that is basically my second set of advice to you today. Don&#8217;t be afraid to dream the most gigantic of dreams&#8212;they&#8217;re the ones that matter.&#8221;</span></p>

Further, it emphasizes the campus&#8217;s support of the Senate-wide </span><a href="https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/reports/rm-jn-transform-scholarly-communication-declaration-2019.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCOLASC&#8217;s Declaration of Rights and Principles to Transform Scholarly Communication</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the UC Systemwide Library And Scholarly Information Advisory Committee (SLASIAC) </span><a href="https://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/groups/files/slasiac/docs/NegotiatingJournalAgreementsAtUC_ACallToAction_final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">call to action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at transforming how the UC Libraries approach journal negotiations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"People here at UCSC produce such amazing work, it's great to move toward making it open access to allow everyone to learn about it,"&#160;said Karen Otteman, chair of the campus Senate Committee on Scholarly Communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell added, &#8220;As UCSC community members are aware, the </span><a href="https://www.libraryjournal.com/?detailStory=Deal-or-No-Deal-Periodicals-Price-Survey-2019"><span style="font-weight: 400;">costs of scholarly publishing are unsustainable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Access to content needed to conduct research is becoming more difficult for campus libraries to afford. As a member of the UC system, one of the largest producers of scholarly research, it is critical that we support international initiatives like OA 2020.&#8221; &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At UCSC, we are actively engaged in efforts to improve the economics of scholarly publishing and increase the visibility and impact of our scholars&#8217; work through our collaboration with the California Digital Library, SC-COLASC, SLASIAC, and UCOLASC.

<div></div>
<div>On behalf of the Student Union Assembly, we would like to say thank you for allowing us to serve our community, expanding the resources we provide, and support various initiatives and programs of our student body. This time last year, the student body elected us to serve your needs. I campaigned on changes in the SUA. Below are the highlights of this year&#8217;s initiatives:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Secured about half a million dollars to fight for housing justice in Santa Cruz. This includes providing aid to students facing eviction, as well as providing free legal services by hiring a full time lawyer that works for the student body.</li>
<li>Reformed UC policy on police, ensuring body cameras and student accountability over implementation of reforms.</li>
<li>Partnered with engineering student leaders to reform the engineering department, addressing the sexual violence and inappropriate behavior, ongoing. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJIwPw9uep0aw2uKNCUKg42x6H_56JB1PtCPC3W4mCFTXGSg/viewform">Sign our petition here.&#160;</a></li>
<li>Identified necessary changes to UC policy on selecting Chancellors, to become more transparent to students, and ensured UCSC Chancellor search committee accountability.</li>
<li>Fought for the unionization of workers on Student Housing West plan, while advocating for subsidized rooms for low-income students in new housing structures, and ensuring child care facilities are kept affordable for student parents, ongoing.</li>
<li>Reached an agreement with UCOP to meet with Black student leaders across the UC system, regularly.</li>
<li>Represented UC environmental justice values at the United Nations, encouraging global policy makers to carry out sustainable goals by 2030.&#160;</li>
<li>Advocated for AFSCME contract on UC Council of Student Body Presidents, ongoing.</li>
<li>Collaborated with the Snail Movement to pass a faculty resolution supporting safe on-campus overnight parking for our houseless students.</li>
<li>SUA Reforms: Implemented Conflict Resolution protocol, passed the SUA constitutional amendments (thanks to Rep. Stephan Edgars), restructured SUA&#8217;s priorities by moving funding solely into SOFA to focus on organizing in SUA meetings, increased funding for student organizations by about $30,000, increased SUA&#8217;s social media presence by 200%, initiated Committee on Student Worker Protections, now established as the Labor Commission (thanks to the Worker Student Solidarity Coalition), and gave SUA voting seats to International Student Union (thanks to our SUA Treasurer Raphael) as well as the Society of Women Engineers, Fiat Justice, MSA, and the Snail Movement.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>Although much has been done this year, there is so much more work to be done. AFSCME workers still don&#8217;t have a fair contract, and students are still at risk of the various issues pertaining to our campus community. But as we close this academic school year, we must continue to remember that, in the fight against our barriers to success, we must come together to support the collective efforts of liberation. This means turning out for protests, or sharing information with your friends to build awareness of the issues at hand. When we come together, nothing break our organizing apart. Our collective struggles can be met with optimism and support for a better tomorrow.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Thank you for helping us build a better tomorrow.&#160;</div></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin> Student Union Assembly, via the Dean of Students Office</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7acc81518072701734bebd3cdaa5e26b"><name>hammack-exploratorium</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Phil Hammack helps shape Exploratorium's exhibition about identity</title><summary>Psychology Professor Phil Hammack was thrilled to be invited to help plan a new exhibition at the Exploratorium about identity.</summary><keywords>exploratorium, identity, gender, sexuality, hammack</keywords><start-date>1561100400000</start-date><display-name>Hammack-Exploratorium</display-name><path>/2019/06/hammack-exploratorium</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/06/hammack-exploratorium</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1561133350412</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1562009891447</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/images/hammack-exploratorium_400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/images/hammack-exploratorium_400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hammack-exploratorium_400.jpg</name><display-name>hammack-exploratorium_400.jpg</display-name><file-size>70677</file-size><width>400</width><height>518</height></image><image-alt>Phil Hammack at the entrance to the Exploratorium's exhibition about identity</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/images/hammack-genderwheel_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/images/hammack-genderwheel_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hammack-genderwheel_80.jpg</name><display-name>hammack-genderwheel_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>8727</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Close-up photo of the gender wheel exhibit</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Psychology Professor Phil Hammack enjoyed helping exhibition developers figure out how to present complex ideas about identity to the public.

Which is why he was thrilled to help plan the Exploratorium's new exhibit about identity, <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/selfmade">Self, Made</a><span>: Exploring You in a World of We</span>.</p>
<p>About a year ago, Hammack was invited to share his ideas about "the concept of identity in our time" during a two-day planning workshop hosted by the Exploratorium. He was one of 10 scholars who gave 10-minute talks about their ideas before a dozen or so exhibit designers. His talk focused on power, story, and social interaction.</p>
<p>"I'd never done anything like this," said Hammack, a social psychologist whose research focuses on what he calls a "<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/11/hammack-relationships.html">quiet revolution</a>" in sexuality, gender identity, and relationships. "It was a wonderful and, frankly, cool experience as a scholar."</p>
<p>Hammack emphasized "the fluid nature of identity" and shared information about the explosion in sexual and gender identities and relationship practices that he has uncovered in his research.</p>
<p>"Day One was pretty cerebral, and Day Two was led by the exhibit designers," recalled Hammack. "That's when I felt completely out of my element. When the designers asked us how we'd translate our ideas into an exhibit, I really had no idea."</p>
<p>But the exhibition, which opened recently and runs through Sept. 2, is wonderful, said Hammack, who was delighted by how the designers incorporated many of his ideas.</p>
<p>"They really made our academic ideas come to life," he said, adding that the hands-on nature of the Exploratorium's interactive exhibits is engaging.</p>
<p>One exhibit called "Don't Get Me Wrong" gives visitors the opportunity "to write a story about who they are and how they think others see them," said Hammack. Aspects of identity including race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality permeated the stories that visitors shared by posting them on the wall.</p>
<p>Another exhibit, the "Gender Wheel," invites visitors to explore their assumptions about gender. Guests select from a range of descriptors, including "masculine," "feminine," "both," and "neither," to talk about themselves, their presentation, and who they love.</p>
<p>Hammack was invited to participate by the exhibition's project director Melissa Alexander, who also directs public programs at the Exploratorium. Alexander was perusing the <em>Oxford Handbook of Identity Development </em>when she read a chapter written by Hammack that contained this statement: "Identity is the anchoring concept for thinking about difference and sameness in our time. It is not a concept confined to the jargon of the social sciences or the humanities; it permeates our everyday conversations, our moment-to-moment cognitive processes in a world increasingly characterized by diversity."</p>
<p>"That became my rationale for doing the exhibit," said Alexander.</p>
<p>The Exploratorium is about helping people have a functional understanding of how the world works, said Alexander. Social identity is a lens that shapes the way people interpret new evidence&#8212;which can mean using it to confirm their existing beliefs, she said. "Identity is at play in every major news story, whether it's about the climate crisis, immigration, voting, police bias and brutality, gender, or the #metoo movement," she said. "We wanted to provide a learner-centered exploration of the different ways that identity has been constructed by history, art, and science."</p>
<p>UCSC alum Moin Syed (Ph.D. 2009, psychology), an associate professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota, also participated in the two-day brainstorming session. Syed, who specializes in identity development and ethnic identity, shared an anecdote from his childhood that led directly to a popular element in the new exhibit: Designers recreated a souvenir license plate rack like those found in tourist spots, but instead of typical European-derived names, the staff sourced names from lists of the museum's docents, who come from very diverse backgrounds. The exhibit asks visitors, "How does it feel to be excluded&#8212; or <em>finally</em> included?"</p>
<p>"We put Moin's name up, too," said Alexander, noting that she has tapped UCSC experts in the past, and several graduates of the <a href="https://scicom.ucsc.edu/">Science Communication</a> program have been staff writers at the Exploratorium. "UCSC is a great resource for us," she said.</p>
<p>Syed noted that the experience was unique, but he said his time at UCSC provided a valuable foundation for the work.</p>
<p>"UCSC has a major strength in integrating social sciences into educational settings, particularly museums, so the general idea of the project resonated with the way I was trained to think," said Syed, who has also collaborated on projects with the Science Museum of Minnesota and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.</p>
<p>"It was a great opportunity to translate complex ideas to a learning experience that's not in the classroom," said Hammack, who is taking advantage of a range of opportunities to share his work with the public.</p>
<p>Hammack recently discussed his research on the <a href="http://freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics</a> podcast, recorded live in San Francisco. His interview begins 38 minutes into the episode, <a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast-tag/phillip-hammack/">Long-term Thinking in a Start-up Town</a>.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, June 25, at 1 p.m., Hammack and researchers from UCLA and UC San Francisco will discuss generational differences in LGBTQ identity and relationships, as revealed by the <a href="http://www.generations-study.com/">Generations Study</a>, during a Facebook Live event hosted by the UC Office of the President as part of Pride Month.</p>

She said exactly what she thought and was unafraid of speaking the truth. She majored in art at Brooklyn College and in art history at New York University. She earned a master&#8217;s degree from Yale and while there, she was awarded a Fulbright (1959-60) to study medieval art in France. This spurred her passion for research-related travel which would last throughout her lifetime. From 1965-1992, she was a professor of art at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. In 1992, she was hired as the chair of the Art Department at UC Santa Cruz where she taught until 2005. In addition to teaching, Brodsky was a careful researcher and prolific writer. Her works included <em>Experiences of Passage: The Paintings of Yun-Gee and Li-Lan</em>, as well as monographs of artists, art historical works, and critical essays.</p>
<p>Professor Brodsky was a powerful role model. She mentored many female faculty members. Upon arriving at UC Santa Cruz, her first faculty hires were two women who were both lesbian feminist artists. At that time in the early nineties, hiring two women at the same time, much less two feminists, was regarded as a radical act by the University as a whole. As the current chair, and as one of those two hires, I can say with confidence that Joyce Brodsky set the tone for the Art Department&#8217;s current composition being a department with a majority of extraordinarily creative and powerful female faculty members. Our male faculty are also from diverse backgrounds. This is reflective of the fact that Professor Brodsky was a champion of diversity in the arts. Professor Brodsky introduced criticism and theory into the curriculum as an integral part of what students needed to study in order to become informed artists. In addition to her contributions to the University, Joyce always marched with the ACLU in local parades here in Santa Cruz. As Hannah Pederson, our department manager said, &#8220;It was always such a great pleasure to see her marching along, be it Earth Day or Gay Pride, she always walked the walk.&#8221; It was with this socially engaged spirit that Joyce Brodsky ushered the department into contemporary times and thus laid the foundation for our forthcoming M.F.A. in Environmental Art and Social Practice.</p>
<p>According to her daughter Shara, Joyce was funny, shrewd, and loving.&#160;Her family meant the world to her.&#160;Joyce moved to Santa Cruz with her mother Rose. Later, her brother Stephen moved into her Santa Cruz home and lived with her for many years. Her daughter Shara, and her husband Michael, live close by in the southern Bay Area.&#160;Joyce was a passionate and dedicated grandmother.&#160;At the age of 87, she was willing to go through a second aortic aneurism surgery because she wanted to see her grandson Zeke grow into a young man. Her family misses her terribly.</p>
<p>The faculty and staff here at the Art Department and throughout UC Santa Cruz will also miss Joyce. She was a frequent visitor to the UCSC campus and would often come up to take staff out to lunch, even these many years since her retirement. Joyce shared her love of art and art history, giving away some of her favorite books on these subjects to staff when she retired. She was a generous and insightful colleague and we are fortunate to have shared so much time with her.</p>
<p>Joyce&#8217;s family is planning a Celebration of Life that will take place in Santa Cruz, CA on August 4, 2019.

<p><strong>Leta Miller</strong>, professor emeritus of music, <strong>Linda Burman-Hall</strong>, research professor in cultural musicology and<span>&#160;</span><strong>Diane Gifford-Gonzalez</strong>, distinguished research professor of anthropology, were each awarded Edward A. Dickson Emeriti Professorships in recognition of their outstanding achievements in scholarship and teaching.</p>
<p>The awards are given annually and funded by an endowment from the estate of former UC Regent Edward A. Dickson. The professorships make it possible for the university to retain the invaluable services of highly accomplished, retired faculty members for the benefit of its students.</p>
<p>Miller joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1980 and retired in 2016. She has published widely on music in the 20th century, including her 2011 book, <em>Music and Politics in San Francisco: From the 1906 Quake to the Second World &#160;War</em>. She previously co-authored two books on composer Lou Harrison and has published a critical edition of his works.</p>
<p>Miller&#8217;s article on Henry Cowell and John Cage in the <em>Journal of the American Musicological Society</em> won the Lowens award from the Society for American Music. Her biography of Pulitzer-Prize-winning composer Aaron Jay Kernis appeared in 2014, and she is currently completing a book with J Michele Edwards on Chinese American composer Chen Yi.</p>
<p>The Dickson emerti award will help Miller support travel for research on a new book about racial segregation in the American Federation of Musicians from 1896 through the 1960s. The project expands on an article she published in 2007 dealing with the racial struggles in the San Francisco union, extending that research for a book that will now cover the entire country.</p>
<p>Linda Burman-Hall is a specialist in music theory and performance with advanced degrees from UCLA and Princeton University. She is active not only as a recitalist and ensemble director, but also is well known as a research musicologist. After post-doctoral research at the University of Amsterdam, she joined the faculty at UCLA and then UC Santa Cruz, where she taught music theory, harpsichord, chamber music, and world music courses for 35 years before being appointed as a research professor in 2014.</p>
<p>Burman-Hall is founder and artistic director of the Santa Cruz Baroque Festival, which has presented hundreds of early music concerts over the past 46 years. She also founded and directed the nationally recognized American early music ensemble Lux Musica. Her festival appearances include the Carmel Bach Festival, E. Nakamichi Baroque Festival, Berkeley Early Music Festival, and the American Musicological Society. She has also been featured in concerts at the Getty, de Young, Huntington, and Smithsonian Museums, and has played throughout the United States and in Canada, The Netherlands, Germany, and Indonesia, with broadcasts on NPR.</p>
<p>The Dickson award will enable Burman-Hall to honor the 350th birthday of Ireland&#8217;s national composer, Turlough O&#8217;Carolan by researching, producing and directing a full concert of O&#8217;Carolan&#8217;s music for the Santa Cruz campus and community through collaboration with performers who specialize in both Baroque and vernacular Irish music styles. A direct contemporary of J.S. Bach, O&#8217;Carolan was Ireland&#8217;s most famous harpist and continues to be one of the most highly regarded and best known of all Celtic composers today. The concert will take place in fall 2020.</p>
<p>Diane Gifford-Gonzalez is a distinguished research professor of anthropology and a leading practitioner of zooarchaeology, a science she helped pioneer, that analyzes animal remains to better understand human behavior. It is not "just stuff you dig up," she has said. "It is how we imagine these past worlds to push the scientific envelope." Her interests include African archaeology, pastoralism, and Holocene Monterey Bay historical ecology. She has done field work in California, Nevada, and New Mexico, as well as the Netherlands, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>Gifford-Gonzalez, who joined the faculty in 1976 and retired in 2015, is the author of <em>An Introduction to Zooarchaeology. </em>She has served as president of the Society for American Archaeology, as well as a member of the Committee of Honor of the International Conference of Archaeozoology. She also served as the curator for the Monterey Bay Archaeology Archives.</p>
<p>Widely recognized for the quality of her teaching, Gifford-Gonzalez also received the Martin M. Chemers Award for Outstanding Research in the Social Sciences from the Social Sciences Division in 2014.

<p>The discovery was made with the new Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), a 36-dish radio telescope in Western Australia owned and operated by the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).</p>
<p>A team coordinated by UC Santa Cruz astronomer J. Xavier Prochaska performed follow-up observations of the galaxy from which the burst originated, using three of the world&#8217;s largest optical telescopes. The new findings were published online by the journal <em>Science</em> on Thursday, June 27.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the big breakthrough the field has been waiting for since astronomers discovered fast radio bursts in 2007,&#8221; said CSIRO's Keith Bannister, lead author of the paper.</p>
<p>Since then, a global hunt has netted 85 fast radio bursts. Most have been &#8216;one-offs&#8217; but a small fraction are &#8216;repeaters&#8217; that recur at the same spot in the sky. In 2017, astronomers found a repeater&#8217;s host galaxy, but localizing a one-off burst had been unattainable, until now.</p>
<p>Prochaska's team measured the distance to the new burst's host galaxy with the 10-meter Keck II Telescope in Hawaii, then obtained follow-up imaging and spectra with the European Southern Observatory&#8217;s 8-meter Very Large Telescope and the 8-meter Gemini South telescope, both in Chile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Identifying the galaxy that hosted the event and measuring its distance are key to figuring out what generates these enigmatic bursts,&#8221; said Prochaska, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Amazingly, the galaxy for FRB 180924 is completely different from the repeater&#8217;s home galaxy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fast radio bursts last less than a millisecond, making it difficult to detect them and even harder to accurately measure where they have come from. Bannister&#8217;s team developed new technology that can replay the data from when the burst occurred, allowing the location to be determined. This technology was used to pinpoint the location of FRB 180924 to its home galaxy (DES J214425.25&#8722;405400.81), about 3.6 billion light-years away.</p>
<p>"It's like looking at the Earth from the Moon and not only knowing what house a person lived in, but what chair they were sitting in at the dining room table," Bannister said.</p>
<p>ASKAP is the first telescope to both find large numbers of fast radio bursts and identify their origins, thanks to its unique design and signal processing power. Since ASKAP is an array of 36 dish antennas and the burst had to travel a slightly different distance to each dish, it reached each one at a slightly different time.</p>
<p>&#8220;From these tiny time differences&#8212;just a fraction of a billionth of a second&#8212;we identified the burst&#8217;s home galaxy and even its exact starting point, 13,000 light-years out from the galaxy&#8217;s center in the galactic suburbs,&#8221; said team member Adam Deller of Swinburne University of Technology.</p>
<p>The cause of fast radio bursts remains unknown, but the ability to determine their exact location is a big leap towards solving this mystery. Independently, it also gives astronomers a new way to study the diffuse material that occupies the spaces between galaxies, known as the intergalactic medium, because of the way that material affects the radio waves in the burst.</p>
<p>&#8220;These data offer an entirely new method to measure the amount of matter in the cosmos,&#8221; Prochaska said.</p>
<p>The localization of the radio burst was done as part of a science project using ASKAP called CRAFT (Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients) that is jointly led by Bannister, Jean-Pierre Macquart of the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, and Ryan Shannon of Swinburne University of Technology. Shannon and CSIRO astronomer Shivani Bhandari carried out the observations and were the first to spot the burst.</p>
<p>UCSC graduate student Sunil Simha also carried out the optical observations, along with Nicolas Tejos (Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso, Chile) and Stuart Ryder (Macquarie University, Australia).</p>
<p>ASKAP is located at CSIRO&#8217;s Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory in Western Australia and is a precursor for the future Square Kilometre Array telescope. CSIRO acknowledges the Wajarri Yamaji as the traditional owners of the MRO site.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="958265758072701734bebd3cc5b91eaf"><name>coral-reefs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Corals can survive in acidified ocean conditions, but have lower density skeletons</title><summary>A two-year transplantation experiment near a natural low-pH submarine spring evaluated growth and physiological response of different coral species to ocean acidification.</summary><keywords>Adina Paytan, Donald Potts</keywords><start-date>1561532400000</start-date><display-name>Corals can survive in acidified ocean conditions, but have lower density skeletons</display-name><path>/2019/06/coral-reefs</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/06/coral-reefs</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1561581478472</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1571344921627</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value><value>Ocean Sciences</value><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/images/coral-transplants-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/images/coral-transplants-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coral-transplants-410.jpg</name><display-name>coral-transplants-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>87613</file-size><width>410</width><height>308</height></image><image-alt>transplanted corals on seafloor</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/images/coral-transplants-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/images/coral-transplants-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coral-transplants-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>coral-transplants-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18842</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>transplanted corals</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Researchers transplanted coral fragments to sites with low-pH conditions similar those expected with future ocean acidification, then monitored their survival and growth.

A new study led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz shows that at least three Caribbean coral species can survive and grow under conditions of ocean acidification more severe than those expected to occur during this century, although the density of their skeletons was lower than normal.</p>
<p>The study took advantage of the unusual seawater chemistry found naturally at sites along the Caribbean coastline of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, where water discharging from submarine springs has lower pH than the surrounding seawater, with reduced availability of the carbonate ions corals need to build their calcium carbonate skeletons.</p>
<p>In a two-year field experiment, the international team of researchers transplanted genetically identical fragments of three species of corals to a site affected by the springs and to a nearby control site not influenced by the springs, and then monitored the survival, growth rates, and other physiological traits of the transplants. They reported their findings in a paper <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2019.0572">published June 26 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em></a>.</p>
<p>"The good news is the corals can survive and deposit calcium carbonate, but the density of their skeletons is reduced, which means the framework of the reef would be less robust and might be more susceptible to storm damage and bioerosion," said Adina Paytan, a research professor at UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences and corresponding author of the paper.</p>
<p>Of the three species tested, the one that performed best in the low-pH conditions was <em>Siderastrea siderea</em>, commonly known as massive starlet coral, a slow-growing species that forms large dome-shaped structures. Another slow-growing dome-shaped species, <em>Porites astreoides</em> (mustard hill coral), did almost as well, although its survival rate was 20 percent lower. Both of these species outperformed the fast-growing branching coral <em>Porites porites</em> (finger coral).</p>
<p>Coauthor Donald Potts, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, said the transplanted species are all widespread throughout the Caribbean. "The slow-growing, dome-shaped corals tend to be more tolerant of extreme conditions, and they are important in building up the permanent structure of the reef," he said. "We found that they have the potential for persistence in acidified conditions."</p>
<p>Corals will have to cope with more than ocean acidification, however. The increasing carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is also driving climate change, resulting in warmer ocean temperatures and rising sea levels. Unusually warm temperatures can disrupt the symbiosis between coral polyps and the algae that live in them, leading to coral bleaching. And rapidly rising sea levels could leave slow-growing corals at depths where they would die from insufficient sunlight.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Potts noted that several species of Caribbean corals have long fossil records showing that they have persisted through major changes in Earth's history. "These are species with a history of survival and tolerance," he said.</p>
<p>He added that both <em>S. siderea</em> and <em>P. astreoides</em> had higher chlorophyll concentrations at the low-pH site, indicating that their algal symbionts were responding positively and potentially increasing the energy resources available to the corals for resisting stress.</p>
<p>Both of the slow-growing species that did well under acidified conditions have internal fertilization and brood their larvae, so that their offspring have the potential to settle immediately in the same area, Potts said. "This means there is potential for local genetic adaptation over successive generations to changing environmental conditions," he said.</p>
<p>The authors also noted that the differences among coral species in survival and calcification under acidified conditions could be useful information for reef restoration efforts and perhaps even for efforts to genetically modify corals to give them greater stress tolerance</p>
<p>Paytan said she remains "cautiously optimistic," despite the many threats facing coral reefs worldwide.</p>
<p>"These corals are more robust than we thought," she said. "They have the potential to persist with ocean acidification, but it costs them energy to cope with it, so we have to do all we can to reduce other stressors, such as nutrient pollution and sedimentation."</p>
<p>Paytan and Potts said the collaboration with Mexican researchers was essential to the success of the project, enabling frequent monitoring of the transplanted corals throughout the two-year experiment.</p>

<p>Researchers at UC Santa Cruz surveyed students outside of campus dining halls on their tuna consumption habits and knowledge of mercury exposure risks, and also measured the mercury levels in hair samples from the students. They found that hair mercury levels were closely correlated with how much tuna the students said they ate. And for some students, their hair mercury measurements were above what is considered a "level of concern."</p>
<p>"It doesn't necessarily mean that they would be experiencing toxic effects, but it's a level at which it's recommended to try to lower your mercury exposure," said Myra Finkelstein, an associate adjunct professor of environmental toxicology at UC Santa Cruz. "Our results were consistent with other studies of mercury levels in hair from people who eat a lot of fish."</p>
<p><strong>Neurological effects</strong></p>
<p>Tuna and other large fish contain significant amounts of mercury in its most toxic form (methylmercury), and exposure to high levels of methylmercury can cause neurological damage. Because of its effects on neurological development and reproductive health, concerns about mercury exposure are greatest for pregnant women and children. Finkelstein said college students should also limit their exposure to mercury because their nervous systems are still developing and they are of reproductive age.</p>
<p>She said the study was prompted by her experiences teaching students about mercury in the environment and hearing about how much tuna some students eat. "I've been dumbfounded when students have told me they eat tuna every day," Finkelstein said. "Their lack of knowledge about the risk of exposure to mercury is surprising."</p>
<p>Graduate student Yasuhiko Murata led the study and is first author of a paper on their findings, which has been accepted for publication in <em>Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry</em> and is <a href="https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/etc.4513">available online</a>. In the surveys, about a third of students reported weekly tuna consumption, and 80 percent of their tuna meals were at the campus dining halls, where tuna is regularly available from the salad bar. Half of the tuna eaters reported eating three or more tuna meals per week, potentially exceeding the "reference dose" established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), considered a maximum safe level (0.1 micrograms of methylmercury per kilogram of body weight per day).</p>
<p>Before the results were published, Finkelstein discussed her team's findings with UCSC administrators who oversee the dining halls. New signs in the campus dining halls will now give students information about mercury in tuna and guidelines for fish consumption. Other changes may be made after a more thorough assessment, said William Prime, executive director of dining services.</p>
<p>Finkelstein said this issue could be a concern for all kinds of institutions with dining halls, especially those serving children, such as boarding schools. "Any time you have a dining hall situation where people are helping themselves, some residents may be eating way too much tuna," she said.</p>
<p><strong>Servings per week</strong></p>
<p>Nearly all fish contain some mercury, but tuna, especially the larger species, are known to accumulate relatively high levels of the toxic metal. Consumers are advised to eat no more than two to three servings per week of low-mercury fish (including skipjack and tongol tuna, often labeled "chunk light") or one serving per week of fish with higher levels of mercury (including albacore and yellow fin tuna).</p>
<p>Some of the students surveyed at UC Santa Cruz reported having more than 20 servings of tuna per week. The researchers analyzed the mercury content of the tuna being served in the dining halls, collecting samples periodically over several months, and found that the mercury content was variable, with some samples having five times as much mercury as others.</p>
<p>"Some chunk light tuna was actually quite high in mercury, although typically it has only half or one-third as much as albacore," Finkelstein said.</p>
<p>The researchers calculated that, to stay below the EPA reference dose, a 140-pound person could consume up to two meals per week of the lower-mercury tuna but less than one meal per week of the higher-mercury tuna.</p>
<p>After conducting an initial survey and hair analysis, the researchers conducted a second survey with more detailed questions designed to probe students' knowledge about mercury in tuna and recommended consumption rates. Whether they were tuna eaters or not, most students had very little knowledge about this issue, Finkelstein said. A majority of students answered that it is safe to eat two to three times as much tuna per week as is recommended.</p>
<p>"It was not a large sample size, but only one out of 107 students surveyed had a high level of knowledge as well as confidence in that knowledge, so I think it's important to provide students with more information about safe levels of tuna consumption," she said.</p>
<p>Recommendations regarding consumption of tuna and other fish are complicated by the fact that fish is highly nutritious and contains beneficial omega-3 fatty acids and other nutrients. In addition, mercury concentrations vary widely among different types of fish. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and EPA have issued <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/eating-fish-what-pregnant-women-and-parents-should-know">advice on eating fish for pregnant women, parents, and caregivers of young children</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to Myra Finkelstein and Yasuhiko Murata, the coauthors of the paper include Doreen Finkelstein, a social scientist and research analyst at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills who developed the survey questions, and Carl Lamborg, associate professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9efc9b448072701734bebd3cdd5414da"><name>rankings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz among the world’s best in two new global rankings</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz and other UC campuses were named among the world’s best universities in two separate rankings this week.</summary><start-date>1561705200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz among the world’s best in two new global rankings</display-name><path>/2019/06/rankings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/06/rankings</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1561740482604</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1561740637329</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioweb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/images/researcher-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/images/researcher-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>researcher-300.jpg</name><display-name>researcher-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>43747</file-size><width>300</width><height>206</height></image><image-alt>researcher in lab</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/06/images/researcher-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/06/images/researcher-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>researcher-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>researcher-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16368</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>researcher in lab</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UCSC researchers are among the most productive in the world.

<p>Scientific journal <a href="https://www.natureindex.com/annual-tables/2019/institution/all/all"><em>Nature</em></a> named all 10 campuses and UC's three affiliated national laboratories in its index of the top 500 institutions and universities that dominated research last year in the natural sciences. <em>Nature</em> developed its list by evaluating the volume of high-quality research published in a select group scientific journals in 2018. UC Santa Cruz and eight other UC campuses ranked among the top 100 North American academic institutions.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that when it comes to producing ground-breaking, peer-reviewed research in the life sciences, chemistry, physical sciences, and Earth and environmental sciences, the 10-campus UC system is among the world&#8217;s most prolific.</p>
<p>QS World Rankings also issued <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020">its list of the world&#8217;s top 1,000 undergraduate universities</a>, with eight UC campuses, including UC Santa Cruz, among the global elite.</p>
<p>QS compiled its list through a weighted assessment that included academic reputation, reputation among employers, faculty-student ratio, citations per faculty, and the ratio of international faculty and international students on campuses.</p>
<p>Academic reputation accounted for 40 percent of the score, with universities being assessed based on a survey of 94,000 people in higher education who were asked their opinions regarding teaching and research quality at the world&#8217;s universities.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ae93da5a8072701734bebd3cc37a2874"><name>sap-year-end-udate</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>SAP year-end update</title><summary>Over the course of the past year, our community's input and feedback has helped shape our Strategic Academic Plan. </summary><start-date>1560495600000</start-date><display-name>SAP year-end update</display-name><path>/2019/06/sap-year-end-udate</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/06/sap-year-end-udate</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1562002052842</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1562002376492</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Over the course of the past year, our community's input and feedback has helped shape our Strategic Academic Plan.

<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I am excited that <a href="https://leadership.ucsc.edu/announcements/ucop/" style="color: #00458c; text-decoration: underline; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">we will soon be welcoming Cynthia Larive to UC Santa Cruz as our next chancellor</a>. During a recent one-day visit to campus to meet briefly with campus leadership, she expressed interest in getting involved in the strategic academic planning effort, which has been underway for nearly two years. I anticipate that once she arrives, Cynthia will want to take some time to identify how she would like to move forward with the SAP implementation. As a result, I expect distribution of the final plan will be delayed by a few months.</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">In 1972, shortly after I arrived on campus, then-Chancellor Dean McHenry summoned me to his office. I responded, although with considerable trepidation. I wondered, what had I done wrong? Are they going to fire me &#8212; already? It turns out the chancellor simply wanted to meet new faculty members and say hello. Forty-seven years later, I still chuckle at the memory.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I couldn't have imagined back then that one day I would share with Chancellor McHenry the immense honor of serving as the leader of this remarkable institution. It has been my privilege to do so for the past 13 years, and I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to serve as UC Santa Cruz's 10th chancellor. Together we have accomplished so much.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I was asked the other day what I would miss most about my time as chancellor. That's easy. Before taking the position, I knew for the most part what a chancellor did. What I didn't realize was how frequently I would be called upon to mark the incredible achievements of so many in our community. I soon came to marvel at the breadth of excellence on this campus. Regularly celebrating the impressive accomplishments of so many staff, faculty, and students stirs the soul. I will miss that the most, without question.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">As I approach my last day as chancellor, I want you to know I am not heading out to pasture. On Aug. 1, I begin a new part-time role as faculty director of the Center for Studies in Higher Education at UC Berkeley. I am eager to draw attention to issues of higher education that are unique to California, and to advocate for the multi-disciplinary scholarly approach to issues that we at UC Santa Cruz have long championed. I also plan to continue my astrophysics research here on campus, so a passive retirement is not in my future.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I leave the Chancellor's Office feeling proud and optimistic &#8212; and confident that the campus is in capable hands.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">With appreciation for the wonderful memories, I offer two final words: Fiat Slug!</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="afaeed088072701734bebd3c3132d39f"><name>kerr-road-closure</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Closure on Kerr Road, adjoining pedestrian path</title><summary>Campus is continuing necessary construction and road repairs during the summer months, sometimes implementing road closures that affect traffic.

<p dir="ltr"><strong>When that happens, we will no longer have direct access to 2019 articles (in all Elsevier journals) and the backfiles of certain journals</strong><span> </span><a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Elsevier-SD-UC-No-PTA-2018.12.19.xlsx" moz-do-not-send="true"><span>(download the list)</span></a><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Everything else will still be accessible on ScienceDirect. </span><span>Once the shut off is confirmed, we will publish a notice on the </span><a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-at-uc/publisher-negotiations/uc-and-elsevier/" moz-do-not-send="true"><span>Office of Scholarly Communication website</span></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Last year, the University of California entered negotiations for a new agreement with Elsevier that would not only continue UC&#8217;s access to its online journals, but also achieve the </span><a href="https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/reports/academic-council-statement-elsevier-feb28.pdf" moz-do-not-send="true"><span>faculty-supported goals</span></a><span> of containing journal subscription costs and providing for open access publication of UC research. Unfortunately, in late February the </span><a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-terminates-subscriptions-worlds-largest-scientific-publisher-push-open-access-publicly" moz-do-not-send="true"><span>negotiations stalled</span></a><span>. In the months since, Elsevier has continued to provide access to new articles via ScienceDirect without a contract in place.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Other ways to access Elsevier articles</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The library is prepared to help you access articles that are no longer available via ScienceDirect. </span><strong>Information about <a href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/ill/alternativeaccess" moz-do-not-send="true">other ways to access Elsevier articles</a></strong><span> is also available on the library&#8217;s website, which provides guidance on how to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Use the </span><a href="http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local/cgi/core/citation-linker.cgi" moz-do-not-send="true"><span>interlibrary loan (ILL) request form</span></a><span>. Any request for content no longer licensed through Elsevier will automatically be placed into a rush queue. ILL requests made in Melvyl or via UC-eLinks will also be expedited.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Use tools like </span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/" moz-do-not-send="true"><span>Google Scholar</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://unpaywall.org/products/extension" moz-do-not-send="true"><span>Unpaywall </span></a><span>and </span><a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/" moz-do-not-send="true"><span>Open Access Button</span></a><span> to quickly find open access copies, when available.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Email the corresponding author listed in the abstract to request a copy.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>We are here to help. Contact our Interlibrary Loan staff at </span><a href="mailto:ill@ucsc.edu" moz-do-not-send="true"><span>ill@ucsc.edu</span></a><span> </span><span>so we can best facilitate your needs.</span></p>

</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We will be carefully evaluating the impact of losing access to new articles on ScienceDirect over the coming months, and will do our best to ensure that you have access to the articles you need. Meanwhile, UC is hoping to reenter formal negotiations with Elsevier if the publisher indicates that they are willing to discuss a contract that addresses our goals of cost containment and open access.</span></p>
