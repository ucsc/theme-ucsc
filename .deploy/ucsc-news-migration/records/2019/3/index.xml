<p>Conceived by UC Santa Cruz physics lecturer Stephanie Bailey, <em>The Fusion of Art and Physics</em>&#160;features work created by 17 pairs of artists and physics graduate students. The exhibit opened March 1 at the R. Blitzer Gallery in Santa Cruz and&#160;is meant to help people to access and engage with physics through art and to think about the role physics plays in the world.</p>
<p>Last fall, Bailey organized <a href="../../2018/12/motors-surround-us.xml">another science-art collaboration</a> with the show <em>Motors Surround Us</em>, a piece of art created from simple electric motors made by introductory physics students.</p>
<p>Bryson Bost, an artist who creates intricate patterns using acrylics and pigment inks, was linked up with physics doctoral student Johnny Davenport. The young scientist showed Bost the instruments he uses to explore really thin crystals at the lab and how it is possible to see what the crystals look like on an atomic scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could actually see the spaces in between atoms,&#8221; said Bost. &#8220;It was like I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m seeing a pocket dimension. It&#8217;s almost science fiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bost was honored to get a chance to see a world he has no experience with and enthralled by Davenport&#8217;s explanation of his work. &#8220;It&#8217;s so advanced you feel like you&#8217;re talking to a messenger of some god,&#8221; Bost said. &#8220;You feel like you&#8217;re getting in touch with some strange divine formula.&#8221;</p>
<p>For his part, Davenport said he enjoyed the opportunity to translate his ideas into ordinary language and not just get mired in technical jargon. Davenport thinks scientists spend too much time in their own world.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of times we fall back on technical language to be able to communicate complicated concepts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The hardest thing to do is to distill it down to something presentable through a different medium or a different audience. Science isn&#8217;t just intended to benefit scientists.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that first dialogue, Bost went back to his studio and began working on the creation for the show. He spent about 40 hours creating a piece filled with intricate patterns created with acrylics and pigment ink that were inspired by the atomic-level images he saw. Physics doctoral student Benjamin Lehmann, 25, enjoyed getting to try out his artistic side with his partnership with quilt artist Ann Baldwin May</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a completely new experience for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have no experience with art and I never thought of myself as an artistic person.&#8221;</p>
<p>He liked experimenting with fabric a bit even though his ideas didn&#8217;t make it into the final piece. &#8220;I had fun playing around a bit,&#8221; he said. Lehmann began by talking to May about his work studying what the universe is made of. Eighty percent of the universe is made of something invisible called dark matter and scientists have no idea what it is. &#8220;What I do all day is think about what it could be or not be and test the idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing he examines is the way particle physics (the very small) is related to cosmology (the very large). He showed her both images taken from observational astronomy with telescopes and images from particle colliders. May decided to create art pieces that reflected the crossover between those two areas.</p>
<p>Lehmann soon saw that art was an effective way to communicate. By looking at May&#8217;s art, he was able to see what she understood from his explanations about his scientific work.</p>
<p>May liked hearing about Lehmann&#8217;s investigations and was amazed to learn that when subatomic particles smash together, they break apart in predictable patterns and colors. She created a total of four quilts inspired by the images Lehmann showed her.</p>
<p>At first, she tried to copy the images she saw exactly with her fabrics. But then she decided to give herself permission to change it so it would work with her artistic sensibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was definitely worth it,&#8221; she said about the experience. &#8220;What it allowed me to do is my do my art in a different way that was successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the goals of the <em>Fusion</em> show is to enable people to access and engage with physics through art and to think about the role physics plays in the world. The collaboration was intended to foster stronger communication skills among physicists in speaking to non-professionals.</p>
<p><em>The exhibition is curated by participating artist Tauna Coulson. An opening reception is March 1 from 5&#8211;9pm and will feature live music, hors d&#8217;oeuvres and discussion. A panel discussion of participating artists and physicists is March 16 from noon to 2 p.m. R. Blitzer Gallery is at 2801 Mission St., Santa Cruz.

<p>The Regents will be asked to consider Student Housing West as well as the Kresge College renewal. The campus <a href="https://ppc.ucsc.edu/planning/EnvDoc.html">published final environmental impact reports</a> for both projects at the end of February.</p>
<p>The Regents meet March 13&#8211;14 at UCLA. The <a href="https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/meetings/index.html">agenda will soon</a> be posted online, and the meeting will be <a href="https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/meetings/index.html">streamed live</a>.</p>
<p>Both Student Housing West and Kresge College are focused on supporting the needs of UC Santa Cruz students.</p>
<p>Though UC Santa Cruz provides housing for 9,300 students&#8212;roughly half of its student body&#8212;there remains an urgent need for affordable campus housing, especially for upper-division students who otherwise would be living in the surrounding community. Student Housing West is the single largest housing project underway in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>As proposed, <a href="http://ucsc.edu/shw">Student Housing West</a> will create 3,072 new beds at two sites on the UC Santa Cruz main campus, one along Heller Drive, the other along Hagar Drive. Additionally, it will provide a new childcare facility that will be able to extend service to the children of faculty and staff, in addition to students.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz brought Student Housing West as a discussion item during the January meeting of the Regents.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/">Kresge College renewal</a> aims to update the iconic college by knitting beloved landmarks with new upgrades to meet the needs of today&#8217;s student body. The college was constructed in 1973.</p>
<p>Of Kresge&#8217;s 21 existing buildings, 11 will be renovated and rebuilt. Others will be removed to make way for new viewsheds, commons, gathering spaces, and accessibility features, including a &#8220;stramp&#8221; (a hybrid staircase and ramp) for wheelchair users. Buildings meant for similar uses&#8212;living, learning, support&#8212;will be grouped together rather than sprinkled haphazardly or placed inconveniently far from each other.</p>
<p>Plans for the north section of the Kresge campus would include new and larger residence hall accommodations; a new academic plaza and academic facility; the Kresge provost&#8217;s offices and classrooms, including a 600-seat lecture hall, which would become the largest of its kind on campus; a 150-seat lecture hall; and 50- and 35-seat classrooms. A 48-seat computing lab is also included.</p>
<p>The Regents will also learn more about the campus plan to rebuild <a href="../university-house-event-center.xml">University House and Event Center</a>.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3af6d6a080727017244b86d99ca2fcb1"><name>brandt-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Federal funds invested in research infrastructure</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz will invest nearly $6 million in its research tools this academic year, thanks to awards from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes for Health. </summary><start-date>1551772800000</start-date><display-name>Research tools</display-name><path>/2019/03/brandt-keynote</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/03/brandt-keynote</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1551472448289</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1551472448289</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Brandt</name><title>Vice Chancellor, Research</title><phone/><email>vcr@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/tuesday-newsday/2017/august-08/images/brandt-250px.jpg</path><link>site://news/tuesday-newsday/2017/august-08/images/brandt-250px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brandt-250px.jpg</name><display-name>brandt-250px.jpg</display-name><file-size>54358</file-size><width>250</width><height>175</height></image><image-alt>Scott Brandt</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Vice Chancellor Scott Brandt</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/03/images/mccarthy-isotope-300px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/03/images/mccarthy-isotope-300px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mccarthy-isotope-300px.jpg</name><display-name>mccarthy-isotope-300px.jpg</display-name><file-size>161795</file-size><width>300</width><height>397</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>With the new grant, the Stable Isotope Lab will acquire a cutting-edge instrument called an isotope-ratio-monitoring mass spectrometer (IRMS).</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>UC Santa Cruz will invest nearly $6 million in its research tools this academic year, thanks to awards from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes for Health. <br/><br/>Each year, we can submit three proposals to the NSF&#8217;s Major Research Instrumentation program, which typically funds about 20 percent of proposals. This year, we had the unprecedented success of seeing all three proposals funded, totaling $2.8 million. The program requires a 30 percent campus match, so our campus collaborators contributed an additional $1.2 million. <br/><br/>With the NSF funding, the campus will now have:<br/>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="../../2018/09/supercomputer.xml">powerful new supercomputer</a> for researchers in fields ranging from astrophysics to climate science;</li>
<li>a new <a href="../01/isotope-lab-spectrometer.xml">state-of-the-art spectrometer</a> that will support research in oceanography, earth science, paleontology, anthropology, and ecology; and</li>
<li>a new <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/news/nsf-funds-uc-santa-cruz-development-multifocus-structured-illumination-microscope">multifocus structured illumination microscope</a></li>
</ul>
The faculty members who submitted the MRI grants span three divisions and eight departments. Some recently joined campus, while others are senior researchers. <br/><br/>We also secured about $2 million from the National Institutes of Health to support our biologists and biochemists with:<br/>
<ul>
<li>A new cryo-electron microscope that will enable biologist to better characterize protein and virus structures, as well as image tissue and cell samples.</li>
<li>A new biolayer interferometer that will serve as a critical tool for biochemistry and drug discovery.</li>
</ul>
The funding underscores our excellence in many areas and is critical in ensuring we can continue our track record of groundbreaking research that creates new knowledge for our society.<br/><br/>I want to thank the faculty members for coming to our office with well-crafted ideas and our <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/ord/index.html">Research Development staff</a>, who help in developing proposals.<br/><br/>Our staff members can help translate creative and innovative ideas into research and scholarly activities, programs, and projects, and are ready to assist our faculty with their ideas and proposals. <br/><br/>We have selected and submitted three proposals for this year's round of MRI funding and continue look for other opportunities to support the campus mission. <br/><br/> With our excellent faculty, talented staff, and commitment to excellence, I'm optimistic we'll be able to celebrate continued investment in our research infrastructure.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

href="https://www.leonardo.info/laser-talks"><em><strong>Leonardo Art/Science Evening Rendezvous (LASER)</strong></em></a><span>&#160;</span>is a national program of evening gatherings that brings together artists, scientists, and scholars for informal presentations and conversations.</p>
<p>The goal of the series is to feature compelling new developments in the arts and sciences, and to attract audiences that would not normally be found at the same gathering.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, March 12, the&#160;<a href="http://ias.ucsc.edu"><strong><em>Institute of the Arts and Sciences</em></strong></a> at UC Santa Cruz will bring its local LASER&#8212;now in its sixth year of quarterly talks on campus&#8212;downtown for a special evening at the Rio Theater in Santa Cruz, beginning at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>The Rio event will include presentations by four UC Santa Cruz professors: theater and opera director <strong>Marianne Weems</strong><span><strong>&#160;</strong></span><em>(</em><em>&#8220;&#8217;Liveness&#8217; in a Digital World"</em>),<span>&#160;</span>astrophysicist <strong>Alexie Leauthaud</strong><span>&#160;</span>(&#8220;<em>Journey to a Universe of Darkness</em><em>"</em>), poet <strong>Ronaldo Wilson</strong> (&#8220;<em>Persona, Melody, Mask), </em>and documentary filmmaker <strong>Jennifer</strong> <strong>Maytorena Taylor</strong> (<em>"</em><em>Beyond Red and Blue, Documentary Storytelling in Polarized Times")</em>.</p>
<p>Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to be bringing our next Leonardo Art/Science Evening Rendezvous to Santa Cruz--this time in the Rio Theater--to give people a look at some of the work being done by faculty on campus,&#8221; said John Weber, founding director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences.<span>&#160;</span><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;For the Rio, we have an incredibly rich program of work by UC Santa Cruz faculty, whose research is nationally and internationally renowned,&#8221; Weber added. &#8220;This is a chance to look into the minds of the creators and scientists here, to see where their creative ideas and research come from, and find out what they are working on right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weber noted that the UC Santa Cruz LASER is one of the oldest in the region, and that LASERs have now expanded worldwide.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are more than 35 LASERs now spread across the United States, Europe, and Latin America,&#8221; said Weber. &#8220;Bringing together makers and thinkers in the arts and sciences--and drawing audiences for both areas--these LASERs encourage cross-disciplinary thinking and awareness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Theater Arts professor<strong> Marianne Weems</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>is the artistic director of the Obie award-winning, New York-based&#160;performance and media company The Builders Association--known internationally as a leader in theatrical innovation, interdisciplinary stage performance, and the use of digital technology.&#160;In addition to her 20 years of work with the company, she has also collaborated with such artists as the Wooster Group, David Byrne, Taryn Simon, and Susan Sontag.</p>
<p>Her new multi-media theater production, <em>Strange Window: The Turn of the Screw, </em>had its West Coast premiere at UC Santa Cruz in the fall of 2018, before opening at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last December as part of the Next Wave Festival.</p>
<p><strong>Alexie Leauthaud</strong> is an observational cosmologist and professor in the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department. The core of her research focuses on understanding the interplay between the dark and bright universe. Her research areas include dark matter and galaxy formation; the distribution of dark matter in the universe; and the evolution of dark energy.</p>

Sloan Fellow, and has received fellowships at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and the Kavli Institute for Physics and Mathematics of the Universe in Toyko. Her work is also supported by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy Office of Science Early Career Research Program Award.&#160;</p>
<p>Associate Professor of&#160;literature <strong>Ronaldo&#160;Wilson</strong> is the author of<span>&#160;</span><em>Narrative of the Life of the Brown Boy and the White Man</em>, which received the 2007 Cave Canem Poetry Prize;<span>&#160;</span><em>Poems of the Black Object</em>, winner of the 2010 Asian American Literary Award and the Thom Gunn Award for Gay Poetry;<span>&#160;</span><em>Farther Traveler</em>, and<span>&#160;</span><em>Lucy 72</em>.</p>
<p>Co-founder of the Black Took Collective,&#160;Wilson&#160;is also a mixed media artist, dancer, and performer, and additionally is on the core faculty of the Creative Critical Ph.D. Program, and co-director of the Creative Writing Program. He has served as as an artist-in-residence at the Headlands Center for the Arts, and the Center for Art and Thought CA+T).</p>
<p>Associate professor of film and digital media <strong>Jennifer Maytorena Taylor</strong> is now at work on a new feature documentary, <em>The Gut</em>. Set in a small blue-collar city recovering from an opioid epidemic, the film follows the mayor and a small ensemble of intersecting characters for two years as he fights to resettle Syrian refugees in the town. She is currently raising money to support her documentary-in-progress, and just received a $100,000 extension of a $125,000 production grant from Just/Films at the Ford Foundation.</p>
<p>Taylor&#8217;s award-winning work has been shown at the Sundance, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Locarno Film Festivals, as well as the New York Museum of Modern Art, and has been broadcast on PBS, Sundance Channel, Al Jazeera, and NHK-Japan. She produced one of several short pieces that comprised&#160;<em>The Talk: Race in America</em>, a film that premiered on&#160;PBS in 2017, and her recent project,<span>&#160;</span><em>Redneck Muslim</em>, was one of 25 films featured in the<span>&#160;</span><em>2018 PBS Online Film Festiva</em>l<span><strong>&#160;</strong></span>as a presentation of the PBS series<span> </span><em>POV</em>.</p>

<p>Beginning at 7 p.m., his performance is part of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences&#8217; ongoing<span>&#160;</span><em>TRACTION: Art Talks</em><span><em>&#160;</em></span>series<strong>. </strong></p>
<p>Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>A performance artist, writer, activist, and director of the performance troupe La Pocha Nostra,&#160;G&#243;mez-Pe&#241;a was born and raised in Mexico City and came to the U.S. in 1978.</p>
<p>His work includes performance audio, installations, poetry, and journalism--exploring cross-cultural issues, immigration, the politics of language, &#8220;extreme culture,&#8221; and new technologies. Critics have described his multi-centric narratives and border projects as "Chicano cyber-punk performances," and "ethno-techno art."</p>
<p>In 1991, G&#243;mez-Pe&#241;a became the first Chicano artist to receive a MacArthur &#8220;Genius&#8221; Fellowship.</p>
<p>In 1995, he was included in<span>&#160;</span><em>The UTNE Reader&#8217;</em>s "List of 100 Visionaries." In 1997 he received the American Book Award for<span>&#160;</span><em>The New World Border</em>. And in 2000, he received the Cineaste lifetime achievement award from the Taos Talking Pictures film festival.</p>
<p>A regular contributor to National Public Radio&#8217;s<span>&#160;</span><em>All Things Considered</em>, G&#243;mez-Pe&#241;a is also a writer for newspapers and magazines in the U.S., Mexico, and Europe, and is a contributing editor to<span>&#160;</span><em>The Drama Review </em>(NYU-MIT).</p>
<p>G&#243;mez-Pe&#241;a&#8217;s performance work and 11 books have contributed to debates on cultural diversity, border culture, and U.S.-Mexico relations for nearly three decades. His art work has been presented at more than 900 venues across the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe, Russia, South Africa, and Australia.</p>
<p>As G&#243;mez-Pe&#241;a once told<span>&#160;</span><em>Art Practical</em>, an online magazine that covers contemporary art and visual culture in the San Francisco Bay area: &#8220;I believe in the sophistication of the human condition. I believe that performance art is such a visceral art form that it allows for multiple points of entry&#8212;some are intellectual, but some are spiritual or emotional.&#8221;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s fourth-annual <span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/">Giving Day</a></span>, an adrenaline-fueled online philanthropic festival, shattered records this year, with fundraisers kicking in more than $665,000, and a record-breaking 7,000 gifts for 175 projects.<span>&#160; </span></p>
<p>In comparison, last year&#8217;s Giving Day yielded around $600,000 in donations with 6,300 gifts for 160 projects, according to preliminary tallies. A pattern seems to be emerging; every year, donors and teams keep stepping up their gain, with more projects participating, more donors kicking in funds, and more money for teams.</p>
<p>Giving Day aims to nurture and expand UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s culture of philanthropy, said Howard Heevner, &#160;assistant vice chancellor for University Development Programs, who is teaching a practicum course to undergraduate students that teaches the basics of fundraising including making your case, finding your advocates, and learning how to market your project.This course allows students to test what they learned with Giving Day, all for the sake of helping their UC Santa Cruz community.</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span>&#8220;Giving Day is a project that touches nearly all of us in one way or another,&#8221; Heevner said. &#8220;It is a lot of work, but the value of Giving Day is much greater than the dollars these donors give -- it is the new donors we meet, it is the volunteers who are out fundraising on our behalf, it is the dozens of celebrations across campus on Giving Day promoting philanthropy. On this one day, there are thousands of people participating in creating a stronger UC Santa Cruz culture of philanthropy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though most of the activity took place online, Quarry Plaza was abuzz with activity throughout Giving Day, in spite of the gusty weather and occasional spatters of rain. Donors were pumping their fists, jumping up and down, wearing fuzzy Sammy the Slug hats, and posing for instant GIFs, which they posted online in between handing over cash or checks to their favorite projects.</p>
<p>Francia Cruz (Oakes, sociology, &#8217;20) was out raising funds and awareness for Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students (STARS), which is piloting a subsidized meal plan for transfer students who are parents, a wellness program for veteran students, and a professional development scholarship fund and career internship program aimed at transfers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel very happy because (Giving Day) lets me help students like me,&#8221; said Cruz, who transferred from East Los Angeles College to UC Santa Cruz.<span>&#160; </span>&#8220;Transfer students are only here two years. We have to do everything really quickly. Finding resources can be a challenge. STARS helps out a lot with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several groups were out tabling in the Quarry Plaza including the Don Rothman Dream Fund, which supports undocumented UC Santa Cruz students, including assistance with housing and textbooks as well as emotional and physical health, and the Gravitational Wave Astrophysics team of UC Santa Cruz, which is raising funds to send new undergraduates to Lick Observatory so they can make observations, analyze data, and make new discoveries about the universe.</p>
<p>As usual, Giving Day used an appealing and accessible format to keep the gifts rolling in; the contest pitted teams of donors against one another in a good-natured sprint to the finish line, with the tension building as the clock wound down to the midnight deadline. Donors and curious onlookers could look at the<span>&#160;</span><span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/">interactive and constantly updated Giving Day website</a></span><span>&#160;</span>and track the results in real time.</p>
<p>Every gift was tallied, ranging from online pledges to pocket change to large checks.<span>&#160; </span></p>
<p>Matches, created by donors, created strong incentives to give. &#8220;Challenges,&#8221; also funded by donors, pitted project teams against each other in a lighthearted way, creating bonuses for those that raised the most money in restricted time elements&#8212;from 6&#8211;8 p.m., for instance.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s top fundraisers included many familiar faces as well as a few newcomers. As of Friday, the Okinawa Memories Initiative raised the most funds, with 418 supporters kicking in $29,714. The Initiative, formerly the Gail Project, is designed to help undergraduate and graduate researchers gain valuable out-of-classroom experience from professionals while advocating Okinawan history. Proceeds from last year&#8217;s Giving Day helped the Initiative send a group to Okinawa to capture the stories of many local people.</p>
<p>STEM diversity programs also triumphed on this year&#8217;s Giving Day, raising more than $23,000 with 333 supporters, making them &#8220;Campaign Heroes.&#8221; &#160;The program promotes diversity in the sciences by providing direct services that support students through STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) research training, professional development, and academic support. The program supports underrepresented and underserved students, helping them to achieve their educational and career goals by giving them access to hands-on research experience and fostering a sense of inclusion, acceptance, and community.&#160;STEM Diversity Programs has mentored more than 1,500 students over the past 35 years, with a strong record of 155 Ph.D. students in STEM fields.</p>
<p>The Pilipino Cultural Celebration, an annual production under the student organization Bayanihan, also received an impressive outpouring of support, with 346 supporters and more than $17,000 raised.</p>

<p>&#8220;To have no gap in a class is an amazing achievement,&#8221; said Jaye Padgett, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s vice provost for student success. &#8220;We&#8217;re a federally designated Hispanic-serving institution, which means not only that we serve an underrepresented community, but also that we have a philosophy of equity in our teaching practices. Professor Larrabee is manifesting that philosophy. We&#8217;re trying to eliminate gaps and get everyone the best education they can have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larrabee, a professor of computer science and engineering and associate dean for undergraduate affairs in the Baskin School of Engineering, teaches <em>Applied Discrete Mathematics</em> (CE16), a prerequisite for some of the most sought-after majors available to UCSC students, including computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering.</p>
<p>The material in her class can be grueling, and the large lecture format (approximately 400 students are enrolled in her class) is intimidating for some students. Scoring below a C means a student must halt progress in his or her major to repeat the class or switch majors to something else. Passing offers tremendous opportunities: Graduates of UC Santa Cruz engineering programs routinely land good jobs in the Santa Cruz and Silicon Valley tech industry and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Three-pronged approach</strong></p>
<p>Larrabee credits valuable support from two on-campus tutoring programs, the Academic Excellence Program (ACE) and Modified Supplemental Instruction (MSI), and says she uses a three-pronged approach to support underrepresented students in her class.</p>
<p>"The first is that we have had a very diverse teaching staff," she said. "We have one professor, four TAs and four MSI tutors, and during this time it just happened that of those people, half were female, we always had at least one African American, one Latinx, and one non-gender conforming tutor so that everyone could feel a connection to someone on the teaching staff."</p>
<p>&#8220;Another technique I use is to emphasize failure as the appropriate path to learning,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Engineering is hard; it&#8217;s <em>good</em> to fail the first time you attempt a problem. People who fail at a problem the first time tend to retain things better than those who luck into the right answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>In practice this means she won&#8217;t take points off on the homework for coming up with the wrong answer. &#8220;You just have to try,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But those problems will probably show up on the weekly quiz that is graded, so it&#8217;s your responsibility to learn how to do them.&#8221;</p>
<p>To help them do this, Larrabee makes it as easy as possible to get help, even for introverted students. She peppers her course websites with videoed lectures and links to Khan Academy and other sources of outside help. She also makes herself available. &#8220;I have plenty of conversation with my students, I keep four online forums going, and try to write to them as much as I can,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><strong>Stereotype threat</strong></p>
<p>Her final tactic is to explicitly discuss stereotype threat. This is the risk that someone (i.e., from an underrepresented minority) might take routine negative experiences as confirmation that they are fundamentally unsuited for something like higher education.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of my African American MSI tutors&#8212;who are extremely high achieving students selected to provide supplemental tutoring to others&#8212;told me it was like having a light bulb go off for him,&#8221; Larrabee said. &#8221;Until I discussed the issue in class, he felt like he didn&#8217;t belong in this major, but after we talked about stereotypes, he realized it wasn&#8217;t that he was unsuited for the material. It was hard for everyone!&#8221;</p>
<p>Vice Provost Padgett agrees stereotype threat is a huge issue. &#8220;Grade sensitivity, for example, is a big problem. Some populations are predisposed to take things differently. The danger is that you fail your exam and instead of thinking it&#8217;s a sign you need to spend more time studying, you take it as confirmation that you&#8217;re in the wrong place and you drop out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Baskin School of Engineering has had other successes in bringing disadvantaged populations closer to parity. The Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP), which serves approximately 281 of the school&#8217;s 4,234 declared undergraduate majors, has closed the gap significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a strong statistical significance difference between the GPAs of MEP and non-MEP first-generation college students,&#8221; MEP Director Lydia Zendejas said. &#8220;The average GPA of first-generation, non-MEP students is 2.90 and the average GPA of MEP students is 3.14."</p>
<p>Larrabee has a few other teaching tricks too.</p>
<p>&#8220;In debugging there&#8217;s a concept called &#8216;rubber duck debugging,&#8217; where you get a duck, place it on the terminal and explain things to it out loud in very simple terms, and you often come to the right conclusion&#8230; which is to say that teaching one another really helps the learning process. I also try to be as approachable as I can,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I describe the failures I had as a student, and I&#8217;m mildly outrageous in class&#8212;it helps break the ice and break up the monotony; they&#8217;ll laugh, and if they&#8217;re awake they&#8217;ll learn and will feel more comfortable coming to me or one of the TAs with questions.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Teaching councils</strong></p>
<p>Larrabee has also made use of many of the interdisciplinary teaching councils on campus such as the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning (CITL), which provided reinforcement for Larrabee's emphasis on stereotype threat and helped her to incorporate more active learning techniques into her lecture style.</p>
<p>Some other insights she&#8217;s found helpful: &#8220;People need to use their bodies to learn,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Handwriting is a different neurological thing than typing. It gives people time to process what they&#8217;re learning while they&#8217;re writing, So I make sure that all my homework is handwritten and, when I lecture, I make nice slides and I use a stylus to scribble all over them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larrabee is currently putting together a proposal for the National Science Foundation's Revolutionary Educational Design program that will attempt to replicate her success by proposing a series of interventions to keep STEM students on track and enmeshed.</p>
<p>Larrabee says she became a professor to help increase the representation of women in academia. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been teaching for 29 years,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Only recently have I closed my equity gap. I&#8217;ve been constantly working to improve: CITL&#8217;s help and the CITL community have really helped me incorporate more active learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a long way to go, but perhaps a path to parity is emerging.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5a1d7e8f80727017244b86d9c3c7b1c9"><name>alumniweekend</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Return of the Slugs</title><summary>Alumni Weekend 2019 is just around the corner.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Slugs, it&#8217;s time&#8212;time to check in with friends, book those plane tickets, jump on Travelocity, snap up hotel rooms, and make plans to get on the road. Time to get in touch with that old flame or former roommate. Time to return to the place where you belong. Alumni Weekend 2019 is just around the corner.&#160;</p>
<p>Activities will take place from Friday, April 26, through Sunday, April 28.</p>
<p>The festivities kick off on Friday with, among other things, the annual&#160;<a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/graduate_research_symposium#.XIAViC2ZPq0">Graduate Research Symposium,</a>a&#160;<a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/physics_open_house#.XIAVPy2ZPq0">Physics Open House,&#160;</a>and a chance to see&#160;<a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/anthropology_film_screening_road_to_zuni_with_annapurna_pandey#.XIAVVC2ZPq0">a moving documentary&#160;</a>about&#160;Professor Emeritus Triloki Pandey&#8217;s work with the Zuni Tribe of New Mexico.&#160;</p>
<p>However, the schedule really kicks into high gear on Saturday,&#160;when attendees will get to pick and choose from the wide array of offerings, including a chance to lace up your running shoes once again and start off the day with a&#160;<a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/third_annual_5k_fun_run#.XIAV4y2ZPq0">5K Fun Run&#160;</a>benefiting student scholarships.&#160;</p>
<p>One of the day&#8217;s highlights is a special ceremony celebrating the life of&#160;<a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/recreation_recollections_local_adventures_and_environmental_stewardship#.XIAWAC2ZPq0">Nik Madsen</a>, a recent Recreation Program leader and wilderness orientation instructor who died in 2018.&#160;Attendees will share Madsen&#8217;s connection to the campus and his passion for the environment. The day will also include a number of important landmark celebrations, including&#160;<a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/50th_anniversary_celebration_and_makers_fair#.XIAXIi2ZPq0">Porter College&#8217;s 50th anniversary and makers fair.</a></p>
<p>On Saturday, returning Slugs can take in a fascinating talk about &#8220;<a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/high_impact_science_from_pbsci#.XIAbDC2ZPq0">high-impact science</a>&#8221; with an all-star group of UC Santa Cruz Physics &amp; Biological Sciences faculty who are also alumni. Among the presenters are Natalie Batalha (Ph.D., &#8216;97, astrophysics), winner of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 2018 Alumni Achievement Award, who will talk about &#8220;Earth and the Cosmos,&#8221; associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Kristy Kroeker (Crown, &#8216;01, marine biology), who will discuss &#8220;Life and the Environment,&#8221; and assistant professor of MCD biology Olena Morozova Vaske (postdoc, 2013-2016, biomolecular engineering) who will bring the audience up to date on &#8220;Next-Generation Medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saturday will also include&#160;a rare opportunity to see a beloved campus rock band reunite.&#160;<a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/flowers_of_evil_concert#.XIAYBC2ZPq0">The Flowers of Evil</a>, consisting of members of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s pioneer class, will rock out once again during an evening concert at Stevenson Event Center.&#160;</p>
<p>This rock concert announcement just might bring flashbacks to those of you who remember watching these fellows make some noise out on East Field five decades ago. If you search the internet, it&#8217;s easy to find vintage black-and-white photos of UC Santa Cruz students with bushy hairdos and wild outfits dancing up a storm to this band.</p>
<p>&#8220;They all live in different areas now,&#8221; said Alumni Weekend coordinator Diana Hogue, referring to the Flowers of Evil. &#8220;This might be their last hurrah.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>As you can tell from this range of attractions, Alumni Weekend has a &#8220;festival vibe&#8221; this year.&#160;</p>
<p>Part of the strong appeal of Alumni Weekend derives from the &#8220;come one, come all&#8221; aspect of this annual gathering. This celebration certainly has a few things in common with traditional college reunions, but it also transcends the rules of those traditional gatherings.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz alumni don&#8217;t necessarily identify with their specific graduation year,&#8221; Hogue said. &#8220;It&#8217;s more affinity-based&#8212;their major, the college they were in. It is not just the people you graduated with. It&#8217;s larger than that. We&#8217;re a young university, so we&#8217;re not held to 100-year-old traditions. We&#8217;re working to build new traditions and momentum.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Make no mistake. Rituals can be comforting. Returning Slugs will be glad to know that many of the features that made Alumni Weekend 2018 a hit with attendees will be back once again, including the ever popular&#160;<a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/the_lunchbox_annual_banana_slug_lunch#.XIAXaC2ZPq0">Annual Banana Slug Lunch</a>, though this year&#8217;s version will have an enticing new twist; attendees will be able to choose from&#160;a gourmet carry-out box lunch or tacos from a taco truck.&#160;</p>
<p>Revelers will enjoy these foods at a table Quarry Plaza, or&#160;do a &#8220;grab and go&#8221; as they head to a lunch hour event.&#160;Banana Slug Kid Zone, a fun and creative craft area for the kids, will also be back in action. Returning Slugs will also flock to the annual&#160;<a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/annual_beer_wine_reception#.XIAZ-S2ZPq0">Beer and Wine Reception&#160;</a>at the recently refurbished and reopened Quarry Amphitheater at 4 p.m. on Saturday, April 27.&#160;</p>
<p>Among the other highlights will be a Saturday talk entitled&#160;<strong><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/radical_learning_the_heart_of_the_ucsc_experience#.XIAaRC2ZPq0">&#8220;</a></strong><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/radical_learning_the_heart_of_the_ucsc_experience#.XIAaRC2ZPq0">Radical Learning: The Heart of the UC Santa Cruz Experience,&#8221;&#160;</a>taking a look at the bold and radical educational vision of UC Santa Cruz since its inception, while introducing alumni to the innovative 21st-century approaches the campus is taking to ensure all students can thrive and leave with the tools to make change in society. Participants will give brief &#8220;lightning talks&#8221; on what it takes for students to be outstanding learners in our 21st-century university.&#160;</p>
<p>A very special edition of the annual Dizikes Concert honoring founding faculty member John Dizikes will be held on Sunday. This year&#8217;s concert will be extra poignant as attendants honor the memory of Dizikes,&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/01/dizikes-obituary.html">who died last year</a>.</p>

<p>Titled "Feminism and Social Justice" it is an adaptation of a popular course taught on campus for nearly a decade by Distinguished Professor of Feminist Studies Bettina Aptheker.</p>
<p>The condensed, four-lecture course critically examines three significant post World War II movements for social justice in the United States from feminist perspectives--considering how participants in these movements thought about race, gender, and class; how they organized; and what progressive changes may have resulted from their efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I begin by explaining what social justice is, how feminism may be defined, and how experiences of gender, race, class, and sexuality affect everyone, regardless of their particular identity, because these are embedded in our social and political structures of&#160;inequality,&#8221; said Aptheker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then in the next class, I talk about a strike in 1951 by Mexican American zinc miners in New Mexico that is enshrined in the classic film, <em>Salt of the Earth, </em>and how women and men finally worked together to win the strike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the third lecture, I discuss the Free Angela Davis movement (1969-1972) and how it became a huge international effort involving literally hundreds of thousands of people, led in the first place by Black people in the United States,&#8221; she added. "And the final lecture is on the #ME Too Movement, discussing rape, sexual harassment, and political power.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Aptheker taught for four decades at UC Santa Cruz until she retired in 2018. A scholar of history with a national reputation for her talents as an instructor, she also taught one of the country&#8217;s largest and most influential introductory feminist studies courses for nearly three decades at the campus.</p>
<p>Aptheker is the inaugural appointee to the Jack and Peggy Baskin Foundation Presidential Chair for Feminist Studies at UC Santa Cruz, and previously held a UC Presidential Chair in Feminist Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies.</p>
<p>She is also the author of a number of books, including <em>The Morning Breaks: The Trial of Angela Davis</em>, and <em>Intimate Politics: How I Grew Up Red, Fought for Free Speech and Became a Feminist Rebel</em>.</p>
<p>Apthker noted that it was her intention to teach the new online course in a way that was accessible to all, and said she used&#160;storytelling as a main way for illustrating the&#160;interconnection between gender, race, class, and sexuality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to make it enjoyable and also a little suspenseful, so folks would know that struggles can be demanding, but that we can also win them,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In these very trying and challenging times when I feel our constitutional&#160;democracy is in deep&#160;jeopardy, I felt that it might be&#160;useful for people to see how social movements for justice and feminist principles can be organized and how community and loving kindness can be created as people come together,&#8221; Aptheker added.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tons of rocks, soil, and trees swept through her parent&#8217;s hillside house, killing Kuttner&#8217;s mother, Eliza, while she slept and tossing her father, Michael, who was in the bathtub, into the maelstrom. He survived but suffered permanent brain injuries, according to Kuttner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slide came after several days of extreme rain, and while Kuttner, a Ph.D. student in astrophysics in&#160;<span>the Physics Department&#160;</span>at UC Santa Cruz, said she can&#8217;t specifically blame the disaster on climate change, she&#8217;s seen the devastating effects of recent wildfires, hurricanes, and floods that have been sparked by the Earth&#8217;s warming. &#160;She couldn&#8217;t just sit by, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Kuttner, 28, is not only finishing her Ph.D. thesis but also running as a Green Party candidate for a seat in Canada&#8217;s 338-member House of Commons in order to help make policy for the changes we are facing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her platform includes a push to have municipalities prepare better for disasters, to strengthen social safety nets for people whose jobs are eliminated because of automation, to establish a guaranteed livable income, and to create policy to deal with the changes coming because of leaps in artificial intelligence technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love to do astrophysics,&#8221; she said by telephone from her home in a suburb of Vancouver, &#8220;but right now we have to save the planet so that we can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> astrophysics.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuttner said she has been fascinated by the universe and the nature of time since she was a young girl and that she pointed herself toward the sciences early on. She was 14 and attending the private Mount Madonna School in the hills above Watsonville, Calif., when the slide struck her home. If she hadn&#8217;t been away at boarding school, she said, she would most likely have become another victim of the slide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disaster left her with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression, she said. Yet, she graduated from high school and eventually landed at UC Santa Cruz, where she completed her bachelor&#8217;s degree in physics in 2013 and received a master&#8217;s in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the College Nine grad, her time at UC Santa Cruz not only led her to a study of black holes, which is the focus of her thesis, but also birthed her activism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The climate of the university is such that we are encouraged to not take the world for what it is but to challenge the status quo,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuttner led the Women in Physics and Astronomy group on campus; learned about pushing back against outdated institutional policy; and spent hours in conversation with her adviser, Professor of Physics Anthony Aguirre, on big-picture topics that ranged from climate change to artificial intelligence. Aguirre is also associate director of the Foundational Questions Institute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, according to her, Donald Trump was elected president and she felt she could no longer focus only on her science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was sitting in my adviser&#8217;s office, crying because I felt so powerless, and never before then had I ever wanted power,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But when I felt powerless to do anything I thought, &#8216;I can&#8217;t stand this. I can&#8217;t see something unjust and not want to change it.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuttner went north to work on her Ph.D. and announce her Green Party candidacy. She will defend her thesis in May. The election is Oct. 21.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s very easy to feel hopeless about the magnitude of the problems we face and how much we&#8217;re heading in the wrong direction,&#8221; Aguirre said. &#8220;But if you give in to that despair there&#8217;s no way those problems will be solved. Amita has taken that truth to heart, and chosen to be motivated rather than devastated. That&#8217;s a wonderful thing to see and gives me hope as well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuttner said her campaign is very people centered. She believes that municipalities need to better prepare for the extreme weather that is coming by making sure people are ready, that communities can be resilient. She also believes government must address the root causes of people&#8217;s inability to make a decent living and also provide a guaranteed livable income, especially as jobs are lost because of automation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advances in artificial intelligence also make government policy changes necessary, she said. She plans to set up a think tank centered on issues around AI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But whether she wins the election or not, Kuttner said, she will continue to work on these issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The intention is bigger than the means,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In the end, it doesn&#8217;t matter how things get accomplished. I&#8217;ll just try another way.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/03/images/amita-kuttner-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/03/images/amita-kuttner-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>amita-kuttner-featured.jpg</name><file-size>16306</file-size><width>500</width><height>241</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Amita Kuttner</thumb-alt><title>Leading the charge for change</title><description>Alumna Amita Kuttner, a current graduate student in astrophysics, is running as a Green Party candidate for a seat in Canada’s House of Commons in order to make policy around climate change.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6e14ff5080727017244b86d90fb114c9"><name>speech-therapy-game</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Smile Train partners with UC Santa Cruz researchers on speech therapy game</title><summary>Designed to support speech therapy for children after reconstructive surgery for cleft lip and cleft palate, SpokeIt uses game play to make speech therapy fun.</summary><start-date>1552287600000</start-date><display-name>Smile Train partners with UC Santa Cruz researchers on speech therapy game</display-name><path>/2019/03/speech-therapy-game</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/03/speech-therapy-game</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1552330062822</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1552331557299</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computational Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><br/><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="231" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e2oBbTzXZ9g" width="410"></iframe></embed><width>410</width><caption>SpokeIt uses game play to make speech therapy fun.</caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/03/images/speech-therapy-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/03/images/speech-therapy-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>speech-therapy-400.jpg</name><display-name>speech-therapy-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>82365</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>speech therapist with child</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/03/images/spokeit-graphic-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/03/images/spokeit-graphic-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>spokeit-graphic-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>spokeit-graphic-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20874</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>SpokeIt logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Speech therapy is an important part of follow-up care after reconstructive surgery for cleft lip or cleft palate.

<p>Globally, one in every 700 babies is born with a cleft, one of the most common birth defects. Speech therapy is an important part of follow-up care after reconstructive surgery for cleft lip and palate. The availability of trained speech therapists is limited, however, especially in developing countries. <em>SpokeIt</em> has the potential to greatly improve access to this essential therapy.</p>
<p>"We are really invested in making sure this doesn't just sit on the shelf, but is made available to people who can benefit from it. That's why we are so excited to be partnering with Smile Train," said Sri Kurniawan, professor of computational media in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Smile Train supports free cleft surgery and comprehensive cleft care for children in over 85 countries around the world through partnerships with local hospitals. Their global network of experts in cleft care will help assess <em>SpokeIt</em> and improve its effectiveness, especially as the UCSC team translates the game into additional languages. Smile Train also has a network that can get the game into the hands of those who need it.</p>
<p>"There is tremendous need for follow-up care after cleft surgery, so we are thrilled about working together on this project," said Pamela Sheeran, vice president of comprehensive cleft care at Smile Train. "<em>SpokeIt</em> can help children to improve their speech after cleft palate surgery by making speech therapy part of a fun activity."</p>
<p>"The work Smile Train is doing with children around the world is truly inspiring," said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. "We're honored to partner with them and see first hand how the application of engineering concepts can help improve lives."</p>
<p><strong>Sharing expertise and experience</strong></p>
<p>UCSC graduate student Jared Duval has been leading the development of <em>SpokeIt</em> for the past three years, building on an initial prototype developed by a previous graduate student. Sheeran contacted him last year after learning about the project and offered to share Smile Train's expertise and experience with cleft palate speech therapy.</p>
<p>The feedback from Smile Train's experts has already led to new features that Duval is currently implementing, including making <em>SpokeIt</em> available for both iOS and Android devices. The next version will also support game controllers, which will enable a therapist or parent to help a child progress through the game.</p>
<p>"You don't want them to get discouraged, so a game controller makes it easy for a facilitator to provide help," Duval said.</p>
<p>Duval is also working to make <em>SpokeIt</em> available in languages other than English. Speech recognition software is available for many different languages, but adapting the speech therapy game to a new language requires updating the target words and ensuring the content is culturally appropriate, among other things. For this, Smile Train's extensive network of speech therapists in countries around the world will provide crucial expertise.</p>
<p>"I'm excited to see this research move out of the lab and start making a real impact globally on children's lives," Duval said.</p>
<p>The game play in <em>SpokeIt</em> revolves around a talking star named Nova, who is powered by speech. Nova's adventures with characters called Migs play out in a series of mini-games in which the player provides the "speech magic" and thereby practices different aspects of speech.</p>
<p>The initial idea for the speech therapy game was suggested to Kurniawan by Dr. Travis Tollefson, a surgeon at UC Davis Children's Hospital who specializes in cleft and other facial deformities. After producing a proof-of-concept prototype, Kurniawan won funding from the National Science Foundation to continue developing the game in collaboration with Dr. Tollefson's team. His patients were the first "beta testers" for <em>SpokeIt</em>.</p>
<p>Now, the researchers are focusing on implementing new features, adding new languages, and developing the game into a downloadable app that they can make available online. "Our vision is to eventually make the game available in app stores, where it will automatically download with the appropriate language based on location," Duval said.</p>
<p>Smile Train has been working for years to expand access to cleft palate speech therapy for all children in need, Sheeran said. These efforts include training programs for speech therapists and community health workers, and financial assistance to cover the costs of therapy.</p>
<p>"In many communities where Smile Train has programs there are no, or very few, speech therapists trained specifically in cleft palate speech therapy," Sheeran said. "Most children born with clefts do not have access to this essential service."</p>
<p>To put the scale of need into perspective, she said, it is estimated that more than 200,000 babies are born each year with a cleft, and many born in previous years are still waiting for care. <em>SpokeIt</em> could go a long way toward meeting this need by using game technology to deliver speech therapy in a way that is both cost-effective and easy to scale up to serve large numbers of users.</p>

<p>Depending on the number of drivers that report to work, TAPS may be able to run a minimal level of shuttle service, and a limited number of smaller, volunteer-based vehicles will be on-hand to supplement this service. Other options include Lyft, Uber, <a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/commute-options/zipcar.html">Zipcars</a>, <a href="https://jump.com/cities/santa-cruz/">JUMP</a> bikes, providing or sharing a ride with a friend or connecting with someone through <a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/commute-options/zimride.html">Zimride</a>, biking, or walking when able.</p>
<p>We anticipate that METRO routes serving the campus will drop passengers off at the base of campus only and will then detour around the Bay/High intersection, with buses laying-over on Meder and Cardiff streets to maintain their regular service schedules.</p>

<p>The office, led by Title IX Officer Isabel Dees, has six staff members, including, an assistant director, three full-time investigators, and a response team coordinator.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has focused on expanding the office in the last several years after seeing a sharp increase in the number of reports of sexual harassment and sexual violence. Dees attributes the increase to more people being willing to come forward rather than an increase in the number of incidents.</p>
<p>The Title IX Office completed all investigations from the 2017&#8211;18 academic year before the first day of fall 2018 instruction. Additionally, the office completed all investigation that were initiated in fall 2018 in compliance with time requirements in the policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could not do this work without dedicated people who are driven by educational equity and inclusion, and committed to stewarding a fair and neutral process,&#8221; Dees said. &#8220;Being fully staffed will help ensure we are responsive, thorough, and timely in our investigations as well as engaged members of the UCSC community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new staff members are:</p>

An expert panel has now published a comprehensive assessment of the available science on how noise exposure affects hearing in marine mammals, providing scientific recommendations for noise exposure criteria that could have far-reaching regulatory implications.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1578/AM.45.2.2019.125">Published March 12 in <em>Aquatic Mammals</em></a>, the paper is a major revision of the first such assessment, published in 2007 in the same journal. Both efforts were led by Brandon Southall, a research associate at the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz and senior scientist at Southall Environmental Associates.</p>
<p>"One of the things we did in 2007 was to identify major gaps in our knowledge, and we now have considerably more data. We thought there was enough new science to reconvene the panel and revisit these issues," said Southall, who served as director of NOAA's Ocean Acoustics Program from 2004 to 2009.</p>
<p>Concern about the potential for ocean noise to cause hearing damage or behavioral changes in marine mammals began to mount in the 1990s, focusing initially on activities related to the oil and gas industry. In the early 2000s, the association of sonar with mass strandings of deep-diving whales became another focus of concern. Shipping and construction activities are other important sources of ocean noise pollution.</p>
<p>Loud noises can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss, can mask other sounds, and can disturb animals in various ways. The new paper focuses on direct effects of noise pollution on hearing in marine mammals. Separate papers addressing behavioral effects and the acoustics of different sound sources will be published later this year.</p>
<p>"Noise-induced hearing loss occurs in animals the same way it does in humans. You can have a short-term change in response to exposure to loud noise, and you can also have long-term changes, usually as a result of repeated insults," said coauthor Colleen Reichmuth, a research scientist who leads the Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Laboratory at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>All living species</strong></p>
<p>Because animals vary in their sensitivities to different types and frequencies of sound, the panel categorized marine mammal species into groups based on what was known about their hearing. The new paper includes all living species of marine mammals.</p>
<p>"The diversity of species is such that a one-size-fits-all approach isn't going to work," said coauthor Darlene Ketten, a neuro-anatomist with joint appointments at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and Boston University's Hearing Research Center. "We need to understand how to avoid harm, and the aim is to provide guidelines to say, if this or that species is in your area, here's what you need to avoid."</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the number of scientific studies on hearing in marine mammals has grown rapidly, enabling the panel to refine and improve its groupings and assessments. Accompanying the paper is a set of appendices compiling all the relevant information for 129 species of marine mammals.</p>
<p>"We did a comprehensive review, species by species, for all living marine mammals," said Reichmuth, who led the work on the appendices. "We pulled together the available knowledge covering all aspects of hearing, sound sensitivity, anatomy, and sound production. That's the scientific basis for the species groupings used in the noise exposure criteria."</p>
<p>"The appendices are a really important resource that does not exist anywhere else," Southall said. "The 2007 paper was the most impactful single paper I've ever published--it's been cited in the literature more times than all my other papers combined--and I expect this new paper will have a similar impact."</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory guidance</strong></p>
<p>The 2007 paper covered only those species under the jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries). NOAA Fisheries issued U.S. regulatory guidance in 2016 and 2018 based on the 2007 paper and a 2016 Navy technical report by James Finneran, a researcher at the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program in San Diego and a coauthor of both papers.</p>
<p>In addition to covering all marine mammals for the first time, the new paper also addresses the effects of both airborne and underwater noise on amphibious species in coastal environments, such as sea lions. According to Southall, publishing the new noise exposure criteria along with a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge in a peer-reviewed journal is a major step forward.</p>
<p>"There are regulatory agencies around the world that are thirsting for this kind of guidance," Southall said. "There are still holes where we need more data, but we've made some big strides."</p>
<p>Research on seals, sea lions, and sea otters at the UCSC Pinniped Lab now run by Reichmuth has provided much of the new data on hearing in amphibious marine mammals. Working with trained animals at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory, Reichmuth's team is able to conduct controlled experiments and perform hearing tests similar to those used to study human hearing.</p>
<p>Finneran's program in San Diego and coauthor Paul Nachtigall's program at the University of Hawaii have provided much of the data for dolphins and other cetaceans.</p>
<p>But some marine mammals, such as baleen whales and other large whales, simply can't be held in a controlled environment where researchers could conduct hearing tests. That's where Ketten's research comes in. Ketten uses biomedical imaging techniques, including CT and MRI, to study the auditory systems of a wide range of species.</p>
<p>"Modeling an animal's hearing based on the anatomy of its auditory system is a very well-established technique that can be applied to baleen whales," Ketten explained. "We also do this modeling for the species that we can test in captivity, and that enables us to hone the models and make sure they're accurate. There has been a lot of resistance to modeling, but it's the only way to study hearing in some of the species with the greatest potential for harm from human sounds."</p>
<p>Southall said he regularly hears from people around the world looking for guidance on regulating noise production by activities ranging from wind farm construction to seismic surveys. "This paper has significant international implications for regulation of noise in the ocean," he said.</p>
<p>In addition to Southall, Reichmuth, Ketten, Finneran, and Nachtigall, the coauthors include Ann Bowles at Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute in San Diego; William Ellison at Marine Acoustics in Middletown, Rhode Island; Douglas Nowacek at Duke University; and Peter Tyack at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and University of St. Andrews, Scotland. The panel received financial support for travel and meeting costs from the IOGP Sound and Marine Life Program of the Joint Industry Programme.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7dd5187880727017244b86d97a80e700"><name>assembling-life</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book by biochemist David Deamer explores the origins of life</title><summary>'Assembling Life' proposes a novel theory, based on Deamer's research, of how life can begin on Earth and other planets.</summary><start-date>1552546800000</start-date><display-name>New book by biochemist David Deamer explores the origins of life</display-name><path>/2019/03/assembling-life</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/03/assembling-life</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1552594310435</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1552594638998</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Publications</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/03/images/cover-362.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/03/images/cover-362.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-362.jpg</name><display-name>cover-362.jpg</display-name><file-size>64443</file-size><width>362</width><height>550</height></image><image-alt>book cover</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/03/images/cover-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/03/images/cover-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cover-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15142</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>book cover</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/03/images/david-deamer-362.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/03/images/david-deamer-362.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>david-deamer-362.jpg</name><display-name>david-deamer-362.jpg</display-name><file-size>75684</file-size><width>362</width><height>521</height></image><image-alt>David Deamer</image-alt><image-caption>David Deamer (photo by C. Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>'Assembling Life' proposes a novel theory, based on Deamer's research, of how life can begin on Earth and other planets</article-subhead><article-text><p>In his new book, <em>Assembling Life</em>, David Deamer challenges the consensus that life began in the ocean and presents an alternative scenario, based on his research, in which life began in freshwater hot springs.</p>
<p>Deamer, a research professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has been studying the origins of life since the early 1980s. <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/assembling-life-9780190646387?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>Assembling Life</em></a> (Oxford University Press, 2019) explores how life can begin on Earth and other habitable planets.</p>
<p>Since the discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents and the unusual forms of life inhabiting them, many researchers have focused on those environments as a likely site for the origin of life on Earth. But Deamer's research suggests there are significant problems with the notion that life began in salty seawater.</p>
<p>"We have proposed an alternative, which is that life began in freshwater hot springs associated with volcanic land masses that emerged from a global ocean around 4 billion years ago," Deamer said.</p>
<p>According to Deamer, the hot springs environment provides several important properties. Organic compounds delivered to Earth's surface by meteorites could accumulate in small pools and ponds. As water evaporates from those pools, a film of extremely concentrated compounds would form on the mineral surfaces.</p>
<p>"If the compounds can react, this is where it happens," Deamer said. "We have shown, both in the laboratory and in field experiments, that RNA-like polymers are synthesized from mononucleotides under these conditions. Furthermore, if lipids are present, the polymers become encapsulated to form microscopic protocells."</p>
<p>Multiple cycles of wetting and drying give the "protocells" an opportunity to become ever more complex, he said, and eventually they begin to evolve. Deamer and his colleagues have built an experimental system in his laboratory to simulate the wet-dry cycles of volcanic hot springs, and they have also conducted experiments at volcanic sites around the world, including Hawaii, Iceland, Kamchatka (in eastern Russia), New Zealand, and California's Mount Lassen.</p>
<p>"To my knowledge, no one else working on the origin of life has ventured out of the lab to see if their experiments actually work in conditions like those of the prebiotic Earth, but that's what we are doing," Deamer said.</p>
<p>His findings are relevant not only to understanding life on Earth, but also to the search for life on other planets. For example, evidence for the existence of oceans beneath the icy surfaces of Saturn's moon Enceladus and Jupiter's moon Europa have led to speculation that there may be life in those subsurface oceans. According to Deamer, however, the absence of volcanic activity and wet-dry cycles makes this unlikely.</p>
<p>Mars, however, is a different story. "We predict that over 3 billion years ago, Mars did have seas and volcanoes, just like Earth at that time. If life could begin on Earth, it could also have begun on Mars," he said.</p>
<p><em>Assembling Life</em> is Deamer's second book on the origins of life, expanding on ideas he introduced in <em>First Life,</em> published by UC Press in 2011. He served as the president of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life from 2011 to 2014.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/07/origin-life.html</url><title>Did life begin on land rather than in the sea?</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7e3cb2a580727017244b86d946bedb36"><name>gonzalez-chicano-anthology</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New anthology of essays about Chicana and Chicano art edited by arts professor Jennifer González</title><summary>"Chicano and Chicana Art: A Critical Anthology" offers an overview of the history and theory of Chicano and Chicana art from the 1960s to the mid-2000s.&#13;

I will be teaching a course on Chicana/o art next quarter using the book for the first time.&#8221;<br/><br/>The essays in the book address a number of themes, including the politics of border life, public art practices such as posters and murals, and feminist and queer artists' figurations of Chicano/a bodies. <br/><br/>They also cover the many cultural and artistic influences, ranging from American graffiti and Mexican pre-Columbian spirituality to pop art and modernism, that have informed Chicano/a art's practice.<br/><br/>As Gonz&#225;lez notes in the book&#8217;s introduction:<br/><br/>&#8220;We hope this anthology will draw the interest of students of Chicana/o history and culture, as well as art theorists and visual studies scholars who practice in a field that has, until relatively recently, generally ignored the contribution of Chicana/o art to American and contemporary art history. <br/><br/>&#8220;What does the future hold for globally mobile citizens, refugees, Indigenous populations, and noncitizens? Are the terms &#8216;Chicano&#8217; and &#8216;Chicana&#8217; irretrievably historical and dated, or will they be taken up again, in a new way? How will marginalized populations respond creatively to ongoing, systematic economic and racial injustice? These are important concerns of our present time; they have changed little in the past fifty years since the Chicano movement was launched. Developing a response to these questions nevertheless remains one of the goals toward which Chicana/o art is directed, and to which this collection hopes to contribute.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

during free public panel April 11

</article-subhead><article-text><p>For the first time, the annual <a href="https://climateconference.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Climate Conference</a> will bring together prominent ocean scientists and leading social-justice advocates to discuss the environmental and equity dimensions of the crisis.</p>
<p>"Climate Justice: Linking Science to Just Action" will take place on Thursday, April 11, at 6:30 p.m. at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz. The event is free and open to the public; <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=3558&amp;cid=7296">advance registration</a> is required.</p>
<p>The conference will focus on local, state, and national efforts to pursue climate justice; the panel discussion will be followed by an interactive opportunity to learn about UC Santa Cruz research and opportunities for local action.</p>
<p>"Climate change is a threat to all of us, yet we also know it will have disproportionate impacts, particularly on those with the fewest economic, political, and social resources," said Katharyne Mitchell, professor of sociology and dean of the UC Santa Cruz Division of Social Sciences, which is co-sponsoring the event. "This year we are bringing together scientists, activists, and the public, because it will take all three working together to address this challenge."</p>
<p>Panelists will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gary Griggs, distinguished professor of Earth Sciences at UC Santa Cruz</li>
<li>Vien Truong, president of <a href="https://www.thedreamcorps.org/">Dream Corps</a>' <a href="http://www.greenforall.org/">Green for All</a></li>
<li>Tiffany Wise-West, sustainability and climate action manager, City of Santa Cruz <a href="http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/government/city-departments/city-manager/climate-action-program">Climate Action Program</a></li>
<li>Alvaro Sanchez, environmental equity director, <a href="http://greenlining.org/">The Greenlining Institute</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Anne Kapuscinski, professor of environmental studies and director of the new <a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/">Coastal Science and Policy Program</a> at UCSC, will moderate the panel discussion.</p>
<p>"These panelists are at the forefront of science- and justice-based responses to climate change," said Kapuscinski. "It's an honor to bring them together to hear about their work and what we can do to help."</p>
<p>Griggs led the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz from 1991-2017 and is widely credited with building an interdisciplinary, conservation-focused program and establishing partnerships with state and federal agencies, policy makers, and nonprofit advocacy groups. He will provide an overview of climate change before the panelists address issues of climate justice.</p>
<p>Following the panel discussion, attendees will be invited to participate in a "Climate Conversations Showcase," during which speakers from the community and UC Santa Cruz will host small, informal group conversations on a variety of climate-change science and climate-justice topics, including opportunities for action.</p>
<p>"Santa Cruz is known for our commitment to the environment, to social justice, and to community action," said Mitchell. "Let's turn our collective attention to climate change and work together to be a model for other communities."</p>
<p>In addition to the Division of Social Sciences, the co-sponsors of this year's Climate Conference include the UC Santa Cruz academic divisions of the Arts, Graduate Studies, and Physical and Biological Sciences; the Coastal Science and Policy Program; and alum Peter Coha (Kresge College '78, mathematics).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="82f0142080727017244b86d947f2b9b4"><name>info-about-strike-activities</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Information and resources about strike activities on March 20, 2019</title><summary>There will be a labor strike beginning 4 a.m. on March 20, and ending at 3:59 a.m. on March 21 by UPTE research support professional (RX) and technical (TX) employees.</summary><start-date>1552460400000</start-date><display-name>Information and resources about strike activities on March 20, 2019</display-name><path>/2019/03/info-about-strike-activities</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/03/info-about-strike-activities</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1552679964866</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1552681025563</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>Our campus received notice last Friday that there will be a labor strike beginning 4 a.m. on March 20, and ending at 3:59 a.m. on March 21 by UPTE research support professional (RX) and technical (TX) employees. Additional bargaining units, including service workers, healthcare professionals, skilled tradespeople, and patient care technical employees will be joining the strike in sympathy. In advance of this scheduled strike activity, we write to share some information and resources that you may find helpful.<br/>&#160;<br/>The strike next week falls during finals week for the campus. The campus expects to hold all exams, review sessions, classes, discussion sections/ labs, and office hours as normal.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The university is committed to ensuring that all people may exercise the constitutionally protected rights of free expression, speech, and assembly. The ongoing opportunity for the expression of a variety of viewpoints is at the core of this commitment. The right of free speech in a university includes the right to acts of peaceful dissent, protests in peaceable assembly, and orderly demonstrations which include picketing.<br/><br/>It is equally important to know that these rights are subject to restrictions based on time, place, and manner rules. For example, UC policy does not allow free expression to disrupt the regular and essential operations of the university, to significantly infringe on the rights of others, or to block or impede ingress to or egress from the campus or buildings. When free expression disrupts our ability to offer classes, administer exams, carry on research, or run the university in general&#8212;or when it violates university policy or the law in any way&#8212;then it may be subject to disciplinary consequences.<br/><br/>Additionally, please remember that no employee is ever obligated to strike. Unions are legally prohibited from threatening or coercing members in other ways to keep them from coming to work. Staff members should remain in contact with their supervisors and managers to discuss their schedules and work locations.<br/>&#160;<br/>If you feel you are being threatened, harassed, intimidated about crossing the picket line, or are prevented from working by picketers or striking employees, please immediately notify your supervisor and your campus employee &amp; labor relations office. In cases of emergency, please dial 9-1-1.<br/>&#160;<br/>Though we do not know how these strike activities will impact the operation of our campus, we are working to do everything we can to ensure continued operations. TAPS Transit Operations will give highest priority to providing Disability Van Service (DVS) clients transport between on-campus locations while suspending the Bike Shuttle and regular Loop and Upper Campus shuttle services. Santa Cruz Metro buses typically do not enter campus during strikes; however, they generally drop-off and pick-up riders at the base of campus.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that three dining halls will be open during the strike; however, dining hall hours will be limited from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and the types of prepared food available will be limited as well. We also anticipate that all cafes and restaurants operated by UC Santa Cruz Dining may be closed.<br/><br/>We also anticipate that the Student Health Services will be open during the strike, but will have limited services. The health center recommends that students proactively take care of any immediate health care needs such as medication refills prior to the strike. Walk-in crisis sessions will be available at CAPS during the day until 4 p.m.&#160; In the event that a student needs access to telephone crisis assessment after 4 p.m., please direct UCSC students to call (831) 459-2628, and select option &#8220;3&#8221; (talk to counselor) on the automated menu. The student will be connected to a crisis counselor who can provide immediate consultation and support by phone.&#160; Students with UC SHIP can also access Anthems Live Health Online Service.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>If you have questions about campus operations on strike days, information will be posted on a special web site: <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/advisory/">http://www.ucsc.edu/advisory/</a>, recorded on the campus communication hotline (459-INFO), provided to KZSC Radio (88.1 FM) for broadcast, and shared via the campus Twitter account (<a href="https://#https://twitter.com/ucsc">https://twitter.com/ucsc)</a>. If access to the campus is not possible, further instructions to the campus community will be posted via these channels.<br/><br/>Finally, if you haven't done so already, please make sure your contact information is current in <a href="https://oes.ucsc.edu/cruzalert/">CruzAlert</a>, the campus's phone-based emergency notification system.<br/><br/>Thank you for your patience during this time.<br/><br/></div></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Steve Stein, Associate Vice Chancellor, Staff Human Resources;  Jen Schiffner, Director, Employee and Labor Relations</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="83552eb880727017244b86d932d4a4fe"><name>solidarity-muslim-community</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In solidarity with our Muslim community</title><summary>Our hearts go out to the Muslim community, and to those whose lives have been shattered — yet again — by a senseless act of violence, this time in New Zealand. </summary><start-date>1552633200000</start-date><display-name>In solidarity with our Muslim community</display-name><path>/2019/03/solidarity-muslim-community</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/03/solidarity-muslim-community</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1552686590826</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1552686847589</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial,                        sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Our hearts go out to the Muslim community, and to those whose lives have been shattered &#8212; yet again &#8212; by a senseless act of violence, this time in New Zealand. This extreme act of hatred is intolerable and unacceptable. It is antithetical to the values we hold dear: respect, inclusion, and social justice.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial,                        sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">As campus leaders we reject this attack and denounce Islamic hate in the strongest terms. Sadly, we recognize we are working in a larger social context where hate exists. So we are speaking up.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial,                        sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Our commitment is to create an inclusive campus culture, and through the impact of our students, faculty, and staff, a world that values and supports every individual, no matter their religious beliefs. The recent <a href="https://cres.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/saugher-nojan-spotlight.html" style="color: #00458c; text-decoration: underline; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Photovoice project</a> about Muslim student experiences on our campus makes clear that our Muslim community does not always experience that support. Therefore, we must strive to improve the experience of our Muslim community. We plan to launch a broader conversation with our Muslim students next quarter, in which we will discuss steps we have already taken and the work that still needs to be done.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial,                        sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">We speak now to reaffirm our commitment to our Muslim community and to call for social justice, respect, and acceptance. We stand in solidarity with our Muslim community here on campus, in the United States, and abroad.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial,                        sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">We urge anyone impacted by this incident, directly or indirectly, to utilize our counseling resources.

But can changes in gene expression be passed on from parents to their children and subsequent generations? Although indirect evidence for this phenomenon, called "transgenerational epigenetic inheritance," is growing, it remains controversial because the mechanisms behind it are so mysterious.</p>
<p>Now researchers at UC Santa Cruz have demonstrated that epigenetic information carried by parental sperm chromosomes can cause changes in gene expression and development in the offspring. Their study, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09141-w">published March 20 in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>, involved a series of clever experiments using the nematode worm <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>.</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes do not alter the DNA sequences of genes, but instead involve chemical modifications to either the DNA itself or to the histone proteins with which DNA is packaged in the chromosomes. These modifications or "marks" change gene expression, turning genes on or off.</p>
<p>In their experiments with <em>C. elegans</em>, researchers in Susan Strome's lab at UC Santa Cruz have focused on histone marks, modifications to specific amino acids in the tails of histone proteins. Strome, a professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology, said the new study addressed a central question in the field of epigenetics.</p>
<p>"It's a very direct question: Does inheriting sperm chromosomes with altered histone packaging of the DNA affect gene expression in the offspring? And the answer is yes," she said.</p>
<p>First author Kiyomi Kaneshiro, a graduate student in Strome's lab who led the study, said <em>C. elegans</em> is a good model for studying this question because histone packaging is fully retained in the worm's sperm chromosomes. In humans and other mammals, histone packaging is only partially retained in sperm.</p>
<p>"There is debate over how much histone packaging is retained in humans, but we know it is retained in some developmentally important regions of the genome," Kaneshiro said.</p>
<p>Researchers have focused on epigenetic inheritance in the paternal line because the sperm contributes little more than its chromosomes to the embryo. The egg contains many other components that may influence the development of the embryo, making it harder to tease out epigenetic effects in the maternal line.</p>
<p>In her experiments, Kaneshiro selectively removed a specific histone mark from sperm chromosomes, then fertilized eggs with the modified sperm and studied the resulting offspring. A crucial innovation was to use sperm and eggs from two different strains of <em>C. elegans</em>, which enabled Kaneshiro to distinguish between the chromosomes inherited from the sperm and those inherited from the egg. She chose worm strains from Britain and Hawaii that had evolved separately long enough to accumulate many small genetic differences (called single nucleotide polymorphisms).</p>
<p>"The dads were British and the moms were Hawaiian, and there are enough differences between them that we could distinguish between the two parental genomes in the cells of their offspring," Kaneshiro said. "Through this hybrid system, we were able to see differences in gene expression that were a direct result of the changes in histone marks on the sperm chromosomes."</p>
<p>Furthermore, those changes in gene expression had developmental consequences. With removal of the histone marks, the sperm chromosomes lost a repressive signal that normally keeps certain genes from being active in the offspring's germline (the cells that give rise to eggs and sperm). Kaneshiro observed that the offspring's germline cells turned on neuronal genes and began developing into neurons.</p>
<p>The particular histone mark removed in these experiments is a widely studied epigenetic mark found in animals ranging from worms to fruit flies to humans. "This mark is found on the histones that are retained on sperm chromosomes in humans," Kaneshiro said.</p>
<p>The new findings show that inherited epigenetic marks affect gene expression and development. But the study involved artificially changing the marks on the sperm chromosomes. What remains to be understood is how environmental effects on an adult organism could alter epigenetic marks in its germline cells, making it possible for those environmental effects to be transmitted to subsequent generations.</p>
<p>"Our findings raise the possibility that histone marks are carriers for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance," Kaneshiro said. "We know that the environment an organism experiences can change gene expression patterns in somatic cells [non-germline body cells]. If it changes gene expression patterns in the germline, we expect that those changes can be inherited, but we haven't shown that yet."</p>
<p>In addition to Kaneshiro and Strome, the coauthors of the study include Andreas Rechtsteiner, a bioinformaticist in Strome's lab.

The local increase would be in addition to the overall rise in temperatures due to global climate change, said coauthor Barry Sinervo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"When you think about the cooling effect of forests in the context of climate change, the effect on local temperatures is really important," Sinervo said. "I was very surprised by the impact of these deforested patches on temperatures in adjacent patches of intact habitat. That should be alarming."</p>
<p>Using recently released data on global changes in forest cover, the researchers developed a new model to quantify how those changes affect local surface temperatures. Their results, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0213368">published March 20 in </a><em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0213368">PLOS ONE</a>,</em> showed that tropical forests are particularly sensitive to the climate effects of changes in forestation.</p>
<p>Forests are known to reflect less sunlight and have higher evapotranspiration (water loss from vegetation to the atmosphere) than open vegetation, which means that changes in forest cover can affect local land surface temperature. Until recently, however, the high-resolution global data needed to quantify this effect was limited.</p>
<p>For the new study, researchers led by first author Jayme Prevedello at Rio de Janeiro State University compiled a global dataset from 2000 to 2010 to quantify the impacts of forest change on local temperatures. They used newly-released data on forest cover, evapotranspiration rates, sunlight-reflection (albedo), and land surface temperature and built a model to quantify the relationship between these variables for tropical, temperate, and boreal regions.</p>
<p>The study found that deforestation and forestation generally appeared to have opposite effects of similar magnitude on local temperature. However, the nature of the effect and the magnitude of the temperature change depended on latitude: in tropical and temperate regions, deforestation led to warming, while forestation had cooling effects. In boreal regions, deforestation led to slight cooling, though the magnitude of the effect was smaller. The magnitude of the forest change effects was greatest in tropical regions, with, for example, deforestation of approximately 50 percent leading to local warming of over 1 degree Celsius.</p>
<p>The authors used their model to predict local temperature change in Brazil between 2010 and 2050. Assuming the current rate of illegal deforestation is maintained, this predicted an annual land surface temperature rise of up to 1.45 degrees Celsius in some areas by 2050. However, if no further illegal deforestation occurred, the temperature rise could be far more limited.</p>
<p>"Forests have the potential to attenuate the levels of local warming even in the face of ongoing climate change, but this is most pronounced in tropical regions compared to temperate regions of the world," Sinervo said. "We have many biodiversity hotspots in tropical regions of the world, so forest protection and reforestation are key strategies we can put in place to protect biodiversity right now."</p>
<p>Sinervo led a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/05/3787.html">2010 survey of lizard populations</a> around the world that found an alarming pattern of population extinctions already occurring due to rising temperatures. He subsequently led an international collaboration to investigate how climate change is affecting plant communities and animal populations around the world. Through this work, he made connections with Brazilian researchers, including coauthor Gisele Winck at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>"I have been all over Brazil, including a long trip along the 'arc of deforestation,' and it inspired us to get these big data visualizations going," Sinervo said.</p>
<p>The new model quantifies the effect of forest change on local surface temperatures through changes in sunlight-reflection and evapotranspiration. The results for Brazil provide a case study showing that current land use policies can significantly affect local climate in the future.</p>

This was different, however, because he had an assignment from a magazine editor to write movie reviews.</p>
<p>Koch and four friends and fellow scientists reviewed 10 movies with science or technology themes for <em>Science</em> magazine, published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Their reviews will be published in the March 22 issue of the magazine and are <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/books/2019/03/18/science-at-sundance/">now available online</a>.</p>
<p>Gabrielle Kardon, a geneticist at the University of Utah (and Koch's former graduate school housemate), had pitched the idea to Valerie Thompson, <em>Science's</em> editor of book and media reviews. In 2018, Kardon had reviewed the documentary <em>Three Identical Strangers</em> for <em>Science</em>, but she thought that Sundance merited more attention from scientists.</p>
<p>"I was in Salt Lake City on sabbatical, and Gabrielle and I started talking about it after the 2018 festival, because there were some really good movies that dealt with science or issues related to science, and we thought it would be good to let people know about them. Gabrielle had the idea of sending a team of scientists to the festival and invited me along for the ride," Koch said.</p>
<p>One of the movies he reviewed was <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/books/2019/03/18/sea-of-shadows/"><em>Sea of Shadows</em></a>, a documentary about efforts to save the vaquita, "a tiny porpoise of Disneyesque cuteness" that is "hurtling toward extinction." Koch also reviewed <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/books/2019/03/18/bedlam/"><em>Bedlam</em></a>, a disturbing film about mental illness, mass incarceration, and homelessness in the United States.</p>

This space in Quarry Plaza will fill an important need, offering our student community a quiet space to pursue spiritual well-being through prayer or meditation.</p>
<p>The drop-in center will occupy the space currently used by ID Card and Book Buyback Services, next to Bay Tree Bookstore. These services will move to new locations within the store. We aim to open the reflection space in May.</p>
<p>Students and our faith community have called for the creation of a prayer space for two decades. While the reflection space is not perfect, it is long overdue and helps us in a small way address longstanding concerns of our Muslim community. I want to recognize the leadership of our Muslim students in making this happen. The students and the Muslim Student Association, as well as members of the University Interfaith Council, have long advocated for such a space. More recently, the Division of Student Success; Colleges, Housing and Educational Services; Bay Tree Bookstore and ID Card Services; and staff and faculty across campus have worked creatively and collaboratively to help bring this to fruition.</p>
<p>I am also grateful to Greg Gilbert, chair of the environmental studies department, for providing temporary space in the Interdisciplinary Sciences Building the past few years to tide us over until this point.</p>
<p>While we have identified space on a campus with real space shortages, there are still many questions to answer and much work to be done. I have asked the Dean of Students Office to lead a campuswide conversation about use and oversight of this new student resource. Please contact the Dean of Students Office (<a href="mailto:deanofstudents@ucsc.edu">deanofstudents@ucsc.edu</a>) with any questions or if you would like to be involved.</p>
<p>I look forward to the grand opening and will share more information about this reflection space soon.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="93113e0f80727017244b86d9bd6bd24d"><name>payroll-information</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Paper check payroll information for March 20, 2019 - biweekly pay</title><summary>In order to ensure that employees receiving paper checks can receive their pay on payday, paper checks will be delivered to campus mailstops no later than 11:45 a.m. on Tuesday, March 19.</summary><start-date>1552892400000</start-date><display-name>Paper check payroll information for March 20, 2019 - biweekly pay</display-name><path>/2019/03/payroll-information</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/03/payroll-information</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1552950573726</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1552950573726</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div></div>

<div></div>
<div>Pursuant to our campuswide communication <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/03/info-about-strike-activities.html">last week</a>, there will be a labor strike on campus on Wednesday, March 20. Next Wednesday is a biweekly pay date, meaning that biweekly employees receive their pay for the previous pay period. In order to ensure that employees receiving paper checks can receive their pay on payday, paper checks will be delivered to campus mailstops <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">no later than 11:45 a.m.</span> on Tuesday, March 19. Those receiving a paper check one day early are advised to not deposit or cash the check before the check date, March 20, as they may be rejected by banking institutions.&#160;</div>

<p>"You don't have a lot of skills yet. Be flexible," Wojcicki told a crowd of several hundred, including many students, that gathered in the Colleges 9/10 Multipurpose Room on Saturday morning. "Join a great company where you're going to learn. Be open and willing to do anything that's asked."</p>
<p>That advice was among the gems alumni Wojcicki (M.S., '93) and her husband Dennis Troper (M.S., '93) offered during a free-ranging, hour-long conversation with Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp about their path from the redwoods to the highest echelons of YouTube and Google. Wojcicki and Troper, who directs product management for the wearables division of Google, met on campus as graduate students in the master's in applied economics program. They married in 1998&#8212;one year before Wojcicki joined Google as employee No. 16.</p>
<p>Today, as hugely successful tech leaders and the parents of five children, Wojcicki and Troper have plenty of opportunities to give career advice to college students, and their own kids.</p>
<p>"When our son wanted to work at Pixar, I told him to say, 'I'll do anything. I'll take any job at Pixar,' " she said. "Once you're inside, it's easier to move around. Learn skills, do a great job, and you'll be positioned for your next job."</p>
<p><strong>What's the world going to look like in 10 years?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2018/10/tuned-in/">One of the most powerful and accomplished women in Silicon Valley</a>, Wojcicki was five months pregnant when she signed on at Google. "It didn't seem like a risky decision," she recalled. "I saw that this is the future."</p>
<p>That willingness to embrace the unknown has propelled Wojcicki's career.</p>
<p>"I tell people to think about what's meaningful to them and to choose areas where you see growth," she said, adding that she sees a lot of opportunity in technology. "We're at the beginning of this revolution."</p>
<p>"Following your passion is really important," added Troper. "Don't follow the easy route. Challenge yourself to get the hard work done."</p>
<p>Wojcicki sees the medical field being transformed by technology, through drug discovery, apps, and genetics, while Troper noted that climate change poses another huge opportunity for tech entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>"I say, ask yourself what you think the world will look like in 10 years&#8212;I ask myself that, too&#8212;and then work backwards," said Wojcicki. "What's going to be big in 10 years that's not big today?"</p>
<p><strong>Unconscious bias, censorship, and free speech</strong></p>
<p>As a woman in tech, Wojcicki has faced challenges, some of which she attributes to "unconscious bias."</p>
<p>"I try to give people the benefit of the doubt&#8212;and I also make sure it doesn't get in my way," she said, describing techniques she has developed over the years. "I'll tell people, 'I already know that.' Or 'I'm the world's expert in that.' Or 'I developed that system.' "</p>
<p>"Try to think positively and try to make it work," she said. "When it's an issue, bring it up. And try to be in a place that's fundamentally supportive."</p>
<p>At YouTube, the biggest challenges facing the company today are ensuring high-quality content, matching it to users, and striking the balance between censorship and free speech, said Wojcicki.</p>
<p>Days after 49 people were killed in attacks on two mosques in New Zealand, Wojcicki emphasized that YouTube has always removed content that promotes hate or violence or contains adult content. With 500 hours of content being uploaded every minute, YouTube relies heavily on machine learning to flag content for removal. The company recently changed its algorithms and is in the process of rolling out "big changes" globally, she said.</p>
<p>But it's a "gray area," said Wojcicki. "If we're not careful, we'll be removing voices. We want to enable all different voices as long as they meet our policies."</p>
<p><strong>Education, cautionary tales, and "knowing how to hustle"</strong></p>
<p>Wojcicki, who earned an undergraduate degree in history and literature from Harvard, credits her two years at UC Santa Cruz with giving her the quantitative skills in math, statistics, economics, and econometrics that propelled her career in high tech.</p>
<p>"I value my humanities degree," she said, noting that her background helps her grapple with big questions and the implications of decisions. But data analysis is at the core of all of Google's operations, and she relied on quantitative skills when she managed the ad systems that generate revenue for Google. "That foundation really enabled me to do that job," she said.</p>
<p>Troper said UC Santa Cruz "gave us the tools&#8230; to try to make sense of the world. At Google, it's all about having the tools to build products we think people will love."</p>
<p>Asked if they had any "cautionary tales" for students, Wojcicki recalled a commencement address that focused on the tale of the Titanic.</p>
<p>"Remember, the Titanic was about a person with hubris who made a big mistake, and people died as a result," she said. "It is possible to really screw up. That stayed with me."</p>
<p>When the tech bubble burst in 2000, many successful people lost everything, and empty buildings dotted the landscape of Silicon Valley. "It's really important to stay humble and aware and cautious that you can make mistakes," she said. "Always being self-reflective is super valuable."</p>
<p>Troper, who grew up in Costa Rica, said he followed the traditional path from school to college to work&#8212;"because nobody taught me better." In retrospect, he wishes he had taken more advantage of all the resources and extracurricular activities that were available to him in college. "Get involved in things other than the three or four courses you're taking," he advised students in the audience. "It really matters in the formation of you as a person."</p>
<p>Asked what universities can do to encourage and develop entrepreneurs, Wojcicki said entrepreneurs "need to know how to hustle."</p>
<p>"How do you present an idea? How do you get people to believe in you? How do you lead other people? How do you think about an idea&#8212;something that doesn't exist&#8212;and convince people they need it?," she said. "When we were starting Google, we had to do that."</p>
<p>Troper said the best entrepreneurs he knows are "very personable and they understand and cherish having diverse people around them. Understand cultures beyond your own." Diversity is important for its own sake, but it also makes products more successful. For example, he said, heart rate sensors on smart watches perform differently on different types of skin.</p>
<p>"Diversity is really important in all the companies we run," said Wojcicki, noting that . "Our audience is diverse. Two billion people come to YouTube every month. The people we hire represent the users we serve, and the creators we serve."</p>
<p>After the event, Tromp expressed appreciation for the duo&#8217;s willingness to return to campus and share their wisdom with students. "Susan and Dennis are extraordinarily warm and generous people, and they have so much to offer our students and this university," she said. "Their paths demonstrate that students in all of our majors have something to offer big tech and have the training to shape our nation&#8217;s future. It was an honor and a delight to spend time with them."</p>

Hamilton for live music, evening astronomy lectures from world-renowned scientists, and the opportunity to view celestial objects through historic telescopes.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/summer/">Summer Series</a>, expanded due to public demand, now includes six <em>Music of the Spheres</em> dates and six <em>Evenings with the Stars</em> dates, and the observatory also offers 20 Public Evening Tours<em>.</em> Tickets to these events tend to sell very quickly and will be available to the general public online at <a href="http://www.ucsctickets.com">www.ucsctickets.com</a>, starting promptly at noon on Wednesday, April 17.</p>
<p>Each <em>Music of the Spheres</em> concert features a musical performance, an astronomy lecture by a scientist, and a history presentation about Lick Observatory&#8217;s rich past. Afterward, guests take turns viewing celestial objects through the 36-inch Great Lick Refractor and the 40-inch Nickel Reflector. Guests have additional opportunities to stargaze with small ground telescopes provided by amateur astronomers.</p>
<p>The <em>Music of the Spheres</em> concerts take place June 8 (Oscar Reynolds and Karumanta), June 22 (Golden Bough), July 13 (The Quitters), July 27 (White Album Ensemble), August 10 (Folias Duo), and August 24 (Dave Rocha Qaurtet). For additional details and ticket information, visit <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/summer/music/program.html">www.ucolick.org/summer</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Evenings with the Stars</em> program gives the public a chance to view through the 36-inch Great Lick Refractor and the 40-inch Nickel Reflector as well. Similar to the <em>Music of the Spheres</em> events, each program features an astronomy lecture by a &#8220;star&#8221; scientist and a history presentation. Amateur astronomers also set up ground telescopes so that guests can get additional telescope time.</p>
<p>Dates for the <em>Evenings with the Stars</em> are June 7, June 21, July 12, July 26, August 9, and August 23. For additional details and ticket information, visit <a href="http://ucolick.org/summer/stars/program.html">www.ucolick.org/summer</a>.</p>
<p>The Public Evening Tours offer an expert-guided, four- to six-hour "behind-the-scenes" walking tour of Lick Observatory. Participants can learn about the unique history of the world&#8217;s first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory, the eccentric California pioneer James Lick, technology used for observing on different telescopes along the tour route, and current science being conducted at Lick Observatory. After dark and weather permitting, guests can view celestial objects through the historic 36-inch Great Refractor telescope. For dates, additional details, and ticket information, visit <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/main/visit/evening_tours.shtml">www.ucolick.org</a>.</p>
<p>Lick Observatory is located on the summit of Mt. Hamilton in the Diablo Range east of San Jose. Driving time from San Jose is about one hour via Mount Hamilton Road. Founded in 1888, Lick Observatory is at the forefront of astronomical research as an active research facility. It is operated by the University of California Observatories (UCO), a multi-campus research unit that serves eight UC campuses and is headquartered at UC Santa Cruz. More information is available online at <a href="http://www.ucolick.org">www.ucolick.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Weather may restrict telescope viewings, but other activities will still take place. Due to historic construction of the telescope domes, the 36-inch Great Refractor and the 40-inch Nickel Telescope are not wheelchair accessible at this time. Children must be at least 8 years of age for admission. Due to late hours the program may be difficult for children under 12. <em>Music of the Spheres</em> is for ages 12 and over only.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>05-31-2019</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="97d0f8a780727017244b86d932305a22"><name>grad-slam-feature-story2019</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The elephant seal in the room</title><summary>Sixth-year ecology and evolutionary biology Ph.D. student Sarah Kienle wowed the judges at UC Santa Cruz’s annual Grad Slam, a competition that requires grad students to distill years of research into three-minute pitches. </summary><start-date>1553029200000</start-date><display-name>gradslamfeature</display-name><path>/2019/03/grad-slam-feature-story2019</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/03/grad-slam-feature-story2019</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1553030247735</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1553541199346</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZBppu9YyJeE" width="560"></iframe></embed><width>500</width><caption>The Grad Slam is available to watch online.</caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/03/gradslamfullgroup</path><link>site://news/2019/03/gradslamfullgroup</link><site>news</site><name>gradslamfullgroup</name><display-name>gradslamfullgroup</display-name><file-size>54506</file-size></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/03/images/gradslamthumb80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/03/images/gradslamthumb80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gradslamthumb80.jpg</name><display-name>gradslamthumb80.jpg</display-name><file-size>16893</file-size><width>80</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>This year's Grad Slam finalists posed for a picture with&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">L</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ori Kletzer, vice provost and dean of the Division of Graduate Studies (left.)

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sixth-year ecology and evolutionary biology Ph.D. student </span><a href="http://mehta.eeb.ucsc.edu/sarahkienle/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah Kienle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wowed the judges and cracked up an audience of 200 people at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s annual Grad Slam, a competition that requires grad students to distill years of research into fast-paced three-minute elevator pitches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grad Slam, also known as the Three-Minute Thesis Challenge, is a University of California systemwide competition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s version is sponsored by the campus&#8217;s Division of Graduate Studies, with sponsorship of the prizes by the five academic divisions: Arts, Baskin School of Engineering, Humanities, Physical and Biological Sciences, and Social Sciences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dramatic sexual dimorphism (a scientific term for differences in size and appearance between males and females of the same species) and foraging behaviors of male and female elephant seals may sound like unlikely material for comedy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Kienle, the evening&#8217;s $3,000 grand prize winner, made clever use of her comic timing at the sold-out Kuumbwa Jazz Center in downtown Santa Cruz. She began the speech with a deadpan question: &#8220;What if I told you that males and females are &#8230; different?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In nature, she explained, sexual dimorphism can take many forms, from the quintessential mane of the lion to the showy plumage of the male peacock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This begs the question,&#8221; Kienle continued. &#8220;Why are males and females of &#160;the same species different?&#8221; This question led her to pursue a Ph.D. on what she described as &#8220;one of the most sexually dimorphic species on the planet&#8212;the northern elephant seal.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Kienle explained, male and female elephant seals are extremely different in size and shape. &#8220;Males weigh up to 5,000 pounds, making females look dainty in comparison, at only 1,000 to 2,000 pounds.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also have different appearances, including, most famously, the males&#8217; large floppy noses that give the seal species its name. The females lack that distinctive feature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kienle wanted to know how those differences in size and shape translated to differences in other aspects of their &#160;biology including feeding, &#8220;a rather important process if you like living,&#8221; she said, drawing appreciative snickers from the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turns out, those varying shapes correspond to the males&#8217; and females&#8217; different feeding strategies. The males are &#8220;continental shelf predators,&#8221; meaning they feast on life forms at the bottom of the sea floor, while females travel across wide swaths of the northern Pacific Ocean in search of prey at mid-sea layers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why are the males such burly bruisers, and the females so svelte and slight in comparison? As Kienle pointed out, the males eat a lot more food on their foraging trips, which is important because they must bulk up quickly to fight other males for dominance and fend off challengers who are vying for the same females. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time is of the essence because so many of the males get killed during their foraging journeys. They must get huge, and mate as soon as possible to sustain the life cycle. It is a short and brutish existence; &#8220;if you are lucky you get to do that for one to two years,&#8221; Kienle said, inserting a dramatic pause. &#8220;And then you die!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Females are much &#160;smaller, with greater longevity, because they forage for less food, giving them a &#8220;lower risk, lower reward strategy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Grad Slam&#8217;s $1,500 runner-up prize winner is fifth-year ocean sciences Ph.D. student Rachel Harbeitner, who is studying deep-sea microbes that consume stored-up carbon in the world&#8217;s oceans, making them an essential part of ocean ecology, as well as global atmospheric conditions. She is part of a team that undertook experiments on the ocean floor, studying how long it takes for these bacteria to gobble up carbon in the bodies of dead plankton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the bottom of the ocean, &#8220;it&#8217;s really cold and completely dark, and they&#8217;re living under high pressure,&#8221; Harbeitner said. &#8220;I thought, &#8216;Maybe in the course of a year, they will eat these carbon bodies?&#8221; Instead, the bacteria ate the carbon in only a week, which is 50 times faster than the researchers predicted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the bacteria are microscopic, the implications of their dining habits are enormous. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We know that oceans regulate global climate,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But tiny organisms, down in the deep sea, are impacting how carbon circulates through the ocean and atmosphere. We can use this new information to better predict how oceans are going to respond to the human impacts of climate change.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customarily, the Grad Slam grand prize winner goes on to represent UC Santa Cruz at the UC Office of the President&#8217;s systemwide Grad Slam competition. However, Sarah Kienle will be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Antarctica studying leopard seals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the direct result of the recent federal government shutdown, which forced the research mission to reschedule. That means Harbeitner instead of Kienle will represent UC Santa Cruz at the systemwide competition on May 10 in San Francisco. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#160;People&#8217;s Choice award&#8212;which comes with a $750 prize&#8212;went to seventh-year psychology Ph.D. student Priscilla Sung, whose </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">research explores &#8220;task-switching,&#8221; a term for the human brain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8217;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s general ability to change or toggle between tasks, such as when you are interrupted by text messages while writing a work email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sung described the ability to task-switch as a mental muscle that is developed over time, through experience and practice. The more task-switching that people do, the stronger and more flexible that muscle will be. And being bilingual could help people strengthen this task-switching muscle, she adds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Switching back and forth between languages&#8212;or code-switching&#8212;might use the same muscle you use when you switch between emailing and texting,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s this hidden workout behind bilingualism that fascinates me.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sung&#8217;s current project investigates this connection between task-switching and code-switching in an unusually young group of subjects: 3- and 4-year-olds at a bilingual preschool in the Bay Area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The preschoolers complete a series of tasks that require them to switch between different sets of rules, such as sorting objects first by shape and then by color. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To you, it might sound simple, but for little kids, it&#8217;s actually pretty tough&#8212;like, hilariously tough,&#8221; she said with a laugh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, to get a sense of how much code-switching the kids are doing at home and at school, she consults their parents and preschool teachers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing how differently every kid uses language,&#8221; she remarks. &#8220;There&#8217;s really no such thing as the &#8216;typical&#8217; bilingual experience.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the project is still underway, but she hopes to have results in the next few months, by the time these kids graduate from preschool and head to kindergarten. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sung, a developmental psychologist, says that kids&#8217; ability to task-switch holds implications for how they will learn to handle the growing demands in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we do as kids lays a path for how we learn to navigate our complex roles as adults,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the evening was entertaining for the audience, it has a serious purpose. L</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ori Kletzer, vice provost and dean of the Division of Graduate Studies, pointed out that the UC Office of the President asks all 10 UCs to hold Grad Slams for the professional development it gives the graduate students who participate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Grad Slam has become perhaps the most fun way that our graduate students communicate (about) the research they&#8217;re working on,&#8221; Kletzer told the audience. &#8220;This is really a platform for graduate students to share their passion for their research.&#8221; </span></p>

<p>Costa is an internationally recognized expert on the physiology, ecology, and behavior of marine mammals, with work founded on a deep understanding of oceanography and Earth history. He has been a pioneer in the development and use of electronic tags to track the movements and behavior of marine mammals and to gather oceanographic data. He has also served in leadership positions at the campus, national, and international level.</p>
<p>After earning a B.A. in zoology at UCLA and his Ph.D. in biology at UC Santa Cruz, Costa was a postdoctoral scholar at Scripps Institution of Oceanography before returning to UC Santa Cruz as an IMS research biologist in 1983. He was appointed to the faculty as an associate professor in 1991.</p>
<p>"Given his history, Dan has a profound knowledge of the key role that IMS plays in fostering and amplifying interdisciplinary marine and coastal research at UC Santa Cruz," said Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, in a message announcing the appointment.</p>
<p>Costa said he wants to continue developing the collaborative atmosphere that has long been a strength of the IMS.</p>
<p>"The IMS brings together the marine science expertise we have across departments and creates tremendous opportunities to share and collaborate," he said. "My career really developed within the IMS, so it's a great honor for me to continue the legacy built by people like Bill Doyle and Gary Griggs and Pete Raimondi."</p>
<p>Costa will take the helm from Raimondi, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, who served as interim director of the IMS from 2017 to 2019. Koch noted that Raimondi, having served as department chair for over a decade, had made it clear he was not interested in a long-term appointment as IMS director.</p>
<p>Established in 1976 as the Center for Coastal Marine Studies, the IMS is an interdisciplinary research unit supporting a diverse group of faculty and researchers working on marine biology, coastal ecology, fisheries and fishery management, ocean processes, marine toxicology, and marine geology. IMS researchers have earned international recognition as experts on marine mammals and seabirds, coastal ecosystems, marine protected areas, harmful algal blooms, climate change, sea level rise, and other topics.</p>
<p>The institute provides state-of-the-art facilities both on the main UCSC campus and at the Coastal Science Campus, which has grown dramatically since Long Marine Laboratory opened in 1978.</p>
<p>"It's a really vibrant place now, and the whole marine mammal facility is brand new and gorgeous," said Costa, who came to UCSC as a graduate student before Long Marine Lab and the IMS even existed. "I've watched it grow and develop from the start, and I look forward to helping the IMS move to the next stage."</p>
<p>A fellow of the California Academy of Sciences, Costa held the Ida Benson Lynn Chair in Ocean Health at UC Santa Cruz from 2008 to 2013. He has served on the U.S. Ocean Resources and Research Advisory Panel and as a program manager for the Office of Naval Research. Costa has also held leadership positions on large multi-institutional projects and research consortia, such as the Tagging of Pacific Predators (TOPP) program, which he co-founded, the Southern Ocean Observing System, and the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System. He received the Antarctica Service Medal, and Costa Spur in Antarctica was named in his honor in 2006.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9d7f952280727017244b86d99e51833f"><name>sierra-streams</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Climate change and drought threaten small mountain streams in the Sierra Nevada</title><summary>Aquatic life in small headwater streams is especially vulnerable to the effects of prolonged drought, according to a study of mid-elevation streams in the Sierra Nevada.</summary><keywords>David Herbst</keywords><start-date>1553151600000</start-date><display-name>Climate change and drought threaten small mountain streams in the Sierra Nevada</display-name><path>/2019/03/sierra-streams</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/03/sierra-streams</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1553125577129</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1553178055175</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/03/images/mountain-stream-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/03/images/mountain-stream-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mountain-stream-400.jpg</name><display-name>mountain-stream-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>277554</file-size><width>400</width><height>533</height></image><image-alt>mountain stream</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/03/images/mountain-stream-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/03/images/mountain-stream-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mountain-stream-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>mountain-stream-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>28741</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>mountain stream</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Headwater streams in the Sierra Nevada depend on snowmelt to maintain year-round flows.

Researchers monitoring aquatic life in Sierra Nevada streams observed significant declines in the numbers of aquatic insects and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates during the drought. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The most vulnerable species included many of the larger insects preferred as food by fish, birds, and other wildlife, said David Herbst, a research biologist at UC Santa Cruz and first author of a paper on the new findings, </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fwb.13270"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">published </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>March 7</span></span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> in </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Freshwater Biology</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Native species of stream insects that have sensitive requirements for flow and water quality, and usually live in the rapids of shallow rocky riffles, were especially vulnerable to prolonged drought,&#8221; Herbst said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Smaller insects that have shorter life cycles and are better adapted to low flows were able to persist during the drought, but many of the large, long-lived species that have higher food value to fish and birds suffered losses across the entire network of headwater streams, he said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Herbst and other UC and Forest Service researchers conducted studies from 2002 through 2015 in mid-elevation streams of the Kings River Experimental Watersheds. Hundreds of species of aquatic insects and other invertebrates occupy different habitat types within these streams, consuming algae and decomposing organic matter. Late in the drought, the researchers observed significant declines in the densities of about 40 percent of the most common species of mayflies, stoneflies, and caddis flies.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">What we saw was pretty disturbing, with a diverse and rich fauna of stream invertebrates becoming decimated, especially as the smaller streams became intermittent and sections of the channel dried,&#8221; Herbst said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Climate change may be altering the conditions that have in the past sustained perennial flows in the headwater streams of the Sierra Nevada, which are fed by snowmelt. Extremes of drought and flooding are expected to become more frequent, and more precipitation is expected to fall as rain, reducing the size of the snowpack. Warming temperatures will also cause the snowpack to melt faster. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">For small headwater streams, these changes will mean low flows starting earlier in the summer and a greater likelihood of running dry in late summer and fall. With less water in the streams, swift riffle zones give way to more pools and slower currents, changing the types of habitats available for aquatic insects.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">According to Herbst, the streams they studied showed resilience during the first years of the drought, with no significant loss of species richness. &#8220;Short-term drought of a year or two may be accommodated, but damages set in with prolonged drought exposure,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Further research is needed to address the capacity of these streams for recovery after normal flows resume. But Herbst said headwater streams may have a limited capacity for recovery if there are no upstream refuges from which aquatic organisms could recolonize them. Flooding, erosion, and wildfires pose additional threats to mountain stream ecosystems, he said.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Climate is changing at a fast pace, and it will be important to understand how aquatic ecosystems are affected by the climatic whiplash of conditions that swing between extremes of drought and flooding,&#8221; Herbst said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In addition to Herbst, the coauthors of the paper include Scott Cooper and Sheila Wiseman at UC Santa Barbara, Robert Medhurst at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory, and Carolyn Hunsaker at the Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station in Fresno. This work was supported by the U.S. Forest Service. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9e4af28880727017244b86d92fa837b1"><name>red-blood-cells</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Study gives new perspective on production of blood cells and immune cells</title><summary>Researchers tracked and quantified the production of different kinds of blood cells and immune cells to understand how the body maintains a balanced supply.</summary><keywords>Camilla Forsberg</keywords><start-date>1553180400000</start-date><display-name>Study gives new perspective on production of blood cells and immune cells</display-name><path>/2019/03/red-blood-cells</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/03/red-blood-cells</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1553138904886</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1553181319261</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/03/images/stemcell-differentiation-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/03/images/stemcell-differentiation-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stemcell-differentiation-410.jpg</name><display-name>stemcell-differentiation-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>81467</file-size><width>410</width><height>505</height></image><image-alt>diagram of stem cell differentiation pathways</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/03/images/stemcell-differentiation-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/03/images/stemcell-differentiation-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stemcell-differentiation-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>stemcell-differentiation-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27069</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>diagram of stem cell differentiation pathways</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>New findings support a model of blood cell differentiation in which the production of red blood cells is the default fate of hematopoietic stem cells, which can also produce platelets and white blood cells.

The other one percent are platelets and the various white blood cells of the immune system. How all the different kinds of mature blood cells are derived from the same "hematopoietic" stem cells in the bone marrow has been the subject of intense research, but most studies have focused on the one percent, the immune cells.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"It's a bit odd, but because red blood cells are enucleated and therefore hard to track by genetic markers, their production has been more or less ignored by the vast number of studies in the past couple of decades," said Camilla Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In a new study, <a href="https://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711(19)30055-4">published March 21 in </a></span><a href="https://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711(19)30055-4"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Stem Cell Reports</i></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, Forsberg's lab overcame technical obstacles to provide a thorough accounting of blood cell production from hematopoietic stem cells. Their findings are important for understanding disorders such as anemia, diseases of the immune system, and blood cancers such as leukemias and lymphomas.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"We're trying to understand the balance of production of blood cells and immune cells, which goes wrong in many kinds of disorders," Forsberg said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The process by which hematopoietic stem cells give rise to mature blood cells involves multiple populations of progenitor cells that become progressively more committed to a specific "fate" as they develop into fully mature cells. A major fork in the road is between "lymphoid progenitors," which give rise to white blood cells called lymphocytes, and "myeloid progenitors," which give rise to other kinds of white blood cells, as well as red blood cells and platelets. The majority of cells in the bone marrow are in the myeloid lineage.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">A key finding of the new study is that all progenitor cells with myeloid potential produce far more red blood cells than any other cell type. This was surprising because many previous studies in which progenitor cells were grown in cell cultures ("in vitro") found they had limited capacity to produce red blood cells and platelets. Forsberg said those results now appear to be an artifact of the culture conditions.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"It's been hard to make sense of a lot of those experiments, because we know our bodies need to make a lot of red blood cells and platelets," she said. "Our results show that these progenitor cells retain a lot of red blood cell potential. In fact, we propose that red blood cell production is the default pathway."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In experiments led by first author Scott Boyer, a graduate student in Forsberg's lab, researchers transplanted different progenitor cell populations into mice and tracked the production of red blood cells as well as platelets (the second largest component of blood) and immune cells. Boyer was also able to transplant single progenitor cells and then identify the blood and immune cells it produced. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">By quantifying the numbers of mature blood cells produced from transplanted progenitors, the researchers were able to show that red blood cells were by far the most abundant cell type produced by every type of progenitor cell, with the exception of lymphoid progenitors. Their findings led to the development of a model of hematopoietic differentiation that focuses on red blood cells as the default pathway for all myeloid progenitors. </span></p>

<p>The festival will include performances by two internationally known ensembles, the <strong><em>Del Sol String Quartet</em> </strong>and <strong><em>wasteLAnd</em></strong><em>--</em>each playing the work of UCSC student composers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world-renowned <em>Del Sol String Quartet</em> with percussionist Chris Froh will be in residence for a week in early April, refining the works designed especially for them by our culturally and intellectually diverse graduate composers,&#8221; noted UC Santa Cruz music professor David Evan Jones. &#8220;Their performance will be on April 13.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>WasteLAnd,</em> a virtuosic 11-piece ensemble from Los Angeles, also arrives in late April to work in residence for several days on pieces conceived specifically for its unique extended instrumental capabilities by another set of graduate composers--each with their own highly individual concept,&#8221;&#160;he added. &#8220;This engaging collaboration will reach its culmination in concert on April 27.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Jones is the director</strong> of this year&#8217;s <em>April in Santa Cruz</em> festival, the Music Department's annual celebration of new music.&#160;Each year there is a different director, and each one takes a different tack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the community-based emphasis of the festival, the director is both a facilitator of ideas already &#8216;in the air&#8217; and an innovator and mover who creates and develops opportunities for expanding and communicating our creative potential,&#8221; said Jones.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were extremely fortunate this year to receive support from a variety of sources, including a generous gift from the&#160;Vincent J. Coates Foundation,&#160;which made possible the residencies of both the Del Sol String Quartet and the wasteLAnd ensemble,&#8221; Jones added. &#8220;The announcement of those residencies, in turn, sparked a whirlwind of musical speculation, innovation, and experimentation by our graduate students.&#8221;</p>
<p>The concert series kicks off on April 6th with Karlton Hester's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhOcdO5Z3JU"><strong><em>Quantum Elders Hip-Bop Ballet</em></strong></a><em>,</em> which Jones describes as a 10-part multimedia program featuring both preconceived and spontaneous ("improvised") musical compositions with live African and hip hop dancers and original video synthesis.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinister Resonance" is the title of the April 12th concert which offers arrangements by music professor Larry Polansky and lecturer William Coulter of mid-20th-century works by ultramodernist composers Ruth Crawford Seeger (<em>Sacco, Vanzetti</em>) and Henry Cowell (<em>Sinister Resonance</em>).&#160;</p>
<p>That concert will also feature music by UCSC faculty composers, including Hi Kyung Kim&#8217;s new version of her <em>Untamed Brush I for viola</em> and Jones&#8217;s new work for violin and Disklavier (computer-controlled piano).&#160;Festival founder David Cope will additionally bring back <em>Parallax</em> (1974), an evocative work for voice and piano, and Chris Pratorius Gomez will conclude the evening with his setting of Edgar Allen Poe's <em>A Dream Within a Dream</em>. &#160;</p>
<p>The UCSC Percussion Ensemble and Sundanese Gamelan are featured in the first half of the April 26 concert, followed by two premieres by music faculty--Ben Leeds Carson's <em>Lament and Conductus</em> for Haegeum (Korean vertical 'violin' played by Soo-yeon Lyuh) and electric guitar played by the composer, and Hi Kyung Kim's <em>the</em> <em>westwind holds my melting heart! </em>for clarinet and percussion.</p>
<p>All concerts take place at the Music Center Recital Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus and are free and open to the public. Doors open at 7 p.m. Concerts begin at 7:30 p.m. For more information, visit the Arts Division <strong><em><a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/april-santa-cruz-festival-0">web site</a></em></strong>.</p>

<p>Established in 2017, the Heising-Simons Foundation 51 Pegasi b Fellowship is named for the first exoplanet discovered orbiting a sun-like star. The fellowship provides up to $375,000 of support for independent research over three years, as well as other benefits including an annual summit to develop professional networks, exchange information and ideas, and foster collaboration.</p>
<p>In her research at UC Santa Cruz, Yu plans to explore how clouds, hazes, fog, dust, and other matter interact with different wavelengths of light, and how these relationships impact the signals we receive from exoplanets.</p>
<p>Yu said she is intrigued by the abundant &#8220;super-Earths&#8221; and &#8220;mini-Neptunes&#8221; detected by the Kepler space mission. Since these exoplanets are completely unlike anything found in our own solar system, uncovering new information can contribute to a greater understanding of a large and diverse class of objects in the galaxy. As an experimentalist, she aims to generate a more realistic portrait of these exoplanets by expanding upon her research on Titan, Saturn&#8217;s largest moon, and reproducing organic particles in exoplanet atmospheres through lab simulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goal is to create more self-consistent models of clouds and hazes so we can get realistic simulations of what&#8217;s happening on exoplanets,&#8221; said Yu, who is currently completing her Ph.D. in planetary science at Johns Hopkins University.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a66c61af80727017244b86d92d92ce0f"><name>cowell-closure-updates</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Updates on Cowell and Stevenson Commons</title><summary>The Cowell and Stevenson Student Commons facility has been closed due to a construction-related asbestos contamination incident. </summary><start-date>1553238000000</start-date><display-name>Cowell closure updates</display-name><path>/2019/03/cowell-closure-updates</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/03/cowell-closure-updates</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1553275313718</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1554421861084</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As a final community update on this incident, please be advised that asbestos abatement from the construction-related contamination at Cowell and Stevenson colleges has been completed. PPDO and EH&amp;S inspected 295 rooms or areas in which the contractor had worked. Of these, 35 were found to have minor dust and debris from the construction activities, while one area was found to have major dust and debris (greater than three square feet, per regulatory criteria).</p>
<p>All rooms found to contain dust and debris from the contractor were cleaned per regulatory standards, including HEPA-filtered vacuuming and surface wiping. Air samples were then collected in these rooms to verify that airborne asbestos concentrations were below the conservative criteria set for public K&#8211;12 schools. All air sample results were well below regulatory criteria.</p>
<p>In almost all areas, the plastic containment used during the cleaning process has been removed, restricted occupancy tags have been removed, and locks returned to their original keys (where applicable). The remaining areas, the Cowell dining hall and Stevenson event center, are expected to be released for resumption of regular activities early next week.</p>
<p><strong>Dining Services will require several days to prepare the Cowell dining hall and Stevenson coffee shop for regular service. At this time, service is expected to resume on Thursday, April 11.</strong></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Teens who choose to spend time alone may know what's best for them, according to new research that suggests solitude isn't a red flag for isolation or depression.</p>
<p>The key factor is choice, say researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Wilmington College: When solitude is imposed on adolescents and young adults, whether as punishment or as a result of social anxiety, it can be problematic. But chosen solitude contributes to personal growth and self-acceptance, they found.</p>
<p>"Solitude has gotten a lot of bad press, especially for adolescents who get labeled as social misfits or lonely," said Margarita Azmitia, professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz and coauthor of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197118301957?dgcid=rss_sd_all">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Adolescence</em>. "Sometimes, solitude is good. Developmentally, learning to be alone is a skill, and it can be refreshing and restorative."</p>
<p>Most previous studies confounded solitude with loneliness or shyness, said Azmitia. "There's a stigma for kids who spend time alone. They're considered lacking in social skills, or they get labeled 'loners,' " she said. "It's beneficial to know when you need to be alone and when you need to be with others. This study quantifies the benefits of solitude and distinguishes it from the costs of loneliness or isolation."</p>
<p>Virginia Thomas (PhD, '17, psychology), assistant professor of psychology at Wilmington College, spearheaded the research as a graduate student in Azmitia's lab, where she developed a specialization in the role of solitude in identity development and emotional wellbeing.</p>
<p>When adolescents and young adults choose to spend time alone, solitude can provide an opportunity for self-reflection, creative expression, or spiritual renewal. But it can be challenging when it is imposed on them&#8212;when they opt out of social engagement because they lack friends, feel awkward, experience social anxiety, or are being punished, said Thomas.</p>
<p>To distinguish between these motivations, Thomas and Azmitia developed a 14-item survey that asked respondents to rate their motivations for solitude on a four-point scale, posing questions like, "I feel energized when I spend time by myself," and "I enjoy the quiet," versus "I feel uncomfortable when I'm with others," and "I regret things I say or do when I&#8217;m with others."</p>
<p>"We got clear results that are pretty reliable indicators of adaptive versus maladaptive solitude," said Thomas. Those who seek solitude because they feel rejected or want to retreat into isolation are at greater risk of social anxiety, loneliness, and depression, and they tend to have lower levels of identity development, autonomy, and positive relationships with others. In contrast, those who seek solitude for positive reasons, such as self-reflection or a desire for peace and quiet, face none of these risks.</p>
<p>Today's fast-paced, device-driven culture emphasizes being connected to friends and associates 24/7, and young people have little practice learning to manage their time alone productively. Imposed solitude is more problematic for adolescents, who often worry about being rejected by their peers or friends or fear that being alone means they are unpopular. However, the capacity for solitude blossoms in young adults, the researchers found.</p>
<p>"These results increase our awareness that being alone can be restorative and a positive thing," said Thomas. "The question is how to be alone without feeling like we're missing out. For many people, solitude is like exercising a muscle they've never used. You have to develop it, flex it, and learn to use time alone to your benefit."</p>
<p>Solitude serves the same positive functions in introverts and extroverts. "Introverts just need more of it," noted Thomas.</p>
<p>"Our culture is pretty biased toward extroversion," she said. "When we see any sign of shyness or introversion in children, we worry they won't be popular. But we overlook plenty of well-adjusted teens and young adults who are perfectly happy when alone, and who benefit from their solitude."</p>
<p>Both researchers encouraged parents to appreciate the benefits of solitude for their children. "Parents can help their children understand that being alone isn't bad. It doesn't mean nobody likes you," said Azmitia. "Solitude can improve the wellbeing of kids who are overstimulated. They can learn to regulate their behavior, on their own, without being told to."</p>
<p>"We need to build our cultural understanding that we don't have to be social all the time," said Azmitia. "Sometimes alone time is good time."</p>

The cause of death was complications from a stroke he suffered in July 2017.</p>
<p>Machotka, who joined the faculty in 1970 and retired in 1994, was a leading scholar in the field of the psychology of aesthetics. His lifelong focus was the French painter Paul C&#233;zanne; he published two books about the artist, and lectured widely about the man and his working methods.</p>
<p>A painter himself, Machotka established an aesthetics studies major at UCSC. He served as provost of Porter College when it was known as College Five, and served as chair of the Psychology Department and of the Academic Senate in 1992-94. After retiring, Pavel and his wife, Nina, moved to Italy.&#160;</p>
<p>In 2015, Machotka won the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/machotka-panunzio.html">2015 Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award</a> that honors UC emeriti professors in the humanities and social sciences. He returned to campus to deliver a talk entitled, "Psychology and Art, and the Case of C&#233;zanne."</p>
<p>Machotka was born in Prague in 1936 shortly before the Nazi invasion. He fled Czechoslovakia with his family in 1948 after the Soviet communists took over. He attended the University of Chicago at age 16, where he first saw a C&#233;zanne painting.

<p>We have also notified Santa Cruz County Public Health and Cal/OSHA.</p>
<p>Our top priority continues to be the health and wellbeing of our campus community, and we are taking a cautious approach to evaluating this situation. The campus will share more information when it becomes available.</p>

<p>Multi-Factor Authentication</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is now available to self-enroll for all faculty, staff, and students. If you support faculty or are unavailable to sign up for MFA during your assigned time, we encourage you to enroll early.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>What is MFA?</p>
<p>UCSC is taking meaningful action to help students, faculty, and staff safeguard themselves against cybercrime. Multi-Factor Authentication, also known as two-step or 2-factor authentication, adds a second layer of protection to your UCSC account in addition to your username and password. This extra factor prevents anyone but you from logging in to your account.</p>

<p>Recently, the campus learned that a construction contractor installing wall-mounted cable enclosures in Cowell and Stevenson colleges drilled holes in walls whose underlying materials contain asbestos. Unfortunately, in some areas the contractor did not fully contain the dust and debris generated by this activity. This work began in August 2018.</p>
<p>Upon analyzing the dust and debris and confirming that it contained asbestos, the campus immediately closed off areas containing significant debris, as well as areas sharing the same air handling system. Subsequently, UCSC&#8217;s Physical Planning, Development and Operations (PPDO) and Environmental Health and Safety (EH&amp;S) departments conducted a comprehensive inspection of all areas where the contractor drilled into walls to install cable tray. These areas are all within Cowell and Stevenson colleges. This information is now informing our response and clean up.</p>
<p>The inspections revealed numerous areas with minor contamination below acceptable regulatory thresholds (less than three square feet of surface contamination). As a prudent measure, a certified asbestos abatement contractor will clean any residue in these areas. This work will be completed by April 5, 2019.</p>
<p>The area of greatest debris contamination occurs along a 34-foot stretch of wall connecting the Stevenson servery area and the Stevenson Event Center costume room. These areas, as well as the adjacent kitchen, dining hall, Event Center and other areas served by the same air handling system, will remain closed until a certified asbestos abatement contractor can thoroughly clean all impacted areas in accordance with regulatory guidelines. This work will take several weeks and a completion date is not currently determined.</p>
<p>Although the construction contractor did work in residential areas, the work in these areas did not disturb asbestos-containing materials. No asbestos abatement is needed in the Cowell or Stevenson residential areas.</p>
<p>Although initially closed, the lower level of the Cowell and Stevenson Student Commons were not impacted by this asbestos contamination. These areas do not have asbestos-containing wall coatings, are physically separated from the contaminated areas, and have their own ventilation system. They were reopened for occupancy on Monday, March 25, 2019.</p>
<p>A list of all the rooms and their status will soon be available online at <a href="https://ucsc.edu/cowell-closure">ucsc.edu/cowell-closure</a>. The list will be updated regularly as more areas re-open.</p>
<p>Asbestos is a naturally occurring material, and small amounts are often present in the air outside. For more information on potential health effects associated with asbestos exposure, see the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) page online at <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/asbestos/">https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/asbestos/</a></p>
<p>If you have health concerns and would like medical follow up, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1urw-hARxEz05QCyIWt4mmRQUAsSf1LTn2ySBtiQBJKQ/edit?usp=sharing_eil&amp;ts=5c952d43">complete this form</a> so that we can direct your inquiry appropriately.</p>
<p>I realize that hearing about this situation may be concerning to many members of our community. Please know that campus leadership, including staff from PPDO and EH&amp;S, are working hard to coordinate the response to this situation and to address any questions or needs that you may have. Please direct any additional questions to <a href="mailto:cowell-closure@ucsc.edu">cowell-closure@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>

Only a few piles will be burned each day, due to staffing. Smoke is not expected to be noticeable on main campus. All piles will be extinguished before Cal Fire leaves the area.&#160;<br/><br/>Pile burns are tightly controlled and typically produce less smoke than prescribed burns. However, persons susceptible to smoke are advised to avoid the area.<br/><br/>Santa Cruz County has not experienced a major wildfire in recent years, but devastating fires throughout California this past fall remind us we all must do our part to prevent them. That includes controlling vegetation in and around campus. The pile burns are part of that effort.&#160;<br/><br/>For more information, please visit our <a href="https://oes.ucsc.edu/emergency-management/preparedness/hazard-resources/wildland-fires.html#https://oes.ucsc.edu/emergency-management/preparedness/hazard-resources/wildland-fires.html">wildland fire resource page</a> online.&#160;</div></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c176964a8072701734bebd3cfc79af98"><name>inspired-expeditions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Inspired Expeditions: A travel program for the curious</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz’s new travel program pairs travelers with expert professors for enhanced perspectives into some of the world’s most fascinating places.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine visiting the ancient burial grounds of Saqqara with an Egyptologist who has created an intricate 3D model of the site, including a labyrinth where the mummified bodies of sacred bulls are interred and the tomb of Pharaoh Unas, which is filled with written magical spells to help him become immortal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or consider exploring London&#8217;s diverse culture, including its rich theater scene, with someone who has spent his academic life studying British playwrights, authors, and poets. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are just two of the experiences being offered by a new UC Santa Cruz alumni travel program that will link travelers with some of the campus&#8217;s best and brightest professors for a deep dive into a trove of fascinating places. Called </span><a href="http://travel.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired Expeditions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the program has five trips planned, from Egypt and London to the Galapagos, Okinawa, and Chile, starting in October of this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We find our alumni often travel by themselves, but the value we add, the mission we have (with these trips), is combining and highlighting our faculty expertise and really showcasing that,&#8221; said Nichole Silva, director of Strategic Travel and Experiences at UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While local guides will be hired for all the trips, she said, faculty leaders will provide two lectures, suggest before-trip readings, answer questions on site, and provide a unique travel experience that doesn&#8217;t just involve drive-by views of landscapes and churches. The Galapagos trip, for instance, will be led by Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Dan Costa, who has studied marine mammals and seabirds from the Galapagos to Antarctica and will share his knowledge of creatures found only at the location, from flightless cormorants to fur seals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit of these trips, said Silva, &#8220;is the educational component, with our faculty providing context and perspective that maybe you wouldn&#8217;t get from local guides.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020 for instance, Assistant Professor of History Elaine Sullivan will lead her group to the ancient burial grounds of Saqqara near Giza. Sullivan, who is just finishing the creation of a 3D model of the site as it evolved over 2,500 years, will provide commentary and insights as alumni walk through the monumental tombs built for kings and other elites. The tour will include a rare visit to the burial chamber of Pharaoh Unas with its carved star ceiling and 283 written magical spells to help the king join his divine father, the Sun God Ra, in the afterlife. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You feel like you&#8217;re in a place outside of the world,&#8221; said Sullivan, who has been traveling to Egypt for work and study since 1997. &#8220;Unas&#8217;s burial chamber was just recently reopened after a restoration by the Supreme Council of Antiquities. I&#8217;m really excited to see it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She will also take alumni to Cairo and on a Nile cruise to see temples and the beautifully painted and carved tombs of ancient Thebans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This kind of trip will really focus on cultural heritage, archeology, and history in an intense way,&#8221; Sullivan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Professor of Literature and Porter College Provost Sean Keilen will take alumni not only to the British Museum and The Globe Theater on a 2020 trip to London, but also to a contemporary play at the National Theater, and to the famous Borough Market, which will give visitors a literal taste of the ethnic and cultural diversity in the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was trained in English literature, and I&#8217;ve lived in London for long periods twice. In designing the trip, I wanted to focus on the famous places that visitors to the city love to explore&#8212;the museums, monuments, theaters, and stately homes&#8212;but I also want to help them discover London as it is now: culturally diverse, cosmopolitan, and in the process of reassessing its relationship to itself and the rest of the world,&#8221;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said Keilen, who is director of the UC Santa Cruz Shakespeare Workshop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, not only will the group see a Shakespeare play, but also Keilen will talk about the times when Shakespeare was writing, a period of unprecedented changes in religion, politics, science, and the expressive capacity of English as a language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shakespeare had an uncanny ability to take advantage of the creative opportunities that were unleashed with the chaos of these changes,&#8221; Keilen said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also plans to make time for travelers who wish to immerse themselves in local culture with visits to an area pub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s no better way to get to know a London neighborhood than to spend an hour in a pub,&#8221; Keilen said. &#8220;A pub is not just a bar. In Britain, a pub is a close cousin of the market square, the public park, and the village church: a meeting point where Londoners go to be with each other and talk about their shared concerns.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we planned these trips, we were looking for the perfect storm,&#8221; Silva said. &#8220;We wanted destinations people could be excited about, research people can understand, and faculty who are dynamic and excited when they talk about the work they are doing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other trip leaders include Assistant Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics Ryan Foley, who will take visitors to various observatory sites before they witness a total solar eclipse in December 2020; and Professor of History and Cowell College Provost Alan Christy, who will lead a tour to Okinawa that will include a visit to caves that were once forts, an exploration of military bases and the American occupation of the island, plus a chance to sample local cuisine and learn to dance to traditional Okinawan music.</span></p>

'Question Bridge: Black Males' exhibition </article-subhead><article-text><p>Students, faculty, and community leaders will respond to questions and issues raised by <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/02/question-bridge-sesnon.html"><strong><em>Question Bridge: Black Males</em></strong></a>&#8212;an exhibition currently on display at the Sesnon Gallery&#8212;at a &#8220;Blueprint Roundtable&#8221; on April 3 at Oakes College.</p>
<p>The participants will include Santa Cruz city councilmember Drew Glover, UCSC professor of history David Anthony, academic counselor Abiel Russom, retired Watsonville teacher JJ Porter, and UCSC undergraduate student Jason Harper, who will discuss the complexities of being black and male in the U.S.</p>
<p>Designed to foster dialogue between black men across generations, the roundtable provides an opportunity for young black students to pose questions to black men of older generations.</p>
<p>The discussion will be moderated by artist Chris Johnson, who originated the Question Bridge concept with a 1996 video installation he created for the Museum of Photographic Arts and the Malcolm X library in San Diego, California.</p>
<p>&#8220;I created the Question Bridge Blueprint Roundtable format of community engagement in response to one poignant question that came directly from the QB project,&#8221; said Johnson.&#160;&#8220;The question was from a hip hop generation man who, speaking to members of the Civil Rights generation asked: &#8216;I know that you look down on us for the way we behave, and yes, we&#8217;ve made many mistakes. But, why didn&#8217;t you leave us a blueprint?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowing that this is a prevalent question among young and elder Black males everywhere, I thought it would be important for members of various communities to have a tangible way to speak back to the Question Bridge installation projects by addressing questions that exist between generations of Black males everywhere,&#8221; said Johnson.&#160;</p>
<p>That question became the catalyst for multigenerational discussions across the country about local barriers to communication between Black males; values, and strategies for overcoming social issues that have emerged in local communities over the past four decades.</p>
<p>These roundtables have taken place in venues ranging from the Oakland Museum to the Brooklyn Museum to the Atlanta Civic Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;The questions range from &#8216;heavy issues&#8217; like the blame that both elders and youths feel that the other is projecting at them due to the breakdown of marginalized Black families and youth violence in Black communities everywhere, to &#8216;lighter&#8217; issues like: &#8216;How can I learn to tie a tie if I don&#8217;t have a father or grandfather in my home?&#8217; said Johnson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that the questions are both universal, like the ones about Black on Black violence, and local, like when a Black man on the Wesleyan Campus commented on how he was welcomed on campus as a student but ostracized as a non-student,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Both the roundtable event and the Question Bridge multimedia exhibition are presented by the campus&#8217;s Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery in partnership with the Institute of the Arts and Sciences (IAS) at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted that the Question Bridge: Black Males exhibition at the Sesnon Gallery has generated so much interest among students, faculty and community members,&#8221; noted Sesnon director Shelby Graham. &#8220;With the collaboration of IAS, we've served over 500 students from UC Santa Cruz, Cabrillo College, Watsonville High and surrounding schools, with group and individual tours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are hoping the live format of the Blueprint Roundtable at Oakes College will generate local and interactive forms of participation in the project using the same engaging intergenerational questioning format as the video installation,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is an exciting way to start the spring quarter with safe and critical discussions on race, humanity, and American Identity."&#160;</p>
<p>The gallery exhibition, which opened at the beginning of February, will run until April 6.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Having&#160;Question Bridge&#160;here on campus is an amazing teaching opportunity,&#8221; added John Weber, director of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Blueprint Roundtable event we are planning here will allow for wide-ranging questions and dialogue. Chris Johnson has done programs like this at a number of the many showings the piece has had nationally, and they have been deeply meaningful, integral aspects of the exhibitions,&#8221; said Weber.</p>
<p>The April 3 Blueprint Roundtable begins at 6:30 p.m. with a reception and screening at Oakes Learning Center, located on campus at Oakes College. The discussion starts at 7 p.m. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>

<p>The Cool Campus Challenge motivates campus communities to support the UC Carbon Neutrality Initiative, launched by UC President Janet Napolitano in 2013, with the primary aim of the university achieving carbon neutrality by 2025.</p>
<p>The goal of this friendly online competition is for the university community to engage in a culture of sustainability and environment-friendly practices. All students, faculty and staff can contribute to this effort by registering at CoolCampusChallenge.org, and taking actions to reduce their environmental impact. Participants earn points for each action they take.</p>
<p>The campuses with the most points and greatest percent of participation at the end of the competition on April 26 will be crowned the &#8220;Coolest UC Campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we did this contest in 2015, UCSC participants saved 2,655 metric tons of CO2 equivalent, that&#8217;s more emissions than over 560 passenger vehicles driven for one year.&#8221; Said Sustainability Director Elida Erickson. &#8220;This is a great tool for teaching folks tangible steps they can take to make a significant difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each week, the challenge will highlight actions participants can take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change, such as shutting off computer monitors that are not in use or taking public transportation.</p>
<p>Both individuals and teams can compete to win, and multiple prizes will be awarded. In addition to earning points for taking suggested actions, participants can earn even more points by coming up with their own creative ideas for reducing their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>UC and the Center for Sustainable Energy are proud to sponsor the Cool Campus Challenge and encourages all Californians to take measures that save energy, reduce carbon emissions and lead efforts to combat climate change in California.

She was intimidated by the checkpoints, barbed wire, and clanking gates.</p>
<p>But when she entered the prison chapel and saw 28 incarcerated men waiting eagerly to greet each of their UC Santa Cruz counterparts with a handshake, she felt a wave of positive emotions wash over her.</p>
<p>"The men looked me in the eye. They were so excited. They radiated warmth and the power of hope," she recalled. "I felt welcomed."</p>
<p>And so began a first-ever class called "Transcommunal Cooperation and Peacemaking," a joint endeavor of UC Santa Cruz, College Ten, Soledad Prison, and Barrios Unidos, a Santa Cruz-based youth-violence prevention program.</p>
<p>For ten weeks, 14 undergraduates and 28 Soledad students studied and discussed writings about nonviolence, racism, colonialism, toxic masculinity, and poverty. They examined cases of peacemaking and social justice movements in Northern Ireland, Sudan, the United States, and elsewhere. By all accounts, it was an extraordinary quarter. Lee wrote after that first meeting that it left her feeling "the most empowered that I have ever felt in my entire career of social justice."</p>
<p>"It takes a lot of courage to come into a prison and sit behind locked doors for four hours with people convicted of very serious crimes," said Professor Emeritus of Sociology John Brown Childs, who taught the class. "These men are tired of violence. They don't want to do it anymore. They emphasize nonviolence and peacemaking. This is about redemption and transformation and being able to be compassionate about others."</p>
<p>Childs pioneered the theory of <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/book/9473">transcommunality</a> and sees it as a way to bring people from diverse backgrounds together to overcome stereotypes and build mutual respect&#8212;without trying to change minds or "convert" anyone in the process.</p>
<p>"It's about people being able to work together from different perspectives and learning through interaction," said Childs. "It's not a melting pot approach. It's a cooperative approach."</p>
<p><strong>A classroom behind prison walls</strong></p>
<p>Childs has taught transcommunal peacemaking in local prisons for 13 years through Barrios Unidos's Prison Project. His students at Soledad went on to form their own ongoing educational group of "peace warriors," the Cemanahuac/One World Cultural Group, to reach fellow inmates and support each other in their quest for redemption.</p>
<p>It was Enrique Rivera, a facilitator of the group, who suggested a joint class with UCSC students. "Just the act of being together is a form of shared practical action," said Childs, who teamed up with Bruce Schumm, a professor of physics, and Flora Lu, a professor of environmental studies and provost of Colleges Nine and Ten, to bring the class to life. "This course is a way for people to turn hope into actuality."</p>
<p>With growing concern among UCSC students about mass incarceration and the prison industrial complex, this two-unit class offered undergraduates something quite different. Interest was high&#8212;students had to apply to take the class&#8212;and almost every applicant had some personal experience with the criminal justice system. Alyssa Scarsciotti, a third-year majoring in sociology and linguistics, works closely with incarcerated men and women as the director of ART Initiative, a student-run program that brings art classes to the Santa Cruz Main Jail and the Blaine Street Facility.</p>
<p>"It might sound scary to go into jail and sit next to inmates, but it's humanizing," she said. "It's powerful for both sides."</p>
<p>The two groups met together three times&#8212;a lockdown prevented the planned fourth session&#8212;and assigned readings were the "launching point" for in-depth discussions.</p>
<p>"They would grill you on the reading," Scarsciotti said of her counterparts at the Correctional Training Facility (CTF). "They really wanted to know what you were thinking. They are engaging. They are thinking deeply about this."</p>
<p>The men in this self-selected group are committed to the path of peace, but the prison environment poses daily challenges. During a discussion about gang violence and a recent riot that had prompted the lockdown, one inmate said, "For us, living a peaceful life in prison is dangerous. If you choose to be peaceful in the midst of chaos, someone will notice."</p>
<p>That stayed with Lee. "I took it for granted that I practice nonviolence in my daily life," she said. "For them, it's a risk."</p>
<p>Scarsciotti recalled one class during which a CTF student described his childhood experience of being steeped in violence. "His parents taught him to fight back," she said. Pointing to a copy of Childs's book, <em>Transcommunality: From the Politics of Conversion to the Ethics of Respect</em>, he said, "<em>This</em>. No one taught me <em>this</em>."</p>
<p>The classes were always memorable, and sometimes extraordinary, like the night a man apologized to a fellow inmate for murdering his best friend&#8212;the crime that led to his incarceration.</p>
<p>"It was really hard for him to apologize, and he did it in front of everyone," said Scarsciotti. "It was a cathartic moment. His apology was accepted. He was forgiven. It was a really emotional class."</p>
<p><strong>Connecting across difference</strong></p>
<p>The class impressed upon Scarsciotti the scope of need inside prisons. Many of the CTF students have been convicted of violent crimes, and most are unlikely to ever experience life outside of prison. That doesn't mean they stop craving opportunities to express themselves, connect with others, and to grow as individuals.</p>
<p>"Education is a phenomenal outlet. So is art," she said. "It should be available to everyone. I try to view them as humans who need a resource, just like every one of us."</p>
<p>For Childs, the class exceeded his expectations. "Sure, I wondered how we were going to talk to each other&#8212;college students and incarcerated men. But it was the best class I've ever had," he said. "It was purposeful. It was a rich learning experience."</p>
<p>Childs was struck by the discovery of surprising common ground between college seniors, who are nervous about "re-entry" after graduation, and CTF students, who wonder whether, and how, they might one day re-enter society. They experience stress, regret, and guilt as they struggle to live each day with what they've done.</p>
<p>Physics Professor Bruce Schumm, who co-taught the course with Childs, has volunteered at Soledad for several years, so he was familiar with the deep appreciation inmates feel for anyone who takes the time to visit them. "Their lives are very constrained," he said. "To have people come in and see their value, sense their worth, and treat them as valuable members of society is a gift."</p>
<p>Still, this class brought out something Schumm hadn't seen before. "The men were so excited. One shared that he was unable to sleep the night before," he recalled.</p>
<p>"Soledad is probably the least cynical place I've ever been, other than a hospital nursery," said Schumm. "Through the work the men in this class are doing, they come to see the potential and the promise in the evolution of the human spirit."</p>
<p><strong>Grateful for homework</strong></p>
<p>In personal reflections about the class that they shared with Childs, the CTF students expressed deep appreciation.</p>
<p>"I loved it," one wrote. "Being in the chapel, having great discussions about a homework assignment, made me feel more normal than I have for 12 years."</p>
<p>A man who has been incarcerated for two decades&#8212;"over 80 percent of my life"&#8212;marveled at the ease with which the UCSC students interacted with their CTF classmates, saying he had expected them to be nervous, uncomfortable, and judgmental, based in part on media stereotypes of prisons and inmates. "There was no judgment. They were comfortable and saw us as students, as humans," he wrote. "(The opportunity) has restored my hope. Thank you. I wish we had more time."</p>
<p>Another recalled that he had expected to feel embarrassed when the UCSC students walked in. "But when I shook hands with each college student, I remembered. I am human. I settled in and enjoyed the minds."</p>
<p>Flora Lu, provost of Colleges Nine and Ten, attended the three class sessions at Soledad. A strong advocate of co-curricular engagement with off-campus groups and organizations, she was moved by the transformations she saw the undergraduates experience. This class gave them an opportunity to see incarcerated men "as whole people&#8212;thoughtful, kind, and deeply redeemable," she said.</p>
<p>Lu also saw the CTF students buoyed, recalling one who told the UCSC group, "When you are here, I forget that I am in prison."</p>
<p>"Being there, time would stand still and fly by simultaneously," Lu recalled. "We all hold different knowledge from our lived experiences. People just seemed incredibly present. I was often moved to tears."</p>
<p>Lu, whose unit provided logistical and administrative support for the class, hopes it will be offered annually. Childs, too, is hopeful that this class will become the foundation of greater UCSC engagement with Soledad. He thanked university and prison administrators, including Lt. Roland Ramon at CTF and Roberta Schweers, the CTF civilian sponsor of the class, as well as his faculty colleagues and the Cemanahuac group at CTF, for making the class possible. He acknowledged all the students, whose hard work made the class so successful, and singled out alum <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/chavez-convocation.html">Daniel "Nane" Alejandrez</a>, founder of Barrios Unidos and the Prison Project, for being the visionary force behind the class.</p>
<p>"So many people played different roles," he said. "I'm interested in socially valuable education, and that's what this class represents. It's about creating social justice and equality."</p>

In Spring 2018, the Student Ballot included Measure 69, which proposed increasing the Student Transit Fee in order to maintain transit service to, and throughout, campus. Unfortunately, Measure 69 failed.</span></p>
