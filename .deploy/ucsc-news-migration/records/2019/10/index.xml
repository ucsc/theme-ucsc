<p dir="ltr"><strong>Information about registered sex offenders</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Pursuant to the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, institutions of higher education must annually provide the campus community with how law enforcement agency information concerning registered sex offenders may be obtained.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The State of California requires sex offenders to register with the police department in the jurisdiction in which they reside. The state makes this information available to law enforcement agencies. This information is available to the public at the local police/sheriff's department. For the UC Santa Cruz campus, information on registered sex offenders is available at the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office, 701 Ocean St., Santa Cruz, CA 95060, 831-454-2242.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Additionally, the Federal Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act provides for the tracking of convicted sex offenders enrolled at or employed at institutions of higher education.</span></p>

The terms "employed or carries on a vocation" include employment whether or not financially compensated, volunteered, or performed for government or educational benefit. The registrant shall also notify the UC Santa Cruz Police Department within five working days of ceasing to be enrolled or employed, or ceasing to carry on a vocation.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>California mandatory reporting laws</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As outlined by Penal Code &#167;368 and Welfare and Institutions Code &#167;15600 et al., the California Legislature enacted recent laws to require elderly and dependent adult care custodians, health practitioners, Adult Protective Services staff, law enforcement, and other designated agencies to report and to investigate incidents of abuse/neglect. The categories of abuse and neglect that must be reported by mandated parties now include: physical, sexual, financial, isolation, abandonment, abduction, neglect, mental suffering, and self-neglect.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>California Penal Code &#167;11160 requires prompt, mandatory reporting to the local law enforcement agency by healthcare practitioners (such as those at the Cowell Student Health Center) when they provide medical services to a person they know or reasonably suspect is suffering from wounds inflicted by a firearm or as a result of assaultive or abusive conduct.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Child Abuse Neglect and Reporting Act (CANRA), codified in California Penal Code &#167;&#167;11164-11174.3, requires that employers of mandated reporters (as defined in the Act) promote identification and reporting of child abuse or neglect. It is the policy of the University of California to comply with its obligations under the Act; to require that all university employees and administrators who are mandated reporters make required reports to child protection or law enforcement agencies; and, more broadly, to encourage all members of the university community who observe, have actual knowledge of, or reasonably suspect child abuse or neglect at a university facility or perpetrated by university personnel to promptly report the concern to appropriate law enforcement, external officials and university officials.

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Student Safety Bill (AB 1433)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Pursuant to California Education Code &#160;&#167;&#167;67380(a)(6)(A), 67381 and 67383(a), the UC Santa Cruz Police Department must report immediately or as soon as practicably possible to the appropriate local law enforcement agency, all reports received by a campus security authority (CSA) of any Part 1 violent crime, sexual assault, or hate crime, committed on or off campus. This includes reports victims make directly to CSAs as well as reports victims make to other University employees that are then conveyed to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department or other CSAs.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Such reports will include, when the victim has consented to being identified:</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A disturbing video captured the murders of several women and young children in a remote African village, and yet the perpetrators were free. That was all a team of investigators needed to dig in, using satellite imagery, tips, news reports, and determination to identify where the atrocity took place, when, and by whom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When confronted by BBC News with the team's findings, the government of Cameroon arrested seven members of the military who are currently under investigation for the murder. That dramatic case from 2018 illustrates the impact digital investigators can have on allegations of human rights violations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emerging field of "digital verification," which is taking hold in newsrooms and nonprofits around the globe, is now taking root at UC Santa Cruz. The new</span><a href="https://rca.ucsc.edu/directors-initiatives/human-rights-lab/index.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Rights Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> went live this fall with 16 undergraduates and three graduate students who have made a three-quarter commitment to mastering high-tech tools and investigating alleged human rights abuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need to verify digital information gained attention this summer when images of fires burning in the Amazon rainforest went viral&#8212;and then high-profile celebrities and politicians were called out for tweeting and sharing</span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/08/amazon-viral-fire-photos-fake-misleading-leonardo-dicaprio/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">misleading, outdated images</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has established its own digital verification unit, Amnesty International has partnered with university-based teams to advance its mission, and the United Nations and the International Criminal Court have relied on open-source evidence for holding perpetrators accountable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"There's a new stream of careers in journalism, law, and with advocacy organizations that need people trained in open source tools," said lab director Sylvanna Falc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#243;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n, a professor of Latin American and Latino studies (LALS) and a human rights researcher.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#243;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n was inspired by a similar lab that opened at UC Berkeley three years ago. That "</span><a href="https://humanrights.berkeley.edu/programs-projects/tech/investigations-lab"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sister lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" is affiliated with Berkeley Law, while UCSC's lab will be aligned with the mission of the Research Center for the Americas, which Falc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#243;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n directs. Students have expressed interest in probing allegations of human rights violations in U.S.-Mexico border detention facilities, she said, explaining that Google Earth, maps, and media reports can help investigators monitor and verify what's happening on the border.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Too many qualified undergrads"</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#243;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n had intended to accept 10 undergraduates this year but was overwhelmed by the quality of applicants and enrolled 16; three graduate student researchers are providing support and serving as mentors to the undergrads. Falc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#243;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n enrolled in a five-day training in open source investigations by Bellingcat, a leader in the field, and she and the students received two days of training at UC Berkeley from Amnesty International&#8217;s Digital Verification Corps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#243;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n has thoughtfully designed a class framework that will foster teamwork and be responsive to the well-being of students: Three undergraduate managers will lead their teams, which are encouraged to brainstorm how to approach each case, or alleged violation of human rights. Each undergraduate manager has also been paired with an undergrad from the UCB lab. Independent work will complement weekly lab sessions in the Digital Scholars Commons of McHenry Library, and a weekly seminar will bring the whole group together for "face time," as well as what Falc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#243;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n calls "resiliency exercises."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Some of these materials can be hard to view, especially watching violence repeatedly to verify the material, and we don't want anyone experiencing secondary trauma," she said, adding that the class offers a "tailored seminar, research experience, and attention you can't get at a larger institution."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josue Perez, a senior majoring in sociology, jumped at the opportunity to apply for the class. "At UCSC, in a lot of the classes you get exposed to injustices around the world," he said. "This lab was a follow-up to learning about those. I learned about injustice, and now I'm doing something about it."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perez, a team leader, described the first digital-verification exercise his team was given as practice. Shown a photo of a WalMart parking lot with stores nearby and mountains in the background, the students were tasked with finding its exact location. Over the course of half an hour or so, the team used open-source tools to analyze images, search addresses, and even read restaurant reviews&#8212;one of which listed the address, which turned out to be in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. "It was fun," he recalled. "The team was bouncing ideas off each other."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This class is different from typical, structured university courses with exams and set assignments, and he's looking forward to the challenge of solving real-world cases. "I'm optimistic we'll complete our investigation and provide our partner with the best information we can," he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-day training included instruction on steps students can take to protect themselves online, how to monitor their digital footprints, mask their locations when working off-campus, and communicate across secure channels. And they received strict instructions about maintaining confidentiality. "They told us how to talk about our work with family and friends, to maintain security and protect the program," said Perez. "We can't have leaks. I appreciate that there's been so much effort to keep us safe and to keep the program safe."</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verify first, then investigate</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Berkeley lab has partnerships with Amnesty International and other high-profile organizations, and Falc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#243;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n has established a partnership with the Center for Climate Crime Analysis (CCCA) based in The Hague, The Netherlands. CCCA is focused on the climate crisis and its board members are affiliated with the International Criminal Court and the United Nations. The names of other UCSC's partners are being kept confidential for now at their request. But the process begins when a partner presents the team with a "case"&#8212;materials that must be verified and investigated. That's when the forensic analysis begins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step of any investigation is preservation. Once the public records, photos, videos, or social media posts have been secured, the teams will use open-source tools to verify them. Such tools reveal details like when a digital image was first created, when it was uploaded to the internet, and how many times it has been "pinned." The next step is deciding what information to go after next, and creating a flowchart to track the team's process. At the end of each probe, the team will prepare a report for the partner agency, which will use the report to advance its work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Cases are confidential and we won't be able to discuss them until they've been completed," said Falc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#243;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n. &#8220;We want to remember the work is not about us, but about&#8212;and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;those who are being adversely affected by injustice. We have a responsibility to protect them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoselyne Cerros, a second-year students at Oakes College, is majoring in LALS and politics and thinking about law school after graduation. "This class is directly relevant to my path," she said. "I'm interested in doing hands-on work with human rights violations and helping in any way I can."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cerros hadn't heard about open-source digital verification until Falc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#243;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n announced the creation of the lab during a class last spring. She grew up around technology and said she's not worried about picking up new skills. "I can adapt to technology very well," she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up near the U.S.-Mexico border sensitized Cerros to immigration-related abuses. "I always see ICE patrolling around underclass neighborhoods," she said. "It's crazy they can stop you because you 'look like an immigrant.' It seems very racist. My intention is to help underprivileged people."</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">"When activists speak up, they face consequences"</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since she was in high school, Kayla Gomez has been interested in human rights work. As a senior, she spent three weeks in the Dominican Republic learning about local nongovernmental organizations, and last December she worked alongside the community to help build a school in Haiti. Seeing the effects of political corruption, and the struggles of average people, had an impact. "Right now in Haiti, people are rioting because the president isn't doing his job," she said. "He's very corrupt. There are marches and protests, and the military has been trained to kill activists."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, as a second-year majoring in politics, Gomez is eager to give back. "We have a lot of privileges&#8212;safety, access to information," she said. "I want to learn how to access this information that's available to us to help somebody else."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gomez is particularly concerned about the wellbeing of journalists in hot spots around the world. "When activists speak up, they face consequences, and a lot of times, journalists are murdered," she said, adding that she appreciates the security precautions the lab is employing. "When people start looking for the truth, trying to hold people accountable, they can get in trouble. People come after the people coming after them."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The training at Berkeley was inspiring. "They've only been going for three years, so to see the potential our lab has was really cool," said Gomez, who's also a fellow of the</span><a href="http://www.everettprogram.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Everett Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a student-led initiative that uses information technology to promote social change. The Human Rights Lab received start-up funds from the</span><a href="https://santacruzinstitute.ucsc.edu/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz Institute for Social Transformation</span></a>, as well as financial support from the <a href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/">Division of Graduate Studies</a> and <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/#slide1">The Humanities Institute</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We are a research university, and we're doing research," said Gomez, who plans to join the Peace Corps after graduation next year. "It's important to be able to say, 'Here's what I did.'"</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illegal mining, deforestation, and tracking the money</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graduate student Alejandra Watanabe Farro, a first-year doctoral student in Latin American and Latino studies, is eager to explore human rights violations associated with environmental issues, including illegal gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon. "It has atrocious consequences on the forest and rivers, which impacts indigenous and local people, and it brings a host of problems: trafficking, sexual exploitation of children, and other human rights violations," she said. "Local communities and grassroots organizations don't have the tools to make a case out of violations."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deforestation leaves a trail that investigators can follow, from logging roads to sales records. "You can track the money using these methods," she said, adding that airplanes and ocean-going vessels are required to file public records, which also offer valuable clues about illegal activity. "The potential is huge. These are tools organizations in Latin America will find very useful."</span></p>

The gift, which will be made in annual installments over the next ten years, establishes the Healthier World Fund for the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.</p>
<p>"We are delighted to announce this major gift and grateful to the donors for their generosity. UC Santa Cruz has long been a leader in genomics research, and the Genomics Institute is now poised to rapidly innovate in extraordinary new ways to address some of the most important issues of our time," said UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive.</p>
<p>The pledge from the anonymous donor was made in partnership with campus leaders who have committed one-time funding of $1.7 million for facility upgrades and moving costs associated with the relocation of the Genomics Institute to 2300 Delaware Ave., and $650,000 annually for the next ten years to support the Genomics Institute's operating budget.</p>
<p>"It's a substantial step forward for us to have this kind of long-term funding," said David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering and director of the Genomics Institute. "This wonderful gift coincides with major new grants from the National Institutes of Health and our official establishment as an organized research unit of the campus. It feels like the culmination of 20 years of genomics work here at UC Santa Cruz."</p>
<p>Working with the international Human Genome Project in 2000, Haussler's team assembled the first working draft of the human genome sequence and posted it on the internet. The sequencing of the human genome sparked a revolution in biomedical research, and the UCSC Genomics Institute remains at the forefront of that revolution. Its researchers are recognized as world leaders in genomics, creating advanced technologies and open-source genomics platforms to unravel evolutionary patterns, molecular processes, and the underpinnings of disease.</p>
<p>The funds from the gift will be used to support a wide range of cutting-edge research projects at the Genomics Institute. Some of the funds will also support genomics-based interdisciplinary efforts involving the social sciences, arts, humanities, engineering, and physical and biological sciences.</p>
<p>Genome sequencing and the applications of genomics in clinical medicine have been a major focus of the institute's researchers. While genomics promises to revolutionize medicine, it also raises questions about issues of privacy, consent, social justice, and the genetic future of humanity and of Earth's ecosystems. Advances in genomics must address both scientific and societal questions, and the Genomics Institute aims to integrate the work of genome scientists with that of scholars in the social sciences, arts, and humanities.</p>
<p>In addition to medical applications, researchers at the institute are using genomics to understand the evolution of life on Earth and to inform efforts to conserve and protect endangered species. Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and associate director of the Genomics Institute, is a leader in the field of paleogenomics, using ancient DNA to study evolutionary history and the effects of environmental change on species and ecosystems. Shapiro helped launch the <a href="https://ucconservationgenomics.eeb.ucla.edu/">UC Conservation Genomics Consortium</a>, and she and other UCSC researchers are also involved in the Genome 10K Project, which Haussler helped launch and which aims to sequence the genomes of at least 10,000 vertebrate species.</p>
<p>"Conservation genomics can help us understand the biodiversity of life on this planet&#8212;what we have, what we're losing, and how we can save it," Shapiro said.</p>
<p>The Genomics Institute is involved in a wide range of large, collaborative projects, including several cancer genomics projects, such as the <a href="https://treehousegenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative</a>, and a major new genome sequencing project called the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/pangenome-project.html">Human Pangenome Reference Sequence Project</a>. The institute's DNA sequencing center will deploy advanced sequencing technologies, including nanopore sequencing pioneered at UCSC, to sequence human genomes at an unprecedented level of accuracy and completeness.</p>
<p>The Genomics Institute is also building the computational infrastructure for the global <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/04/czi-grants.html">Human Cell Atlas</a>, an effort to map every type of cell in the healthy human body, and they have launched an innovative effort to learn how the human brain evolved and how its neural circuitry develops using AI and cerebral organoid technology.</p>
<p>Based in the Baskin School of Engineering, the Genomics Institute brings together staff and faculty in all five campus divisions. The institute moved its headquarters over the summer to renovated office and laboratory space in the campus-owned complex at 2300 Delaware Ave. on the west side of Santa Cruz. The site now hosts about 80 of the institute&#8217;s researchers and technical and administrative staff, and plans for the site include the new genome sequencing center and other laboratory facilities.</p>
<p>"This generous gift will support the important work Genomics Institute researchers are doing to understand cancer and other diseases, develop global data-sharing standards, inform conservation efforts, and much more," said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering.

<p dir="ltr"><span>No final decisions have been made on outage areas, but it is possible our main campus, Coastal Science Campus, and Scotts Valley Center will be affected. Campus leaders have been monitoring the situation throughout the day, and our Office of Emergency Services has been in close communication with the Santa Cruz County Office of Emergency Services, which is working with PG&amp;E officials on outage planning.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>While an exact time for any power shutoff is unknown, it could be as early as the wee hours of Wednesday. This is the first time PG&amp;E has done a large-scale power shutdown &#8212; it is being referred to as a Public Safety Power Shutoff &#8212; and the utility is not saying how long power might be out, only that it could be up to five days before all users have power restored.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If our main campus loses power, some parts of campus should remain online, powered by our cogeneration plant, while some buildings have backup generators in place to supply emergency lighting. Several buildings would be without power. Campus officials are currently working on various contingency plans depending on what unfolds. Please keep your eyes open for additional campus messages Tuesday with more outage news.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Outage planning</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the interim, PG&amp;E has assembled some online resources that explain a Public Safety Power Shutoff, how best to prepare for one, and what areas might be affected.</span></p>

<p>Bone marrow transplants, used mostly in the treatment of cancer, are life-saving procedures to restore the stem cells that generate new blood cells throughout a person's life. These blood-forming cells (called "hematopoietic stem cells") normally reside only in the bone marrow. Obtaining them for transplants originally required drilling into the hip bone and using a special needle to remove cells directly from the bone marrow. Now it is more common to collect the cells from the blood, using drugs to get the stem cells to move from the bone marrow into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>The standard drug regimen for coaxing stem cells from the marrow to the bloodstream requires daily injections of the growth factor GCSF for several days before the stem cells can be collected, typically after 4 to 6 days of GCSF injections. Although less invasive than extracting cells directly from the bone marrow, this regimen is not always successful, often causes bone pain and other side effects, and cannot be tolerated by many patients who might otherwise benefit from a bone marrow transplant.</p>
<p>The new study, <a href="https://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711(19)30333-9">published October 10 in <em>Stem Cell Reports</em></a>, demonstrates an alternative regimen that mobilizes stem cells from the bone marrow in just 2 hours. It involves a single oral dose of Viagra followed two hours later by a single injection of Plerixafor.</p>
<p>"Our approach could significantly increase the number of patients who could benefit from bone marrow transplants," said Camilla Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz and senior author of the paper. "Even though there are already ways to do this, the standard regimen doesn't work for everyone."</p>
<p><strong>Translation to clinic</strong></p>
<p>Forsberg's lab conducted the study in mice, and researchers will need to conduct clinical trials in humans to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the new regimen. Both of the drugs are already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however, and they are relatively inexpensive, Forsberg said. As a result, the translation to clinical use could be much faster and less expensive than testing compounds not previously used in humans.</p>
<p>First author Stephanie Smith-Berdan, a research specialist in Forsberg's lab, said there was a lot of interest from clinical researchers when she presented preliminary findings at a meeting last year.</p>
<p>"So much clinical research is done to test new drugs, whereas we found that repurposing existing drugs that are already available and FDA-approved can potentially help patients for whom a bone marrow transplant currently isn't an option," Smith-Berdan said.</p>
<p>Patients with sickle-cell disease, for example, can't tolerate GCSF because the growth factor worsens their symptoms. But if their blood-forming stem cells could be collected safely, using alternative strategies such as Viagra plus Plerixafor, the stem cells can then be genetically modified to correct the sickle-cell mutation and returned to the patients to cure this chronic inherited disease. Gene therapy for sickle cell disease and other genetic blood disorders has shown promise in clinical trials and could prevent the life-long morbidity, high medical costs, and early mortality associated with these diseases.</p>
<p>"If we can make bone marrow transplants a super safe procedure, there are a lot of other disorders for which it could be life-changing, especially for children. Doctors could provide a one-time treatment for conditions that currently have to be managed over a patient's lifetime," Forsberg said.</p>
<p>Some bone marrow transplants use the patient's own stem cells&#8212;for example, to allow treatment with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation that can damage the bone marrow. In many cases, however, the patient needs new stem cells provided by a healthy donor. An easier method of obtaining the cells for transplants might attract more volunteer donors, Forsberg said.</p>
<p>Viagra, best known as a treatment for erectile dysfunction, is a safe and well-studied drug that promotes the widening of blood vessels (vasodilation), which increases blood flow to tissues. Initially developed as a treatment for high blood pressure, it is now used to treat a variety of vascular disorders, including pulmonary hypertension, altitude sickness, and preeclampsia.</p>
<p>Forsberg's lab decided to test Viagra's ability to help mobilize hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow after observing that vascular changes in a strain of mice they were studying led to increased stem cell mobilization. The mice lack the gene for a cell surface protein, Robo4, which the lab's previous research had shown regulates blood vessel integrity to keep the stem cells in the bone marrow.</p>
<p>Plerixafor, the other drug in the combination, is an inhibitor of Cxcr4, which is a receptor on the surface of hematopoietic stem cells that helps them stick to their niche in the bone marrow. Plerixafor mobilizes the stem cells, but is not very effective on its own.</p>
<p>"When you dilate the blood vessels with Viagra, the cells mobilized by Plerixafor are better able to get out into the blood stream," Smith-Berdan said.</p>
<p>Viagra by itself did not lead to detectable increases in hematopoietic stem cells in the blood, so patients using it for other reasons need not worry about inadvertent stem cell mobilization, the authors noted.</p>
<p>In addition to Smith-Berdan and Forsberg, the coauthors of the paper include Alyssa Bercasio, who worked on the study as a UCSC undergraduate and is now in the Global Health Program at UCSF, and UCSC postdoctoral researcher Smrithi Rajendiran. This work was funded by the American Cancer Society.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="acc40f1d80727017605850f7ed72512b"><name>power-updates</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus to resume classes, regular business with power restored</title><summary>Stay informed on any impacts from PG&amp;E's planned power outage. </summary><start-date>1570690800000</start-date><display-name>Updates on PG&amp;E's planned outage</display-name><path>/2019/10/power-updates</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/10/power-updates</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1570561593091</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1570754091366</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/10/images/campus-advisory-slug-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/10/images/campus-advisory-slug-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>campus-advisory-slug-80px.jpg</name><display-name>campus-advisory-slug-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>12615</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><h3>October 10, 2019</h3>
<div dir="auto">
<p><strong>5:33 p.m.&#8212;</strong>UC Santa Cruz will resume classes and regular business Friday now that power has been restored to its main residential campus and to its research facility at 2300 Delaware Ave.</p>
<p>Staff members are currently working to check campus safety systems as power is fully restored to the campus.</p>
<p>We encourage you to exercise care as you turn back on appliances, equipment, and other items powered by electricity.</p>
<p>Power was never lost at our Coastal Science Campus or at our Scotts Valley Center. The Silicon Valley Campus also was unaffected by Pacific Gas and Electric&#8217;s Public Safety Power Shut Off.</p>
<p>Dining Services expects all dining halls to resume regular service and hours tomorrow, though the campus will share information about any unexpected issues. Other campus services are expected to resume then, too.</p>
<p>We appreciate the patience displayed by the campus community during this uncertain and challenging time.</p>
<p>Some employees may still be experiencing power outages at their homes; managers should be flexible with employees. Employees should check with their manager or supervisor if they have specific questions or concerns about being able to make it to work due to their personal power outage circumstances.</p>
<p>Everyone in the campus community is encouraged to keep monitoring email and ucsc.edu/status for regular updates as we resume regular operations. Any urgent information will be sent via CruzAlert.</p>

The pledge will enable our researchers to expand their pioneering work, to continue unraveling evolutionary riddles, and to take aim at the genetic diseases and disorders that affect humankind.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz researchers assembled the first working draft of the human genome sequence two decades ago, then posted it online for scientists worldwide to access. That launched a new era in international biomedical study and cemented our reputation as a world leader in genomics research. This gift, to be paid in annual installments over the next decade, will enhance that reputation, and is made alongside significant new campus investment in our Genomics Institute, which is based in the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>We have committed to a one-time cash infusion of $1.7 million to cover costs associated with the institute&#8217;s relocation to 2300 Delaware Ave. Campus also has agreed to contribute $650,000 to the institute annually over the next 10 years to support its operating budget.</p>
<p>The campus and private contributions will fund not only cutting-edge medical-related research, but new scholarship involving the social sciences, arts, humanities, engineering, and physical and biological sciences. Advancements in genomic research have raised important societal questions around the nature of privacy and consent, for example, and created new ways to look at both our evolutionary past and genetic future. Our researchers are doing impactful, collaborative work on many of these fronts and I could not be more proud &#8212; or more excited about what will come next.</p>
<p>I want to thank and congratulate our colleagues in University Relations who worked closely with the donor and with institute leaders to make this gift possible possible.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ad087da680727017605850f7cda62aac"><name>brood-parasitism</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reef fish caring for their young are taken advantage of by other fish </title><summary>Biologists have reported the first evidence of brood parasitism in coral reef fish, finding unrelated young fish in groups of young being protected by their parents.</summary><keywords>Giacomo Bernardi, Bruce Lyon</keywords><start-date>1570633200000</start-date><display-name>Reef fish caring for their young are taken advantage of by other fish </display-name><path>/2019/10/brood-parasitism</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/10/brood-parasitism</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1570566077829</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1570634199671</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/altrichthys-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/altrichthys-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>altrichthys-450.jpg</name><display-name>altrichthys-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>115755</file-size><width>450</width><height>338</height></image><image-alt>Adult fish with brood</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/altrichthys-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/altrichthys-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>altrichthys-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>altrichthys-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17971</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Adult fish with brood</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><em>Altrichthys</em> species are unusual among coral reef fish for guarding their young, as seen in this photo of an adult <em>Altrichthys azurelineatus</em> with its brood.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Biologists have reported the first evidence of brood parasitism in coral reef fish, finding unrelated young fish in groups of young being protected by their parents </article-subhead><article-text><p>Scroungers and parasites seem to show up in nature wherever life produces something useful, and that includes parental care. Among birds, for example, the practice of laying eggs in other birds' nests is surprisingly common.</p>
<p>This phenomenon, known as brood parasitism, was unknown in coral reef fish because most marine fish don't provide any parental care at all. Now, however, biologists studying an unusual kind of coral reef fish that does care for its young have found that, sure enough, other fish are taking advantage of this to get free parental care for their offspring.</p>
<p>Giacomo Bernardi, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, went to the Philippines with his graduate students to study damselfish in the genus <em>Altrichthys</em>. Two species of <em>Altrichthys</em> were known to protect their young, and Bernardi's team <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/05/coral-reef-fish.html">discovered a third species</a> that also provides parental care.</p>
<p>"It is extremely rare in coral reef fish," Bernardi said. "In most species, the larvae disperse and drift with the currents before they settle onto the reef, and 99 percent of them get eaten."</p>
<p>As he was observing adult <em>Altrichthys</em> guarding their broods, Bernardi noticed that some of the young fish looked different from the others. Genetic tests revealed that the oddball fish belonged to a different species that does not provide parental care. More surpisingly, genetic testing of entire broods revealed that many <em>Altrichthys</em> parents were caring for mixed broods of young that were the same species but not offspring of the same parents.</p>
<p>"That was a complete surprise to me, and we only found it by doing the genetics," Bernardi said.</p>
<p>To help him make sense of these findings, Bernardi turned to his UCSC colleague Bruce Lyon, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology who studies brood parasitism in birds. They reported their findings in a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.15243">paper published in the journal <em>Molecular Ecology</em></a>.</p>
<p>"It's kind of a mine field in terms of how to interpret this," Lyon said. "In birds or fish, there are two main ways you can end up with mixed broods&#8212;either adoption, where young from outside the family get accepted into the brood, or brood parasitism, where an adult lays eggs in somebody else's nest."</p>
<p>Bernardi's team found evidence of both. When the young of other species show up in <em>Altrichthys</em> broods, it appears to be the result of baby fish gaining protection by integrating themselves into a brood. In mixed broods of the same species, however, the researchers often found broods composed of two genetically different families of similar sizes, making brood parasitism (laying eggs in another pair's nest) a much more likely explanation.</p>
<p>"If it's not brood parasitism, then a whole clutch of baby fish would have to swim over and get adopted. That seems unlikely because the nests are far apart, and the mortality is enormous for unprotected babies," Bernardi said.</p>
<p>The few times Bernardi collected parents for genetic sampling, the baby fish they had been guarding were eaten by predators almost immediately. "It doesn't look like the parents are aggressively defending their brood, but as soon as you remove them, predators move in within a matter of seconds. So the idea that a group of young fish would swim around and find another brood to integrate with seems very unlikely," he said.</p>
<p>Genetic testing of the eggs in <em>Altrichthys</em> nests could provide definitive evidence of brood parasitism, but Bernardi said the nests are deep in the coral, and sampling them would be too destructive. "This place is pristine and gorgeous, and we would have to break a lot of live coral to get to the nests. But it's a crucial test, so I'd like to do some experiments with <em>Altrichthys</em> in tanks," he said.</p>
<p>Fish of other species do get adopted into broods of <em>Altrichthys</em>, and Bernardi's observations suggest this may be an important survival strategy. One morning his team witnessed a large "recruitment event," when damselfish larvae that had been drifting in the currents all settled onto the reef in massive numbers.</p>
<p>"There were clouds of this one species, tens of thousands of baby fish, and over the next few days we saw the clouds get thinner and thinner as they got eaten, until eventually the only survivors were the ones that had integrated into groups of <em>Altrichthys</em>," Bernardi said. "I'm sure there were also some survivors hidden in the corals, but it suggests that adoption may play a significant role."</p>
<p>According to Lyon, parental care and brood parasitism are closely connected in the tree of life. "In most taxonomic groups that have evolved parental care, some forms of reproductive parasitism also evolve," he said. "Given the extreme rarity of parental care in reef fish, it is very interesting that these species also show forms of reproductive parasitism like adoption and brood parasitism. When organisms evolve to produce some resource, if it's cheatable, evolution will produce a cheat."</p>
<p>In addition to Bernardi and Lyon, the coauthors of the paper include first author Juliette Tariel, Angela Quiros, Kimberly Tenggardjaja, and Alexis Jackson at UC Santa Cruz, and Nicole Crane at Cabrillo College. This work was funded by the National Geographic Society and UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="adb9844c80727017605850f7b01a7ca4"><name>norris-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Norris Lecture features expert panel on saltwater intrusion October 23</title><summary>The 2019 Ken Norris Memorial Lecture on Wednesday, October 23, addresses saltwater intrusion along the Monterey Bay: Is our groundwater too salty?</summary><keywords>Andrew Fisher</keywords><start-date>1570604400000</start-date><display-name>Norris Lecture features expert panel on saltwater intrusion October 23</display-name><path>/2019/10/norris-lecture</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/10/norris-lecture</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1570577679407</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1570634067100</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lindsey Barron</name><title></title><phone/><email>lnbarron@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/poster-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/poster-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>poster-450.jpg</name><display-name>poster-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>114068</file-size><width>450</width><height>424</height></image><image-alt>event poster</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/poster-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/poster-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>poster-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>poster-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17881</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>coastal seascape</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The 2019 Ken Norris Memorial Lecture on Wednesday, October 23, addresses saltwater intrusion along the Monterey Bay: Is our groundwater too salty?</article-subhead><article-text><p>An expert panel will provide a perspective on saltwater intrusion during the annual Ken Norris Memorial Lecture at the <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> on Wednesday, October 23, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Doors open at 6 p.m. for this free public event.</p>
<p>Saltwater intrusion is a pressing problem along the Monterey Bay coastline. For years, groundwater levels in the region have been dropping to record-level lows at such a rate that the aquifers are no longer being naturally replenished by rainfall. As groundwater levels fall, salty ocean water infiltrates inland. When the aquifers become contaminated with seawater, wells become too salty and unusable.</p>
<p>Saltwater intrusion is potentially irreversible and can result in costly changes for users of groundwater. What does this mean for the future? The Seymour Center will host a lively and informative panel discussion to reveal the complexities of saltwater intrusion and explore viable solutions.</p>
<p>Moderating the discussion will be Cynthia Chase, former Santa Cruz Mayor and City Councilmember. The panelists will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ron Duncan, General Manager, Soquel Creek Water District</li>
<li>Andy Fisher, Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences, UC Santa Cruz</li>
<li>Meredith Goebel, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Stanford University</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ken Norris Memorial Lecture is named after acclaimed scientist, naturalist, teacher, and conservationist Kenneth S. Norris. Norris was a professor of natural history at UC Santa Cruz for 18 years. His legacy includes helping to found UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Long Marine Laboratory and the campus's Institute of Marine Sciences. Known for his pioneering research with dolphins and his efforts to establish the University of California&#8217;s Natural Reserve System, he was a key author of the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. The lecture is sponsored by Naomi Kirschenbaum.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>While no shutdowns are planned for main campus, our Coastal Science Campus, our research facility on Delaware Avenue, and at our Scotts Valley Center, please check your email and/or the campus website throughout the evening for additional updates.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The one UC Santa Cruz location expected to lose power is the university-managed Lick Observatory on the top of Mount Hamilton, just east of San Jose.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>PG&amp;E officials have said shutdowns will likely begin early Wednesday in the northern reaches of the state, then progress south. This is the first time PG&amp;E has done a large-scale power shutdown and the utility is not saying how long power might be out, only that it could be up to five days before all users have power restored.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A shutdown of this magnitude obviously has large ramifications for our entire campus community, even if campus does not lose power. We have thousands of students, staff, and faculty who live in the surrounding community, many of whom are also likely to be without power at their homes starting Wednesday.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Due to the dynamic nature of this situation, students, staff, and faculty also are asked to log on to the campus website, if they are able, to see if the situation has changed overnight. The campus will be providing updates about what unfolds at <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ucsc.edu/status&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1570665374685000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH8aT07BaNJzmn3va18l8L2D20DGg" href="https://ucsc.edu/status" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ucsc.edu/status</a> and on 831-459-INFO.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b117abd680727017605850f7cc8dc713"><name>info-for-employees-october-9</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Information for Employees for Wednesday, October 9, 2019</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has canceled Wednesday’s classes because of PG&amp;E’s power outage, which is expected to begin at the main campus by 5 p.m. Wednesday. </summary><start-date>1570604400000</start-date><display-name>Information for Employees for Wednesday, October 9, 2019</display-name><path>/2019/10/info-for-employees-october-9</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/10/info-for-employees-october-9</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1570634181559</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1570634181559</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>UC Santa Cruz has canceled Wednesday&#8217;s classes because of PG&amp;E&#8217;s power outage, which is expected to begin at the main campus by 5 p.m. Wednesday.

<p dir="ltr"><strong>UCPath is coming!</strong><span> In January 2020, UCPath will &#8220;go live&#8221; for our campus. Employees paid monthly will have their first UCPath payroll date on Jan. 2. Employees who are paid biweekly will have their first UCPath payroll date on Jan. 8.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>UCPath is the new human resources (HR) information system for the UC system, consolidating processing functions for payroll, benefits, budget, and related HR transactions. It also expands online self-service for employees and managers. UCPath is already implemented for more than 60% of UC employees.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Dedicated and knowledgeable teams, project managers, and campus leaders have worked behind the scenes to prepare for a smooth transition from the 35-year old Personnel Payroll System (PPS) to UCPath, and now they need your help.&#160;</span></p>

Awardees must be staff of UC Santa Cruz or dependents of staff. <br/>
<h3>Love of language</h3>
Katharina Pierini is nearing completion of a BA in Applied Linguistics and Multilingualism. She grew up in Europe, speaking multiple languages and had always loved linguistics. Pierini (Kresge &#8216;21, applied linguistics) enrolled at UC Santa Cruz in 1994 but her education was interrupted and she went on to earn an associate degree in horticulture from Cabrillo College. <br/><br/>Eventually she returned to Kresge as a groundskeeper. And this year she resumed her studies, 25 years after she first affiliated with Kresge. The scholarship is very helpful, she said.<br/><br/>&#8220;I feel like I got a huge raise,&#8221; Pierini said. &#8220;I&#8217;m very excited and feel really fortunate.&#8221;<br/><br/>She&#8217;s also grateful to her department for accommodating her schedule so she can take her classes.<br/>
<h3>Doctor of outdoors</h3>
Elizabeth Howard, director of the <a href="https://youngerlagoonreserve.ucsc.edu/">Younger Lagoon Reserve</a>, is working toward a Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology. A Kresge alumna, Howard (Ph.D. &#8216;22, ecology and evolutionary biology) earned her BA in 2001 in environmental studies and biology. <br/><br/>Her doctoral work arose from a habitat restoration project she has been supervising at the reserve. To compare outcomes, she is working in collaboration with the Coastal Commission to examine records of restoration projects statewide. Her analysis will help commission staff evaluate whether future projects are likely to meet expectations.<br/><br/>Howard hopes her degree will help her build her career options. She eventually wants to pursue roles with more decision-making authority. <br/><br/>Receiving a scholarship from the Retirees Association was especially meaningful, she said, because of the help she has received from UC Santa Cruz staff throughout her career. <br/><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;m extremely grateful, especially because this scholarship is given by retired staff,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Staff helped me get into school and to navigate once I was enrolled.&#8221;<br/><br/>When she was growing up in northwest Florida and later in the Bay Area, her parents encouraged her to spend time outdoors, and Howard has always worked outdoors. Initially she thought she might become an organic farmer. Restoration ecology is &#8220;like gardening in the natural world,&#8221; she says.<br/>
<h3>Future psychology researcher</h3>
Koa Kiefer (Crown 20&#8217;, psychology) transferred to UC Santa Cruz from Cabrillo College with a major in psychology. <br/><br/>Kiefer&#8217;s mother, Melody Litt-Louris, director of business and resource management for the Department of Student Achievement and Equity Innovation has worked for the university for 15 years. <br/><br/>&#8220;I was so excited and proud of Koa when I learned he was chosen to receive the Silver Slug scholarship,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was happy to hear Koa wanted to attend UCSC. He basically grew up living close and coming up to campus frequently.&#8221;<br/><br/>Kiefer has worked continuously to support his education. He is the first in his family to attend college. He plans to pursue a career researching cognitive neuropsychology or human-robotic interaction.<br/>
<h3>The education cost struggle</h3>
The idea for the Silver Slug award came about when Retirees Association members Mary Wells and Sharon Dirnberger were discussing their estate plans. As employees in the Admissions Office, they had both seen the challenges fellow staff faced with education expenses. <br/><br/>Together with fellow member David Kirk, they began aggressively fundraising. The Silver Slug award fund reached the $25,000 minimum to establish an endowment in time to present their first scholarship in 2018. <br/><br/>Fundraising continues. They hope to build the endowment to the point where it can make at least three $2,000 scholarships each year. In the meantime, annual fundraising continues to directly support current scholarships as well as the endowment.<br/><br/>Sally Lester, who has helped with fundraising and selecting awardees, said the award is a way to honor the ambitions of staff or their dependents who are completing or seeking an education. She noted that while some universities offer employee scholarships, UC Santa Cruz did not until the Silver Slug award was established. <br/><br/>&#8220;We figured, &#8216;OK, We&#8217;re going to do that,&#8217;&#8221; Lester said. &#8221;Staff keep the university&#8217;s engine running. It&#8217;s important to acknowledge and reward that.&#8221; <br/><br/><em>To contribute to the Silver Slug scholarship, <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=780&amp;cid=1749&amp;dids=28.834.835&amp;bledit=1">visit the online donation page</a>.</em></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b6446f4780727017605850f70184b220"><name>remaining-safe-if-power-is-lost</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Remaining safe if power is lost</title><summary>As you know, we have been informed by PG&amp;E that main campus may see its power cut tonight, part of a statewide plan by the utility to reduce the risk of wildfire in areas where high winds are forecast.</summary><start-date>1570667400000</start-date><display-name>Remaining safe if power is lost</display-name><path>/2019/10/remaining-safe-if-power-is-lost</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/10/remaining-safe-if-power-is-lost</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1570721001263</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1570721243259</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>As you know, we have been informed by PG&amp;E that main campus may see its power cut tonight, part of a statewide plan by the utility to reduce the risk of wildfire in areas where high winds are forecast.

<div></div>
<div>Together we can follow some common-sense guidelines that will help us remain safe.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Drivers should slow down, and treat all non-operating traffic signals as four-way stop signs unless a traffic-safety officer is on hand directing traffic.&#160;</li>
<li>Watch closely for bicyclists and pedestrians on both campus and city roads, especially at night, as it may be darker than usual in some areas due to reduced exterior lighting.&#160;</li>

<p>The choice wasn&#8217;t particularly difficult for Johnstone, who despite dedicating considerable toil to research in his field, has always gravitated toward the art and discipline of teaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a common trope that a lot of people work in universities because they want the freedom to research subjects of their choosing, to publish papers and secure grant funding&#8212;and then they also have to teach,&#8221; Johnstone said. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t look at it like &#8216;have to.&#8217; As a grad student, I really enjoyed working with students, teaching classes, and developing course materials.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, Johnstone has embarked on his journey as an assistant professor of chemistry at UC Santa Cruz, while placing teaching at the forefront of his professional development.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not always so with incoming or early career professors, but even those who, like Johnstone, are eager to teach are not necessarily equipped with the tools to do so effectively, particularly at an institution with an educational mission as unique and rigorous as UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have brand new early career faculty who may or may not have had professional development related to teaching,&#8221; said Jody Greene, founding director of the Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (CITL). &#8220;Even if they have received such development and taught elsewhere, they may not be familiar with evidence-based teaching and the demographic makeup at UC Santa Cruz and the associated equity gaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fostering better teachers at the college level provided impetus for the creation of the CITL three years ago. The renewed focus on teaching and learning culminated in a two-day teacher training session held in mid-September just before classes commenced. The session was well attended with 30 incoming, second-year, and third-year professors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two-day session is a new thing for our campus,&#8221; Greene said. &#8220;It&#8217;s exciting to convey to new faculty our incredible history and our passionate commitment to undergraduate teaching and how teaching is going to continue to be at the center of our institutional priorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two-day course comprehensively covered subjects incoming teachers need to know&#8212;teaching strategies to help close equity gaps; mentoring and assisting first generation students; handling cheating and plagiarism; and managing teaching assistants.</p>
<p>For Robin Dunkin, a biology instructor and CITL&#8217;s acting faculty director for fall 2019, closing the stubborn equity gaps in education represents the most pressing task for professors, new and old.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an ethical obligation to close equity gaps,&#8221; Dunkin said. &#8220;Whether it&#8217;s socioeconomic status or students from historically underrepresented populations, they graduate from college at lower rates. Our emphasis is to give faculty the tools they need so they can break the cycle of teaching the way they were taught&#8211;which we know serves all students better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of that includes a departure of the traditional lecture-style teaching into a more engaging and participatory form of education. Greene and Dunkin pointed to several studies that demonstrate that breaking up into group sessions and other forms of participatory teaching methods bolster the performance of students from both a grade and knowledge-acquisition standpoint.</p>
<p>According to Greene, while these methods have been shown to be particularly effective for first-generation students and members of historically underrepresented populations, the methods ultimately help the entire student body.</p>
<p>&#8220;The needs of first-generation students and students from marginalized groups will always be at the center of the work we do,&#8221; Greene said. &#8220;But we are imparting best practices so that all students can benefit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myriam Telus, an assistant professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences, said she appreciates acquiring strategies that will not only help students who may be unused to navigating a college environment, but will help all of those eager to learn.</p>
<p>&#8220;It helps everyone by making the classes more engaging,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Johnstone said the training helped shift his entire perspective and approach to the classroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned my focus should be on what and how I want students to learn and the tools I can use as a teacher to help that happen," he said.</p>
<p>In other words, it is less important to devise a scintillatingly brilliant and articulate lecture than it is to engage with all students to ensure they understand and develop competence with the intellectual concepts at hand.</p>
<p>Johnstone said the training also creates a community and lets other teachers know, regardless of discipline, that there are others equally invested in quality instruction.</p>
<p>Dunkin is confident the newcomers will excel.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have so much to offer the students in their exploration of the world in intellectual ways,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re just making sure they&#8217;re supported.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b6dab3b780727017605850f7a9a86da6"><name>new-faculty</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz welcomes 24 new faculty members</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is welcoming 24 new faculty members to campus this academic year.

For many participants, the goal of iGEM is not winning a prize as much as it is using science to solve real-world problems. This is certainly true of the 16 students who make up the iGEM team at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here at UCSC, a major factor in how we choose our projects is their real-world application,&#8221; said Shayan Vahdani, a molecular, cell and developmental biology major and the team co-captain.</p>
<p>Originally designed for college students, iGEM currently includes teams from high school to overgrad (defined by iGEM as individuals over the age of 23) all over the world, and is training students to become responsible scientists as they design and orchestrate projects in synthetic biology.</p>
<p>Vahdani and his team are trying to create a heat-stable vaccine for Newcastle Disease, a common and highly infectious virus that can decimate entire flocks of chickens. If successful, the team&#8217;s research could make it easier for farmers in remote locations to vaccinate their chickens against disease, empowering local communities and aiding the fight against world hunger.</p>
<p>The students are working under the guidance of David Bernick, adjunct professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering, and graduate student Ryan Modlin. Newcastle Disease has been an especially persistent issue for nonprofit organizations like Heifer International, which works with small-scale farmers in developing nations to end hunger in their communities. Chickens need to be vaccinated frequently, and current vaccines need to be refrigerated, which can make getting them to rural areas a challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having a vaccine that is temperature sensitive can be an issue for a lot of developing nations, especially where transportation is concerned,&#8221; said team member Preet Kaur, a student in biomolecular engineering.</p>
<p>The iGEM team&#8217;s goal is to create a more thermostable vaccine that can be stored at room temperature. To do this, they are using intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that come from micro-animals called tardigrades (also known as &#8220;water bears&#8221;).</p>
<p>&#8220;Tardigrades can survive temperatures of up to 150&#176;C and as low as -200&#176;C, which is attributed mostly to their intrinsically disordered proteins,&#8221; Kaur said.</p>
<p>IDPs are unique to tardigrades and form gels that stabilize other proteins. When these gels dry, they form vitrified, or glass-like, solids instead of the typical crystalline solids formed by other proteins. Scientists think these vitrified solids protect the tardigrades from extreme temperatures. The iGEM team hopes to recreate this protective structure in its vaccine, and has named itself <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:UCSC">Vitrum</a> (Latin for glass) to reflect this goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically we&#8217;re taking the proteins that originate from tardigrades and putting them in solution with our vaccine. Hopefully, the vaccine will then create a glass-like structure around the virus, protecting it and making it thermostable,&#8221; Kaur explained.</p>
<p><strong>An international collaboration</strong></p>
<p>The science is only part of the iGEM experience. The program encourages research that is connected to the community and promotes teamwork and collaboration, not just within the team itself, but also with a broader global network. As part of their project, the team reached out to Heifer International to discuss the issue of the Newcastle virus.</p>
<p>Rita Ousterhout, a student majoring in molecular, cell and developmental biology, said meeting with several directors at Heifer International was one of the most rewarding experiences of the project. &#8220;We had a Skype conversation with them, and they offered to help us out however we ask for it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was really rewarding to hear how big an issue this is for them and have that collaboration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Vitrum team has divided the work so that each student specializes in one aspect of the project, but they work together to help one another meet deadlines and accomplish their project&#8217;s goals. The team members come from a variety of backgrounds and majors, but they have managed to find common ground in their passion for scientific research.</p>
<p>&#8220;An amazing thing about iGEM is that we do a lot of great science, but we also build a family here and we get to know everyone. It&#8217;s great to have people around you who are interested in the same things and to be able to build friendships outside of science as well,&#8221; said Melody Azimi, a junior in biomolecular engineering and next year&#8217;s team captain.</p>
<p>The work is not all glamorous, however. The iGEM team is selected in February and competes in October, giving students a very short window of time for completing the project, especially considering that they have to raise all of their own funds. Several students said they have sometimes stayed in the lab until 4 a.m. to meet a deadline or find a solution to a persistent problem, and Azimi said that &#8220;a lot of things in science just don&#8217;t work out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even with the long hours and frustrating setbacks, the team members said they have found working on iGEM to be an incredibly rewarding experience. Vahdani stressed how amazing it has been working on a student-led team in which they are mostly left to figure things out for themselves. Other students agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I liked iGEM because it was the most hands-on research experience on campus, and you actually get to see an end product that could potentially be used in a real-world situation,&#8221; said Pierce.</p>
<p>Multiple members of the team said that they would encourage other students to get involved in research. &#8220;Make the most of the opportunities that UCSC offers,&#8221; Ousterhout urged. &#8220;There are so many great research labs on campus and I think that some go unnoticed because people are doing so many cool things on this campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team is still hard at work on their vaccine and will be attending the annual iGEM conference in Boston at the end of October, where they will present their project to other teams and a panel of judges.

<p>Since then, it has grown to become the largest independent literary festival on the West Coast, each year presenting a 10-day mix of hundreds of readings, interactive workshops, and cutting-edge panel discussions.</p>
<p>This year, in honor of its 20th anniversary, Litquake has created 20 new events in 20 cities across the country outside of San Francisco. One of those events will take place at Bookshop Santa Cruz on October 15, co-presented by The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Titled<strong> &#8220;<em>Funny &amp; Peculiar: Santa Cruz Writers on Keeping it Weird,&#8221;</em> </strong>the LItquake Santa Cruz evening will be hosted by local authors Dan White and Amy Ettinger. White is the author of <em>The Cactus Eaters: How I Lost My Mind and Almost Found Myself on the Pacific Crest Trail </em>and <em>Under The Stars: How America Fell In Love With Camping.</em></p>
<p>Ettinger, a UCSC alumna (Merrill '95), is the author of <em>Sweet Spot: An Ice Cream Binge Across America</em>, and teaches writing at Stanford Continuing Studies.</p>
<p>Together they will moderate a panel of notable Santa Cruz writers that include Elizabeth&#160;McKenzie, Micah Perks, Peggy Townsend, Liza Monroy and Wallace Baine.</p>
<p>&#8220;The theme for the event is 'funny and peculiar,'" said White. &#8220;The general idea is: it&#8217;s 2019 and things could not get any stranger, so why not mine the oddities of life with these five distinguished local writers? Each of these writers has a joyfully off-kilter way of looking at the world. Their work will give the audience members a taste of the quirky side of life."</p>
<p>"This is the first-ever Litquake event in Santa Cruz,&#8221; White added. &#8220;It's great for our writing community, and it sends a positive message. We've had a thriving literary scene for a long time, but our writing scene doesn't get the same exposure as the larger writing hubs like LA and San Francisco. We have so many creative and talented people doing great work here. I think of our writing scene as one of those 'best kept secrets.'"</p>
<p>Ettinger observed that it makes sense that Litquake would expand to include local writers because Santa Cruz has such a rich and vibrant literary community.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that each year the literary community grows, bolstered by the wonderful events that are hosted by Bookshop Santa Cruz,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When I was a student at UC Santa Cruz in the 1990s, I remember spending time at the bookshop, hearing authors speak, browsing the shelves, and jotting down the ideas for stories, which I later finished writing across the street at Lulu Carpenter's. These were stories I workshopped at creative writing classes at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I'm proud to be joining the other writers on our panel in representing UCSC and also celebrating the wonderfully weird and sometimes peculiar Santa Cruz writing world,"&#160;Ettinger added.</p>

This novel readout technology could enable scientists to study how neural circuits function at an unprecedented scale by monitoring large numbers of individual neurons simultaneously. It could also lead to high-bandwidth brain-machine interfaces with dramatically enhanced precision and functionality.</p>
<p>Monitoring the electrical activity of neurons is conventionally done using microelectrode arrays, but these are difficult to implement at a large scale and offer limited spatial resolution. In addition, the electronic wiring required for readout is a major limitation of microelectrodes, according to Ali Yanik, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>"The extremely limited bandwidth of the electronic wiring is a bottleneck created by the very nature of electrons," Yanik said. "We turn to photons because light offers billion-fold enhanced multiplexing and information carrying capabilities, the same reason why the telecommunication industry moved to fiber optics. By converting bioelectric signals to photons, we will be able to transmit large-bandwidth neural activity optically."</p>
<p>Yanik's lab, working with collaborators at the University of Notre Dame, has developed extracellular nanoprobes that enable ultrasensitive optical monitoring of electrophysiological signals. Other optical monitoring techniques require genetic modifications to insert fluorescent molecules into cell membranes, which rules out their use in humans.</p>
<p>Yanik's approach is similar to extracellular microelectrode techniques, except that the readout mechanism is optical and the probes have nanoscale dimensions. In addition, it yields a much brighter signal and higher signal-to-noise ratios than fluorescence-based probes.</p>
<p>"Harnessing the unparalleled multiplexing and information-carrying capability of light to dissect the neural circuitry and decrypt electrophysiological signals has been a goal of neuroscientists for nearly 50 years. We may have finally found a way to do that," Yanik said.</p>
<p>The new technology is described in a paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aav9786">published October 18 in <em>Science Advances</em></a>. Ahsan Habib, a Ph.D. candidate in Yanik's lab, is first author of the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Broad applications</strong></p>
<p>Although the technology is still in the early stages of development, Yanik said it could open the door to a wide range of applications. Ultimately, he said, it may lead to powerful brain-machine interfaces, enabling the development of new brain-controlled prosthetic technologies for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Yanik's optical nanoprobes are nanoscale devices (less than 100 nanometers in diameter) based on a novel metallic antenna structure coupled to a biocompatible polymer called PEDOT. This polymer is "electro-chromic," meaning its optical properties change in response to the local electric field. The antenna is a "plasmonic nanoantenna," meaning it uses nanoscale interactions of light and matter in a way analogous to a radio antenna. The result is an "electro-plasmonic nanoantenna" that provides reliable optical detection of local electric field dynamics with remarkably high sensitivity.</p>
<p>"The electro-plasmonic nanoantenna has a resonance frequency that changes in response to the electric field, and we can see that when we shine light on it, so we can read the signal remotely," Yanik explained.</p>
<p>The researchers performed a series of laboratory experiments to characterize and optimize the properties of the electro-plasmonic nanoantenna. They then tested its ability to monitor electrophysiological signals in cell cultures of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells which, like neurons, can generate electrical impulses). The results demonstrated real-time, all-optical detection of electrical activity in cardiomyocytes, with high signal-to-noise ratios.</p>
<p>Aside from not requiring genetic manipulations, the advantages of this technique over fluorescent probes include the very low light intensities needed, two to three orders of magnitude lower than the typical light intensities used for fluorescent voltage probes. In addition, the fluorescent molecules are susceptible to bleaching and generate disruptive oxygen free radicals.</p>
<p>Yanik described two possible approaches for using the optical nanoprobes to monitor neural activity in living animals, including humans. The probes could be integrated with an optical fiber into a flexible and biocompatible implant, or they could be synthesized as nanoparticles suspended in a colloidal solution, with surface proteins attached to enable the probes to bind to specific cell types.</p>
<p>"With the solution-based system, you could inject it into the bloodstream or into an organ, and the nanoprobes attach to the specific cell types you want to monitor," Yanik said. "We are just at the beginning stages of this, but I think we have a good foundation to build on."</p>
<p>An important consideration for using neural probes in living animals is the inherent immune response to foreign materials in the body. Previous studies have shown that coating electrodes with the biocompatible PEDOT polymer dramatically improves the long-term performance of microfabricated neural prosthetic devices. The size of implants also influences the immune response.</p>
<p>"The critical feature sizes are 10 to 15 microns. Recent studies have shown that smaller size implants lead to dramatically reduced inherent immune response," Habib said. "In this sense, our PEDOT-coated probes with nanoscale dimensions are particularly advantageous for long-term operation."</p>
<p>In addition to Habib and Yanik, the coauthors of the paper include UCSC graduate students Xiangchao Zhu and Maverick McLanahan, and Uryan Can and Pinar Zorlutuna at the University of Notre Dame.

<p>The UC Santa Cruz Campus Sustainability Plan (CSP) Fellows program serves as a student employment funding mechanism to support departments in their implementation of projects and programs that forward the goals, strategies, and actions identified in the 2017&#8211;22 Campus Sustainability Plan. Learn more <a href="https://sustainabilityplan.ucsc.edu/implementation/funding/">online</a>.</p>
<p>The CSP Fellows program provides award funding for departments to hire an undergraduate student. Fellowship awards are for up to 10 hours/week at minimum wage for late fall through spring quarters, plus $500 for project implementation. Unit projects will be funded based on how well they align with the implementation of <a href="https://sustainabilityplan.ucsc.edu/campus-sustainability-plan/">specific Campus Sustainability Plan</a> actions. If funded, responsibility for recruitment, hiring and supervision of the Fellow rests on the unit hosting the project. Quarterly training opportunities will be offered for supervisors and mentors from all units by the Sustainability Office.</p>

<h3>Carbon Fund - Student Fee Measure 44 grants</h3>
<p>The Carbon Fund is a student-fee funded measure that awards about $100,000 annually to projects that help to reduce our campus carbon footprint. Projects in the past have included lab equipment upgrades, paper towel removals, emission free transportation, and many more. Our voting committee, consisting of all levels of campus life, reviews applications based on how well they fit the five key criteria, primarily weighted toward the project&#8217;s feasibility and longevity, and the reductions in CO2 and resource use. Detailed criteria are listed on the application.</p>

Anyone who wants to support those shaving or sign up to go bald themselves can do so at <span><a href="http://www.stbaldricks.org/events/UCSC2019">www.stbaldricks.org/events/UCSC2019</a></span>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fantastic way to show your support for kids undergoing treatment for childhood cancer,&#8221; said organizer Katrina Learned, a UCSC Treehouse staff member who has shaved in honor of her daughter Aurora. Aurora, a childhood cancer survivor, was also one of the inspirations for founding the Genomics Institute&#8217;s Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative.<br/> <br/> Will UC Santa Cruz be able to recapture its crown? The campus won its first Battle of the Bald St. Baldrick's competition back in 2016, when 28 people shaved their heads and raised $29,488 (see <span><a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/blog/post/the-2016-battle-of-the-bald-champion">St. Baldrick&#8217;s blog post</a></span>).</p>
<p>Every two minutes a child is diagnosed with cancer; one in five won&#8217;t survive, and those who do often suffer long-term effects from treatments. Donations raised at events like this have made it possible for St. Baldrick&#8217;s to fund more than $200 million to support the development of childhood cancer treatments that are as unique as every kid. Some of this is invested in projects St. Baldrick&#8217;s Foundation funds at UCSC's Treehouse Initiative in its efforts to combat childhood cancer. Treehouse projects include a tumor database of more than 11,000 samples available for use by all researchers in the pediatric cancer community and beyond.</p>
<p>The mission of the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative is to change the story for childhood cancer patients by employing genomic data and computational approaches that could identify less toxic and more effective treatments. Treehouse analyzes a child&#8217;s cancer data against both childhood and adult patient cohorts across all types of cancer. This &#8220;pan-cancer&#8221; analysis of adult and pediatric tumors may identify situations where an adult drug is predicted to work on a subset of pediatric patients.

Santa Cruz alumnus <strong>Lawrence Weschler</strong> will join <em>Radiolab</em>&#8217;s <strong>Robert Krulwich</strong> for a public conversation about the late neurologist and acclaimed author&#160;<strong>Oliver Sacks</strong> on October 21, at 7 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall.</p>
<p>The two journalists will reflect on the life and work of their longtime mutual friend, who is the subject of Weschler&#8217;s new book, a biographical memoir titled <em>And How Are You, Dr Sacks</em>? that was just published in August.</p>
<p>A best-selling author, and a professor of neurology at the NYU School of Medicine, Sacks has been described by the <em>The New York Times&#160;</em>as &#8220;the poet laureate of medicine.&#8221; His 1973 book, <em>Awakenings</em>, inspired the 1990 Academy Award-nominated film starring Robert De Niro and Robin Williams.</p>
<p>Sacks was a frequent contributor to the&#160;<em>New Yorker</em>&#160;and the&#160;<em>New York Review of Books</em>, and is well known for his collections of neurological case histories that include <em>The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat</em>,&#160;<em>Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain</em>, and <em>An Anthropologist on Mars</em>.&#160;His patients&#8217; disorders were the catalyst for unconventional and insightful observations on the human condition.</p>
<p>Weschler first began spending time with Sacks in the early 1980s when he set out to profile the neurologist for <em>The New Yorker</em>. Over the next four years, they worked closely together until, for personal reasons, Sacks asked Weschler to abandon the profile. The two remained friends for the next three decades, and as Sacks was dying, he asked Weschler to take up the project again. Weschler&#8217;s latest book captures the essence of their close friendship.</p>
<p>A graduate of Cowell College&#160; (1974, Philosophy and Western Civilization), Weschler was a staff writer at the <em>New Yorker</em> for more than 20 years and is director emeritus of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. He is the author of more than 20 books, including <em>Vermeer in Bosnia</em> and <em>Mr. Wilson&#8217;s Cabinet of Wonder</em>.</p>
<p>Robert Krulwich is a science correspondent for NPR and co-host of the Peabody Award-winning program, <em>Radiolab</em>. He won an Emmy Award for his investigative work on privacy and the Internet, as well as for his ABC television special on the cultural history of Barbie. Over the past three decades, Krulwich has had the opportunity to speak with Sacks about everything from music to neurology to hallucinations.</p>
<p><strong>Weschler initiated the UCSC visit </strong>to coincide with his West Coast book tour, contacting Cowell College provost Alan Christy to set up the event. He has kept in touch with his former teachers at the college over the years, including philosophy professor Robert Goff--who has noted that it was due to Weschler&#8217;s influence in 1985 that Oliver Sacks accepted a position as a Regents&#8217; Professor at Cowell. Sacks&#8217; first book, <em>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</em>, had just been published, and he taught a seminar about it at UCSC.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Weschler also returned to the campus as a Regent&#8217;s lecturer, offering an abbreviated course through Cowell College on how to read a newspaper.</p>
<p>Recent visits by Weschler to the campus include a Cowell event in 2017 titled "Waves Passing in the Night: Astrophysics, Harmony, and Boundaries,&#8221; where he was on a panel with Academy Award-winning sound and film editor Walter Murch and campus astronomer Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz; and "Music of The Waves" in 2014, where he spoke at the Cowell library with his <em>New Yorker</em> colleague and fellow UCSC alumnus, William Finnegan.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great to welcome back a devoted alum who keeps us ever in mind and whose work he consistently represents as, at least in part, being made possible by the education he received here,&#8221; said Christy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The students in the Cowell Core course are reading one of his essays this quarter from his book, <em>Vermeer in Bosnia</em>,&#8221; he added.</p>

Wildlife biologist Chris Wilmers rigged up a video camera to spy on the carcass at night. But the animal that crept out of the shadows to dine on the deer was no coyote&#8212;it was a mountain lion.</p>
<p>Mountain lions, or pumas, stay close to their prey, &#8220;so it must have been hiding in a nearby gorge all day,&#8221; said Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.</p>
<p>The persistent puma was already well-known by Wilmers, a professor of environmental studies at UCSC who had radio-collared and tagged the animal, dubbed 36m, as part of a long-term study of California mountain lions. Now 36m is becoming even more famous as the first puma to have its complete genome deciphered by scientists.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12741-1">paper published October 18 in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em></a>, Shapiro, Wilmers, and their colleagues reported that the information in 36m&#8217;s genes may lead to better conservation strategies.</p>
<p>Many puma populations across North America are becoming increasingly isolated, Wilmers said. That ups their chances of succumbing to inbreeding and its consequences, which include serious abnormalities such as damaged hearts and malformed sperm. With whole genomic information, however, scientists can pinpoint populations that need an influx of new genes or identify the best pumas to move between populations.</p>
<p>According to Shapiro, such work could stop inbreeding in its tracks and help keep local populations from going extinct. &#8220;This is the first time that whole genomes have been used in this way,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><strong>Pumas in peril</strong></p>
<p>The team&#8217;s new sequencing work is not the first effort to unlock pumas&#8217; genetic secrets. Years of painstaking research by geneticist Stephen O&#8217;Brien, molecular ecologist Warren Johnson, and others had previously shown that Florida&#8217;s tiny population of pumas (also known as cougars or panthers) had become dangerously inbred, resulting in health defects like holes in their hearts and missing testicles. These abnormalities threatened the animals&#8217; ability to reproduce.</p>
<p>The research team also proved that the introduction of eight female cougars from west Texas in 1995 had added enough new genes to boost health and help the population grow from about <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=20929847">30 individuals to more than 120</a>. But the team&#8217;s effort was limited by the genetic technology available at the time, which relied on analyzing just small snapshots of DNA, or markers, scattered throughout the genome. So the scientists didn&#8217;t have a complete picture of the pumas&#8217; genes.</p>
<p>Animals get two versions of every gene &#8211; one from mom and, usually, a different one from dad. This means that offspring have the genetic diversity needed to keep populations healthy. But when populations become small and isolated, relatives breed with each other. As a result, genetic diversity plunges, and many genome locations end up with two identical versions of a gene. That&#8217;s when weird things happen to animals, like the kinked tails, damaged hearts, and malformed sperm found in the inbred Florida panthers before the infusion of Texas cougar genes.</p>
<p>Using DNA markers alone, scientists can estimate the average amount of genetic variation within a population and get a rough picture of the level of inbreeding. But this approach can&#8217;t say whether major stretches of DNA between those markers contain copies of genes that are the same. These runs of identical gene copies are crucial, said Johnson, who is at the Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit and affiliated with the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute&#8217;s Center for Species Survival.</p>
<p>The number and length of these stretches provide a precise measure of both the extent of inbreeding and how recent it is&#8212;and, therefore, how close a population is to falling off a genetic cliff. Inbreeding is not a slow and progressive process, Shapiro explained. Instead, she said, once enough long runs of DNA with identical copies accumulate, the effects of inbreeding kick in suddenly, like turning off a light switch.</p>
<p><strong>From mammoths to mountain lions</strong></p>
<p>Shapiro is best known for recovering and sequencing tiny bits of DNA from ancient bones, charting the genetic changes in mammoths and other now-extinct animals as their numbers shrank. But she also has a keen interest in applying the same techniques to existing creatures, like the North American mountain lion. She wants to learn more about the genetic roads to extinction and possibly prevent today's creatures from suffering the same fate as the mammoths. Shapiro and Wilmers were talking one day about the Santa Cruz lion population when they realized that a crucial piece of information was missing: the puma&#8217;s complete genetic sequence.</p>
<p>Using blood that Wilmers had already collected from puma 36m, Shapiro and her team, including UCSC graduate student Nedda Saremi and postdoc Megan Supple (co-first authors of the paper), sequenced the lion&#8217;s entire genome to serve as a reference for the species. Then, for comparison, they sequenced the genomes of nine other mountain lions using stored samples &#8211; another from the Santa Cruz area, two from the Santa Monica mountains, one from Yellowstone, three from Florida, and one from Brazil.</p>
<p>The work let Shapiro see what had taken years to figure out in Florida&#8212;that the translocation of Texas cougars had boosted genetic diversity and health of the Florida panthers. The sequences also brought new insights: even after mixing in the Texas DNA, the Florida population remains closer to the genetic brink than previously thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big takeaway is that translocation worked, but the lights are going to go off because they continue to inbreed,&#8221; Shapiro said.</p>
<p>Similarly, the population in the Santa Cruz Mountains &#8220;is not doing as well as we expected,&#8221; she said. The 10 genomes also held controversial hints that mountain lions may have existed in North America far longer than previously thought&#8212;as long as 300,000 years, instead of fewer than 20,000 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Beth and her students are able to learn from just 10 individuals greatly extends what could be inferred with traditionally used DNA markers,&#8221; Johnson said.</p>
<p>More insights will come as scientists ramp up whole genome sequencing. Sequencing the full genomes of many individuals across a species&#8217; range is &#8220;tremendously valuable,&#8221; explains Brad Shaffer, director of the UCLA La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science. &#8220;That can tell us a lot about the potential for climate adaptation and other critical conservation goals,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>And with costs rapidly declining&#8212;Shapiro says reading 36m&#8217;s genome cost about $10,000, down from $30,000 a couple of years ago, with subsequent lions sequenced for just $400 each&#8212;O&#8217;Brien and others are pushing for a much larger effort. &#8220;Whole genome sequencing should be done for every critter we can catch,&#8221; says O&#8217;Brien, of Nova Southeastern University.</p>
<p>Already, Shapiro&#8217;s work is shining a powerful new spotlight on the genetic health of individual mountain lions and populations, pointing the way to more effective conservation strategies. Isolated populations, for example, may benefit from wildlife bridges across major highways, to allow animals to wander more widely. In other cases, scientists may need to move animals from one region to another. Overall, a more complete picture of the genome makes it possible to spot populations at greatest risk for inbreeding&#8212;and the best candidates for translocation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we can make more informed decisions,&#8221; said Johnson. &#8220;In the past, we made decisions based on limited genetic information.&#8221; The new approach takes out much of the uncertainty about a population&#8217;s genetic heritage, he said. It also offers clues about how to preserve genetic variation and may help populations adapt to change.</p>
<p>Though puma 36m didn&#8217;t live to see any of these advances, his genetic legacy will remain. &#8220;While 36m was a badass puma by any measure, he might one day come to be the most recognized puma anywhere,&#8221; Wilmers wrote in a <a href="http://www.santacruzpumas.org/2015/10/rip-36m-genomics-godfather-to-all-pumas/">tribute</a>.&#8220;[His] will be the puma genome against which other puma genomes can be compared and used to test all sorts of evolutionary and ecological questions.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.santacruzpumas.org/</url><title>Santa Cruz Puma Project</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dfb1263a80727017605850f7368a4739"><name>abusive-conduct</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2019 Abusive Conduct Reaffirmation</title><summary>We are writing to reaffirm that everyone in the UC Santa Cruz community is entitled to work in an atmosphere free from bullying and abusive conduct.</summary><start-date>1571382000000</start-date><display-name>Abusive Conduct Reaffirmation</display-name><path>/2019/10/abusive-conduct</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/10/abusive-conduct</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1571415991823</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1571418645556</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>We are writing to reaffirm that everyone in the UC Santa Cruz community is entitled to work in an atmosphere free from bullying and abusive conduct.

<p><em>Run</em><span>&#160;</span><em>With</em><span>&#160;</span><em>It </em><em>i</em>s one of 12 films selected this year to receive journalistic doc grants from the IDA. The Enterprise Documentary Fund, launched in 2017, supports feature-length documentary films telling &#8220;urgent, revelatory stories underpinned by rigorous journalistic approaches and exemplary artistic achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The awards were announced at the Double Exposure Investigative Film Festival in Washington, D.C. The 12 film projects will receive a total of $850,000 in direct funding, along with additional resources and expertise through IDA and its partners: Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, the UCLA Documentary Film Legal Clinic, and Freelance Investigative Reporters and Editors.</p>
<p>&#8220;These films, which were selected through an extensive review process, examine their subjects with a depth and artistry that is truly remarkable,&#8221; said Carrie Lozano, director of the IDA Enterprise Documentary Fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;While they are crafting radically different stories, what they share in common are sophisticated and nuanced approaches that are as insightful as they are gripping, provoking audiences to contemplate the contradictions and complexities of the modern world.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Run with It</em><span>&#160;</span>tells the story of De'Jaun, a young black man on the Dean's List at Morehouse College, who grew up spinning quarters on death row with his uncle, Troy Davis. He also attended Amnesty International protests with his mother, Martina, who fought for 20 years to prove her brother Troy&#8217;s innocence.&#160;At 19, Troy&#160;was accused of killing a white police officer in one of the most controversial, racially charged cases to go before the courts.</p>
<p>The multigenerational story is both a legal investigation into Troy&#8217;s case and an intimate look at the impacts of a death sentence on his family and the whole community.</p>
<p><strong>Hibbert-Jones creates</strong><span><strong>&#160;</strong></span>documentary films with Talisman that explore the crisis in the criminal justice system and the U.S. racial divide, blending animation, documentation, and the aesthetics of the graphic novel.&#160;</p>
<p>Their most recent animated documentary short,<span>&#160;</span><em>Last Day of Freedom</em>, was nominated for an Academy Award for &#8220;Best Documentary Short&#8221; in 2016. It also received the International Documentary Association &#8220;Best Short&#8221; award, as well as a regional Emmy. The film additionally screened at 30 international festivals, and won 12 festival awards.</p>
<p>Hibbert-Jones teaches sculpture, public art and digital art new media at UC Santa Cruz, and advises in film and social documentary.&#160;Her short film, installations, and new media projects have been exhibited worldwide in exhibitions, museums and festivals.</p>
<p>In 2016, she was honored with a<span>&#160;</span><em>United States Congressional Black Caucus Veterans Braintrust Award</em>&#160;in recognition for&#160;her&#160;outstanding national commitment to&#160;civil rights, and social justice.</p>

<p><span>An inherited disease that leads to blindness, retinitis pigmentosa can be caused by mutations in the gene for rhodopsin, a light-sensitive protein found in the retina of the eye. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Kliger's lab has been studying rhodopsin for the past 40 years. With the recent funding, part of a larger grant awarded to Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU), Kliger will investigate how the mutated, or abnormal, rhodopsin protein behaves differently from the normal protein. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Kliger first became interested in retinitis pigmentosa when a colleague's wife began to experience early symptoms associated with the disease. "It's a gradual degenerative change," he said, noting that those affected by mutations in the rhodopsin gene lose their eyesight gradually as cells die off in the retina, the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Motivated by a personal tie to the disease and determined to be a part of the effort to find a solution, Kliger set out on a multi-decade journey. At the time, little was known about how the mutations change the functioning of the rhodopsin protein. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Rhodopsin is found in the retina's rod cells, which are responsible for vision in low-light conditions. Rods and cones, the other type of light-sensing cells in the retina, convert light into electrical signals that get sent to the brain by the optic nerve. Rhodopsin plays a crucial role in this process. When light enters the eye and hits the rhodopsin, it causes small movements within the protein's structure that set off a cascade of reactions leading to an electrical impulse that eventually registers as sight. </span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Retinitis pigmentosa</strong></p>
<p><span>In retinitis pigmentosa, mutations in the gene for rhodopsin result in an abnormal version of the protein that doesn't work correctly and eventually causes the rod cells to die. Over time, the loss of the rod cells causes cone cells to die as well, resulting in blindness. Different mutations in the rhodopsin gene are associated with different rates of progression and age of onset of the disease.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>In order for Kliger and his team to understand the abnormal rhodopsin, they first needed to understand the functioning of healthy rhodopsin as it responds to light at near-physiological temperatures. Prior research on this process had been done at low temperatures to slow down the protein's movements. Kliger and his team set out to document the steps rhodopsin goes through at room temperature. The sophisticated equipment and technology needed for this work didn't exist yet, so they built their own. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>"It's hard to imagine how much work it was to get to this point," Kliger explained. "We were having to solve one problem that then led to another problem, which led to another." </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>After decades of research, Kilger and his team have pioneered a new way to "see" rhodopsin and how it changes shape as it interacts with light. The technique they use&#8212;nanosecond time-resolved spectroscopy&#8212;enables them to deconstruct the steps in the process by analyzing the changes in the color of light that is absorbed as it passes through the rapidly morphing proteins. This work has enabled Kliger's team to uncover several previously unknown steps in the functioning of rhodopsin.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Finally equipped with a roadmap of how healthy rhodopsin behaves when exposed to light, Kliger can now begin to investigate what goes wrong in retinitis pigmentosa. "Now we're in a position to ask what exactly happens when you have a mutation in the protein that causes a disease," he said.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Under the new NIH grant, Kliger's team will be collaborating with a team led by David Farrens at OHSU. Their goal is to analyze abnormal rhodopsin in the same way they did with the healthy proteins and compare the results. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>"We want to look at the mechanism and figure out where it stops working," Kliger said, adding that he is hopeful this work will enable the development of targeted therapies for treating retinitis pigmentosa. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Although the woman who initially inspired Kliger and his team to embark on this journey has now essentially lost her eyesight, he remains dedicated to the cause. "Without knowing what is happening, it's hard to know what we'll have to do to overcome it," he said, "but we're as close as we've ever been."</span><span></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="efd6732680727017605850f7bee4583a"><name>kamimoto-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Associate admissions director earns award for outstanding service</title><summary>David Kamimoto was recognized last month by the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC) for his long-standing commitment to ethical practices and standards, and service to the organization. &#13;

<p>&#160;</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Inequities by race and class are problematic—but fixable, says author</article-subhead><article-text><p>Recess is a lot like school lunch: Some kids get lasagna with an organic green salad, some get a burrito out of a box, and some do without. Like lunch, who gets recess&#8212;and who gets <em>good </em>recess&#8212;is often determined by what school district a student lives in.</p>
<p>Inequity doesn't have to be baked into recess&#8212;or lunch.</p>
<p>"Recess is an essential but often neglected part of the school day," said Rebecca London, author of the new book <em>Rethinking Recess: Creating Safe and Inclusive Playtime for All Children in School</em>. "Every child needs recess, but recess is not distributed equitably."</p>
<p>Students of color, low-income students, and students in urban areas are less likely to get recess at all, or they get less recess, said London, assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Withholding recess is the most common discipline meted out in elementary school, according to London. "It's so common, people don't even think about it," she said.</p>
<p>But that practice flies in the face of evidence that recess attends to all the developmental needs of a child, offering opportunities for physical activity, the development of social and emotional skills like collaboration and empathy, and enhanced potential for academic success.</p>
<p>"When recess is built around principles of safety and inclusion, students learn to self-regulate their emotions and resolve conflicts that arise during the course of play," she said. "When a child loses a game on the playground, they learn about anger management and working together with peers&#8212;and adults. Kids can practice these skills in real time. Recess is an unregulated space. It's not like the classroom."</p>
<p>Moreover, recess gives students the opportunity to demonstrate respect and empathy for others and to establish positive relationships with peers and adults.</p>
<p>"A well-administered recess is the best anti-bullying program there is," said London. "It shouldn't be an afterthought to what happens inside the classroom. Recess improves school climate and helps students build valuable life skills. Even school districts with budget and space constraints can do a good job with recess."</p>
<p>By contrast, recess that is neglected or poorly planned can be a major source of disciplinary incidents and office referrals. "When children spend their recess time arguing rather than playing, or bored rather than engaged, the time is wasted," she said. "Worse, it can be detrimental to a child's healthy development."</p>
<p>For students who repeatedly "get in trouble" or are behind on their school work, repeated withholding of recess can contribute to feelings that they are "different," or "don't belong" in school, said London. "It's a stepladder on the school-to-prison pipeline." The students most likely to be disciplined in elementary school are boys of color, especially African American and Latinx boys, and special education students, according to Office of Civil Rights statistics London reviewed.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, schools in large swaths of the country began cutting back and even eliminating recess as part of a focus on standards-based accountability that also prompted cuts to art and music programs, said London. Some large urban school districts that serve low-income populations and students of color did away with recess entirely; new schools in some cities were even built without outdoor play areas.</p>
<p>Most districts have reinstated recess, but disparities in access and quality persist.</p>
<p>For recess to be successful, London says every school should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A plan for a healthy and inclusive recess that embeds school and community values and assets;</li>
<li>Appropriate spaces and equipment that support student engagement;</li>
<li>Professional development for adults who monitor recess to support a positive and inclusive environment;</li>
<li>Opportunities for student leadership in planning and even executing a safe and healthy recess time.</li>
</ul>
<p>"A little preparation and training can go a long way," said London.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f42df76180727017605850f79f6381d4"><name>science-communication-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Boosting diversity, inclusion, and representation in science journalism</title><summary>Science Communication Master's Program empowers the next generation of science journalists with support from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</summary><keywords>Erika Hayden</keywords><start-date>1571929200000</start-date><display-name>Boosting diversity, inclusion, and representation in science journalism</display-name><path>/2019/10/science-communication-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/10/science-communication-grant</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1571759716160</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1571930127139</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Science Communication Program</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/hayden-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/hayden-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hayden-400.jpg</name><display-name>hayden-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>103337</file-size><width>400</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>Erika Check Hayden</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/hayden-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/hayden-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hayden-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>hayden-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22270</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Erika Check Hayden</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Erika Check Hayden</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Science Communication Master's Program empowers the next generation of science journalists with support from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has received a grant of $195,500 from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) to increase diversity, inclusion, and representation in its science journalism program. The grant will support efforts to attract a diverse set of candidates to UCSC's <a href="https://scicom.ucsc.edu">Science Communication Master&#8217;s Program</a>, the only graduate science writing program in the United States that requires a degree in science and experience in research.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nasw.org/system/files/articles/SWFall2018_ExcerptPgs678.pdf">2018 survey</a> of the National Association of Science Writers&#8212;the field&#8217;s largest professional organization&#8212;found that more than 88 percent of its membership identified as white, 5 percent as Asian or Pacific Islander, 3 percent as Latino or Hispanic, approximately 2 percent as South Asian, and a similar percentage chose multiple identifications. Only 1 percent identified as Black or African American.</p>
<p>&#8220;Representation is a major issue in science journalism, which influences what stories are told and contributes to an inaccurate public narrative of who belongs in science,&#8221; said Erika Check Hayden, director of the UCSC Science Communication Master&#8217;s Program. &#8220;As we expand the workforce of this field, I&#8217;ve seen that the next generation of science journalists wants to offer a more inclusive and accurate vision of what science is, who does it, and how it impacts people&#8217;s lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>CZI&#8217;s two-year grant supports UC Santa Cruz to recruit diverse candidates, develop new training in innovative storytelling techniques such as podcasting, and identify internships for students at local and regional outlets around the country to focus on community-centered reporting. The grant will also support the diversification of science communication faculty and guest instructors, as well as fund tuition and living expenses for scholars to enroll in the nine-month curriculum. UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s program aims to establish a model for expanding the representation in science journalism that could be replicated at other training programs worldwide.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to support UC Santa Cruz in diversifying science journalism,&#8221; said Jeff MacGregor, director of science communications at CZI. &#8220;Supporting diverse researchers to write about science in communities around the country will strengthen the quality and variety of stories told about the important work that science contributes to society.&#8221;</p>
<p>An additional outcome of the support for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s program is supporting a new communication class for students enrolled in science and engineering graduate programs at the school, aimed at boosting the engagement of scientists in public communication.</p>
<p>Established in 1981, the UC Santa Cruz program produces a range of professional science writers, with over 350 alumni working at the nation&#8217;s leading media outlets such as the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>New York Times</em>, PBS NewsHour, and <em>Washington Post</em>. The program accepts 10 students each year and focuses on practical training through rigorous coursework and diverse internships. In 2018, the program was approved as a Master&#8217;s program.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://undark.org/2019/10/24/more-inclusive-science-journalism-is-better-science-journalism/</url><title>Opinion: More Inclusive Science Journalism Is Better Science Journalism </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f473f03180727017605850f7790be1d0"><name>deer-alert-rutting-season</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Deer Alert - Rutting Season</title><summary>This time of year drivers and cyclists need to be extra vigilant about deer darting into roadways.

A similar event in our own solar system may have formed the moon.</p>
<p>In a study led by Maggie Thompson, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, astronomers followed up earlier observations of the double-star system known as BD +20 307. More than 300 light years from Earth, with stars that are at least one billion years old, this mature system has shown signs of swirling dusty debris that is not cold, as would be expected around stars of this age. Rather, the debris is warm, reinforcing that it was made relatively recently by the impact of two planet-sized bodies.</p>
<p>A decade ago, observations of this system by ground observatories and NASA&#8217;s Spitzer Space Telescope gave the first hints of this collision when the warm debris was first found. New observations with the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) revealed the infrared brightness from the debris has increased by more than 10 percent, a sign that there is now even more warm dust.</p>
<p>Published in the <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab0d7f">Astrophysical Journal</a></em>, the results further support that an extreme collision between rocky exoplanets may have occurred relatively recently. Collisions like these can change planetary systems. It is believed that a collision between a Mars-sized body and the Earth 4.5 billion years ago created debris that eventually formed the moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;The warm dust around BD +20 307 gives us a glimpse into what catastrophic impacts between rocky exoplanets might be like,&#8221; said Thompson, the lead author of the paper. &#8220;We want to know how this system subsequently evolves after the extreme impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Planets form when dust particles around a young star stick together and grow larger over time. The leftover debris remains after a planetary system forms, often in distant, cold regions like the Kuiper Belt, located beyond Neptune in our own solar system.</p>
<p>Astronomers expect to find warm dust around young solar systems. As they evolve, the dust particles continue to collide and eventually become small enough that they are either blown out of a system or pulled into the star. Warm dust around older stars, like our sun and the two stars in BD +20 307, should have long since disappeared. Studying the dusty debris around stars not only helps astronomers learn how exoplanet systems evolve, but also builds a more complete picture of our own solar system&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a rare opportunity to study catastrophic collisions occurring late in a planetary system&#8217;s history,&#8221; said Alycia Weinberger, staff scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science&#8217;s Department of Terrestrial Magnetism in Washington and lead investigator on the project. &#8220;The SOFIA observations show changes in the dusty disk on a timescale of only a few years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Infrared observations, such as those from SOFIA&#8217;s infrared camera (the Faint Object Infrared Camera for the SOFIA Telescope), are critical for uncovering clues hidden in cosmic dust. When observed with infrared light, this system is much brighter than expected from the stars alone. The extra energy comes from the glow of the dusty debris, which can&#8217;t be seen at other wavelengths.</p>
<p>While there are several mechanisms that could cause the dust to glow more brightly&#8212;it could be absorbing more heat from the stars or moving closer to the stars&#8212;these are unlikely to happen in just 10 years, which is lightning fast for cosmic changes. A planetary collision, however, would easily inject a large amount of dust very quickly. This provides more evidence that two exoplanets crashed into each other. The team is analyzing data from follow-up observations to see if there are further changes in the system.</p>

The goal is to introduce students and the public to some of the most important artists working today.</p>
<p>The 2019/20 series begins on October 29 with <strong>Sadie Barnette</strong>, a former artist-in-residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem, who utilizes drawing, photography and large-scale installation to make fantastical the personal, the mundane, and the political. Her recent works use as primary source material a 500-page FBI surveillance file that was kept on her father, Rodney Barnette, who founded the Compton, California, chapter of the Black Panther Party in 1968.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Oakland, Barnette&#8217;s work has been exhibited throughout the United States and internationally and is in the permanent collections of museums such as LACMA, Berkeley Art Museum, the California African American Museum, Studio Museum in Harlem, Brooklyn Museum and the Guggenheim. She is also the recipient of Art Matters and Artadia awards and has been featured in <em>The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Artforum</em>, and <em>Vogue</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the 2019/20 academic year, <em>Traction: Art Talks</em> will feature artists with national and international reputations whose work broadens our understandings of the relationship between art and struggles for social justice,&#8221; noted IAS interim director Rachel Nelson.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of the IAS programming--whether exhibitions, artist talks, or other events--reflects the conviction that the arts both offer profound insights and can have an impact on the most pressing political, social, and ecological questions of our time,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Upcoming speakers will include multimedia artist and activist <strong>Jackie Sumell</strong> on November 5. She will be joined by UCSC feminist studies professor Gina Dent in conversation following her talk.</p>
<p>Sumell&#8217;s art is driven by a deep commitment to addressing the abuses of&#160;the American criminal justice system, as exemplified by her 11-year collaborative project with the late Herman Wallace, one of the former Angola 3 prisoners, titled T<em>he House That Herman Built</em>. The project is the subject of a critically acclaimed documentary film,<em> Herman's House</em>, that aired on PBS.</p>
<p>Her powerful art project, <em>Solitary Garden</em>, will be on view at UC Santa Cruz from November 5, 2019 to December 6, 2020. The project explores conditions of solitary confinement and the garden will be designed by a person currently in solitary and documented by a UCSC team of collaborators.</p>
<p>The featured speakers for winter quarter will be <strong>Pablo Helguera</strong> on January 16, 2020 and <strong>Walid Raad</strong> on March 4.</p>
<p>Born in Mexico City, Helguera is a New York based artist who works with installation, sculpture, photography, drawing, socially engaged art and performance. Coinciding with his Traction: Art Talk, Helguera&#8217;s <em>Librer&#237;a Donceles</em>, an interactive art installation featuring thousands of Spanish language books, will be on display at Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History (MAH) through July 26, 2020.</p>
<p>Helguera&#8217;s work focuses on a variety of topics that include history, ethnography, memory and the absurd, which are presented in formats ranging from lectures and exhibitions to musical performances and written fiction. His project, &#8220;The School of Panamerican Unrest,&#8221; a nomadic think-tank that physically crossed the continent by car from Anchorage, Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, is considered one of the most extensive public art projects on record as well as a pioneering work for the new generation of artworks regarded under the area of socially engaged art.</p>
<p>Helguera has worked since 1991&#160;in a variety of contemporary art museums and was head of public programs at the Education department of the Guggenheim Museum in New York (1998-2005). Since 2007, he has been Director of Adult and Academic programs at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Hellguera has organized close to 1,000 public events in conjunction with nearly 100 exhibitions.</p>
<p><strong>Walid Raad</strong> is an internationally renowned contemporary media artist. His work is informed by his upbringing in Lebanon during the civil war (1975&#8211;91), and by the socioeconomic and military policies that have shaped the Middle East in the past few decades.</p>
<p>For The Atlas Group, a 15-year project exploring the contemporary history of Lebanon, he produced fictionalized photographs, videotapes, notebooks, and lectures that related to real events and authentic research in audio, film, and photographic archives in Lebanon and elsewhere. These fictional archives are now held in museums around the world.</p>
<p>Raad&#8217;s works have been exhibited at Documenta 11 in Kassel, Germany, The Venice Bennale in Venice, Italy, The Whitney Biennial in New York, and The Ayloul Festival in Beirut, Lebanon, as well as other events and museums throughout North America, Europe, and the Middle East.&#160;Raad was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in 2009; was selected as a finalist for the 2010 Hugo Boss Prize at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; and was awarded the Hasselblad Foundation International Award in Photography in 2011. He currently lives in New York, where he is an associate professor at the Cooper Union School of Art.</p>
<p>All of the <em>Traction: Art Talks</em> take place at the Digital Arts Research Center (DARC 108) on the UC Santa Cruz campus. Admission is free and open to the public.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f998fd1180727017605850f7df8364bc"><name>avoid-email-scam-targeting-students</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Avoid email scam targeting students</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department has been notified of an email scam being perpetrated on students from someone saying they work at Cisco Systems, Inc. and need to hire a student as a part-time personal assistant.</summary><start-date>1571814000000</start-date><display-name>Avoid email scam targeting students</display-name><path>/2019/10/avoid-email-scam-targeting-students</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/10/avoid-email-scam-targeting-students</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1571850616039</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1571850616039</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department has been notified of an email scam being perpetrated on students from someone saying they work at Cisco Systems, Inc. and need to hire a student as a part-time personal assistant.</span></p>

<p>The study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.13968">published October 25 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em></a>, looked at 144 tumor samples from 128 pediatric cancer patients enrolled in four precision medicine clinical studies in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>For an increasing number of cancer patients, doctors analyze the specific gene mutations in the patient's tumor to help select the best treatment. In children, however, this kind of genetic profiling of tumors is much less likely to reveal a target for therapy, according to first author Olena Vaske, who holds the Colligan Presidential Chair in Pediatric Genomics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"In pediatric cancer, it often isn't a DNA mutation driving the cancer but an error in development caused by a change in how gene expression is regulated," Vaske explained.</p>
<p>Vaske's team at the UCSC <a href="https://treehousegenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative</a> has focused their efforts on analysis of gene expression data derived from RNA sequencing. When a gene is turned on, or activated, its DNA sequence is transcribed into a messenger RNA molecule. Sequencing the RNA molecules in tumor cells reveals not only which genes are turned on in those cells, but also how active they are (a more active gene makes more RNA transcripts).</p>
<p>Using the Treehouse Initiative's framework for comparative RNA sequence analysis of pediatric tumors, each patient's data were compared to a compendium of over 11,000 tumor RNA sequencing samples from public genomic datasets. The analysis identified unusual gene expression patterns that could be used to identify druggable genes and pathways for each patient.</p>
<p>"We're looking for the outliers, the over-expressed genes that are unusual compared to other cells and that might be driving this patient's disease," Vaske said.</p>
<p>The researchers found that gene expression analysis was potentially useful for 68% of the 144 tumor samples. In contrast, DNA mutation information was potentially useful for only 46% of the samples. In 36% of the samples, druggable over-expressed genes and pathways were identified based on RNA analysis alone and were not apparent in the tumor DNA analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical partners</strong></p>
<p>This cohort study was conducted as a consortium of five institutions: UC Santa Cruz, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford, Children's Hospital of Orange County, and the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium. The clinical partners sent UCSC researchers the RNA sequencing data for children and young adults with relapsed, refractory, or rare cancer who were being treated on precision medicine protocols. Each clinical site had its own precision medicine protocol in place, and UCSC served as a third-party institution conducting secondary analysis of each site's tumor data.</p>
<p>"This was designed as a feasibility study to show that we can do this&#8212;get the data for prospective patients and process and analyze it fast enough to be useful," said Vaske, an assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC. "We showed for the first time that this framework can be used consistently across separate precision medicine clinical trials."</p>
<p>Although the study was not designed to assess clinical impact, the researchers did see correlations between the findings from gene expression analysis and the clinical responses of some patients.</p>
<p>The study also demonstrates the value of consolidating data from publicly available genomic datasets. The UCSC team processed all of the RNA sequencing data, from both public datasets and clinical partners, in a uniform way before doing the comparative analyses. The compendium of consolidated data, which now includes more than 12,000 tumor samples, is available to cancer researchers on the Treehouse Initiative's website. The team has now also built a compendium of RNA sequencing data from normal tissues.</p>
<p>"For the comparative analyses, it's a numbers game, so the larger the compendium, the more robust the analysis will be. That's why we believe so strongly in open sharing of data," Vaske said.</p>
<p>The Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative, which Vaske cofounded, brings the power of genomics and big-data analytics to bear on the challenge of finding effective treatments for children with cancer. Working with clinical partners, the Treehouse team now routinely participates in clinical "tumor boards," where doctors and geneticists meet to share information and ideas on treatments for individual cancer patients.</p>
<p>"The next step will be to directly evaluate the clinical utility of this approach. This study has set the stage for us to do that," Vaske said.</p>
<p>The Treehouse Initiative's research has been funded by St. Baldrick&#8217;s Foundation, the California Initiative to Advance Precision Medicine, Unravel Pediatric Cancer, Team G Childhood Cancer Foundation, Live for Others Foundation, and Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation for Childhood Cancer Research.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ff9af3d580727017605850f7c18f9f25"><name>desi-first-light</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>DESI opens its 5,000 eyes to capture the colors of the cosmos</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz astronomers have played leading roles in the collaborative effort to install a new sky-surveying instrument now beginning final testing.</summary><keywords>Connie Rockosi, Alexie Leauthaud</keywords><start-date>1572274800000</start-date><display-name>DESI opens its 5,000 eyes to capture the colors of the cosmos</display-name><path>/2019/10/desi-first-light</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/10/desi-first-light</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1571951408056</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1572283248711</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/desi-spectrum-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/desi-spectrum-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>desi-spectrum-450.jpg</name><display-name>desi-spectrum-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>174000</file-size><width>450</width><height>552</height></image><image-alt>image of galaxy and spectrum from it</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/desi-spectrum-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/desi-spectrum-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>desi-spectrum-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>desi-spectrum-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18413</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>image of Triangulum galaxy</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>DESI&#8217;s 5,000 spectroscopic &#8220;eyes&#8221; can cover an area of sky about 38 times larger than that of the full moon, as seen in this overlay of DESI&#8217;s focal plane on the night sky (top).

<p>It was the first test of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, known as DESI, with its nearly complete complement of components. The long-awaited instrument is designed to explore the mystery of dark energy, which makes up about 68 percent of the universe and is speeding up its expansion.</p>
<p>Connie Rockosi, professor and co-chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, serves on the DESI Leadership Team. As the commissioning scientist, she has the job of planning and coordinating the work of a team of scientists and engineers from throughout the DESI collaboration to demonstrate that the instrument is ready to start scientific observations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a real thrill to be part of making everything come together as a working instrument that will do exciting science. This is a milestone achievement of many years of work by many people in DESI,&#8221; Rockosi said.</p>
<p>DESI&#8217;s components are designed to automatically point at preselected sets of galaxies, gather their light, and then split that light into narrow bands of color to precisely map their distance from Earth and gauge how much the universe expanded as this light traveled to Earth. In ideal conditions, DESI can cycle through a new set of 5,000 galaxies every 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The latest milestone marks the opening of DESI&#8217;s final testing toward the formal start of observations in early 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Time machine</strong></p>
<p>Like a powerful time machine, DESI will peer deeply into the universe&#8217;s infancy and early development&#8212;up to about 11 billion years ago&#8212;to create the most detailed 3-D map of the universe.</p>
<p>By repeatedly mapping the distance to 35 million galaxies and 2.4 million quasars across one-third of the area of the sky over its five-year run, DESI will teach us more about dark energy. Quasars, among the brightest objects in the universe, allow DESI to look deeply into the universe&#8217;s past.</p>
<p>DESI will provide very precise measurements of the universe&#8217;s expansion rate. Gravity had slowed this rate of expansion in the early universe, though dark energy has since been responsible for speeding up its expansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;After a decade in planning and R&amp;D, installation and assembly, we are delighted that DESI can soon begin its quest to unravel the mystery of dark energy,&#8221; said DESI Director Michael Levi of the Department of Energy&#8217;s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), the lead institution for DESI&#8217;s construction and operations.</p>
<p>"Most of the universe&#8217;s matter and energy are dark and unknown, and next-generation experiments like DESI are our best bet for unraveling these mysteries,&#8221; Levi added. &#8220;I am thrilled to see this new experiment come to life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DESI collaboration has participation from nearly 500 researchers at 75 institutions in 13 countries. At UC Santa Cruz, Alexie Leauthaud and J. Xavier Prochaska, both professors of astronomy and astrophysics, are involved in the collaboration along with Rockosi. Leauthaud serves on the DESI Science Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>Installation of DESI began in February 2018 at the Nicholas U. Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. &#8220;With DESI we are combining a modern instrument with a venerable old telescope to make a state-of-the-art survey machine.&#8221; said Lori Allen, director of Kitt Peak National Observatory at the National Science Foundation&#8217;s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory.</p>
<p>Over the past 18 months, a bevy of DESI components were shipped to the site from institutions around the globe and installed on the telescope. Jiani Ding, an astronomy graduate student from UC Santa Cruz, has been on site to help with the installation.</p>
<p>Among the early arrivals was an assembly of lenses packaged in a large steel barrel, together weighing in at three tons. This corrector barrel sits over the 4-meter primary mirror of the Mayall Telescope and provides an expansive field of view. The lenses, each measuring about a meter across, were successfully tested in April.</p>
<p>DESI&#8217;s focal plane, which carries 5,000 robotic positioners that swivel in a choreographed &#8220;dance&#8221; to focus&#160;individually on galaxies, is at the top of the telescope.</p>
<p>These little robots&#8212;which each hold a light-gathering fiber-optic cable that is about the average width of a human hair&#8212;serve as DESI&#8217;s eyes. It takes about 10 seconds for the positioners to swivel to a new sequence of targeted galaxies. With its unprecedented surveying speed, DESI will map over 20 times more objects than any predecessor experiment.</p>
<p>The focal plane, which is comprised of a half-million individual parts, is arranged in a series of 10 wedge-shaped petals that each contain 500 positioners and a little camera to help the telescope point and focus.</p>
<p>The focal plane, corrector barrel, and other DESI components weigh 11 tons, and the Mayall telescope&#8217;s movable arm that DESI is installed on weighs 250 tons and rises 90 feet above the floor in the Mayall&#8217;s 14-story dome.</p>
<p>Among the more recent arrivals at Kitt Peak is the collection of spectrographs that are designed to split up the gathered light into three separate color bands to allow precise distance measurements of the observed galaxies across a broad range of colors.</p>
<p>These spectrographs, which allow DESI&#8217;s robotic eyes to &#8220;see&#8221; even faint, distant galaxies, are designed to measure redshift, which is a shift in the color of objects to longer, redder wavelengths due to the objects&#8217; movement away from us. Redshift is analogous to how the sound of a fire engine&#8217;s siren shifts to lower tones as it moves away from us.</p>
<p>There are now eight spectrographs installed, with the final two arriving before year-end. To connect the focal plane with the spectrographs, which are located beneath the telescope, DESI is equipped with about 150 miles of fiber-optic cabling.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very exciting moment,&#8221; said Nathalie Palanque-Delabrouille, a DESI spokesperson and an astrophysics researcher at France&#8217;s Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) who has participated in the selection process to determine which galaxies and other objects DESI will observe.</p>
<p>&#8220;The instrument is all there. It has been very exciting to be a part of this from the start,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is a very significant advance compared to previous experiments. By looking at objects very far away from us, we can actually map the history of the universe and see what the universe is composed of by looking at very different objects from different eras.&#8221;</p>
<p>Palanque-Delabrouille&#8217;s institution, CEA, contributed a specialized cooling system to optimize the performance of the light sensors (known as CCDs or charge-coupled devices) that enable DESI&#8217;s broad color-sampling range.</p>
<p>Gregory Tarl&#233;, a physics professor at the University of Michigan (UM) who led the student teams that assembled the robotic positioners for DESI and related components, said it&#8217;s gratifying to reach a stage in the project where all of DESI&#8217;s complex components are functioning together.</p>
<p>UM delivered a total of 7,300 robotic positioners, including spares. During the production peak, the teams were churning out about 50 positioners a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was quite a process,&#8221; Tarl&#233; said. &#8220;We were at the limits of precision for these production parts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The positioners were installed in the focal plane petals at Berkeley Lab, and after assembly and testing the completed petals were shipped to Kitt Peak and installed one at a time on the Mayall Telescope.</p>
<p>Now that the hard work of building DESI is largely done, Tarl&#233; said he looks forward to DESI discoveries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to find out what the nature of dark energy is,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We finally have a shot at really trying to understand the nature of this stuff that dominates the universe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Innovative scholars from a wide range of disciplines will participate in an effort to channel the vital, open-ended, iconoclastic spirit of White, professor emeritus in UCSC&#8217;s History of Consciousness Department, who died last year in his Santa Cruz home at the age of 89.</p>
<p>White was trained as a medieval historian, but the majority of his work focused on modern European intellectual history, literary criticism, philosophy, and historiography--the study of historical writing.<br/> <br/> He first gained notice in 1966 with an essay, &#8220;The Burden of History,&#8221; laying the foundation for his later work, which re-imagined history as a creative, as well as scientific history. His landmark book published in 1973,&#160;<em>Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe</em>, initiated a major re-orientation in the field of historiography and has been translated into more than 10 languages.<br/> <br/> "Hayden White was a towering figure bridging intellectual history and cultural theory,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz dean of humanities, Tyler Stovall.&#160;&#8220;His&#160;<em>Metahistory</em>&#160;remains one of the most important studies of historiography in the modern era. His focus on narrative and the relationship between history and literature exercised a seminal influence on the rise of cultural history to its dominant position in historical studies today."<br/> <br/> Stovall added that White also &#8220;played a central role in shaping the History of Consciousness Department into a one-of-a-kind program that pioneered theoretical and cultural studies, and helped stamp UC Santa Cruz as a university that marched to a different drummer."&#160;</p>
<p><strong>The conference is being coordinated</strong> by three of White&#8217;s colleagues at UC Santa Cruz: emeritus history of consciousness professor James Clifford, philosophy professor Paul Roth, and literature professor Karen Bassi.</p>
<p>&#8220;After Hayden&#8217;s death, many at UCSC felt there needed to be some visible recognition of his importance as a scholar and, especially as an inspiration to younger intellectuals doing work in a wide range of fields,&#8221; said Clifford.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was an intellectual powerhouse, inspiring and challenging students and faculty alike,&#8221; Clifford added. &#8220;On his arrival in Santa Cruz, his magnum opus, <em>Metahistory</em>, was already making waves. And during his time here, he published a series of influential essay collections on the practice and rhetoric of historical interpretation. World-famous, he was always present and down-to-earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Clifford said that the conference will not be a retrospective evaluation or summing up of White&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike many academic conferences, shaped around a series of 'topics' imposed by the organizers, we decided simply to invite brilliant intellectuals who knew Hayden and have been influenced by him--asking them to offer something new that is based, at least in part, on his ideas. Of course, Hayden White will be part of their discourse, but not the primary focus or the end point. So the conference hopes to be a place of emergence, of surprises. We&#8217;ll see what happens. The only things out of bounds are reverence and literal-mindedness. These were anathema to the Hayden I knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roth observed that White's work essentially defined the range of topics discussed in the theory of history for the last 50 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although theory of history is not much studied in the United States, in pretty much any continent or country one can name outside the U.S. it is a core part of the history curriculum," said Roth. "I have spoken at conferences ranging from Stockholm to Shanghai, and Hayden White&#8217;s work is known and closely studied. In places as diverse as China, Argentina, and Poland, one can find whole university centers devoted to the study of White&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason, I suggest, is that outside the U.S. people must face more directly the consequences of how history gets told, since it underwrites what claims there may be to national identity and unity. In any case, Hayden&#8217;s work has had a profound impact on the topic of historiography worldwide, and there is no reason to think that this impact will diminish with his passing. The conference here is dedicated to pushing his thought in new directions and not just rehashing familiar themes. We hope people will find it of interest.&#8221;</p>

Instruction, academic activities, and regular operations are expected to continue, unless the situation changes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">PG&amp;E reports that power may go out to some areas of our region Tuesday night. Planned outages are dynamic and fluid situations. Community members should continue to check email and UCSC.edu/status for updates. Critical information will be shared via CruzAlert.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some areas of Santa Cruz County may still be without power, including the westside. Motorists and bicyclists should use extreme caution when driving in areas where stoplights are not working and anticipate additional congestion during peak travel times.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the coastline, beachgoers should be careful as a northwest swell will bring an increased risk of sneaker waves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus community&#8217;s patience and commitment to fulfilling the university&#8217;s mission during these outages is deeply appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the campus power situation, employees might be experiencing power outages at their homes. Managers should try to be flexible with employees. Employees should check with their manager or supervisor if they have specific questions or concerns about being able to make it to work due to their personal power circumstances.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Safety first</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus community should try to avoid using elevators during this possible power shutdown as a precaution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, campus community members who live off campus should avoid going to any campus facilities if power is out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees should remain in regular contact with their manager or supervisor about alternative plans should campus sites lose power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The complex nature of the power grid means that UC Santa Cruz sites across the region may be affected differently. If the residential campus loses power, some parts of campus may remain online, powered by our cogeneration plant. Additionally, some buildings have backup generators in place to supply emergency lighting. Some buildings would be without power entirely. If power goes out, all events at affected sites will be cancelled.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz may proactively switch a number of buildings to independent power provided by our cogeneration plant. Researchers and staff are advised to take appropriate pre-emptive and cautionary measures to protect critical equipment at any site.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>

Who is moving forward? Who is funding research? And who is being left out of the conversation?</p>
<p>The "hidden politics" of climate engineering were partially revealed earlier this year at the fourth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-4), when Switzerland proposed a resolution on geoengineering governance. The ensuing debate offered a glimpse of the first discussion in a public forum of this "third rail" of climate change, according to Sikina Jinnah, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and an expert on climate engineering governance.</p>
<p>In a commentary that appears in the current issue of <em>Nature Geoscience</em>, Jinnah and coauthor Simon Nicholson of American University describe the politics and players who appear to be shaping the discussion. Their analysis, "The Hidden Politics of Climate Engineering," concludes with a call for transparency to help resolve questions of governance and "ensure that the world has the tools to manage these potent technologies and practices if and when decisions are ever taken to use them."</p>
<p>"Twenty years ago, climate engineering seemed far-fetched&#8212;if not crazy&#8212;but these ideas are being taken more seriously today in the wake of widespread governmental failure to adequately reduce greenhouse gas emissions," said Jinnah. "The U.S is the biggest culprit in terms of shirking responsibility, but everyone is falling short."</p>
<p>The Swiss proposal generated debate that revealed troubling schisms between the United States and the European Union. It also underscored the challenge of trying to establish governance for the two dominant geoengineering strategies&#8212;solar radiation management (SRM) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR)&#8212;at the same time, because the technologies present very different potential risks.</p>
<p>Still a purely theoretical strategy, SRM would involve altering planetary brightness to reflect a very small amount of sunlight away from the Earth to create a cooling effect. One well-known proposal is to inject tiny reflective particles into the upper atmosphere. "The idea is to mimic the effect of a volcanic eruption," said Jinnah. "Many people are scared of its planet-altering potential, and rightfully so." When a team at Harvard University announced its intention to do a small-scale outdoor experiment, the public backlash was swift; amid calls for a more inclusive process, the project timeline was pushed back to include input from a newly established advisory board.</p>
<p>By contrast, CDR has to this point been relatively less controversial. Carbon removal strategies include existing options like enhancing forest carbon sinks, and more technologically far-off options such as "direct air capture" strategies that would suck carbon from the atmosphere. CDR is baked into many climate-modeling scenarios, largely in the form of bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). BECCS involves the burning of biomass for energy, followed by the capture and underground storage of emissions.</p>
<p>"Climate engineering experts are not talking about this as a substitute for greenhouse gas emission reductions," emphasized Jinnah. "The potential of climate engineering is to lessen the impacts of climate change that we're going to experience regardless of what we do now."&#160;</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Debate reveals areas of concern</u></em></strong></p>
<p>To piece together their account of what happened at the UNEA-4 meeting, Jinnah and Nicholson interviewed attendees, reviewed documents, and scoured online comments. Their analysis highlights several areas of concern, including:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>Disagreement among countries about the current state and strength of SRM governance</li>
<li>The domination of research by North American and European scientists</li>
<li>The need to "decouple" governance of SRM and CDR</li>
<li>A significant split between the United States and the European Union over the "precautionary approach"</li>
</ul>
<p>The key functions of governance include building transparency, fostering public participation, and shedding light on funding. Jinnah noted that governance can also provide what she called a "braking" mechanism to avoid what some call a "slippery slope" toward deployment.</p>
<p>Significantly, the Swiss proposal, which Jinnah and Nicholson describe as "modest," suggested a preliminary governance framework that drew strong opposition from the United States and Saudi Arabia. "The United States&#160; wants to keep its options open, and it certainly doesn't want the United Nations telling it what it can and cannot do," observed Jinnah.</p>
<p>The lack of transparency around climate engineering makes it difficult to get a comprehensive picture of who's doing what, and where, said Jinnah, but academic scientists in North America and Europe are leading the effort to explore SRM technology; CDR is already attracting private investment. Little is known about the extent of China's activity in climate engineering.</p>
<p>"Very little is happening in the developing world, which is problematic because they will experience the most dramatic impacts of climate change and have the least institutional capacity to cope with it," said Jinnah. "Some countries are facing an existential crisis and could potentially&#8212;<em>potentially</em>&#8212;want to see climate engineering. Or they could oppose it, because they want the focus to be on emissions reduction. But we don't know, because governments haven't articulated their positions."</p>
<p>Jinnah bemoaned the lack of collaboration with developing countries and expressed a desire to see them build their capacity to engage with the policy and politics of climate engineering.</p>
<p>The debate also underscored some of the differences between SRM and CDR in terms of potential viability and deployment, prompting Jinnah to observe that "decoupling" them might break the logjam and foster greater progress on parallel tracks.</p>
<p>The United States favored a far less "precautionary" stance than the European Union, which has historically opted to protect the environment in the absence of scientific certainty, as it did on the issue of genetically modified foods. As one of the few countries with an active SRM research program, the United States appeared eager to preserve the status quo and "leave its decision space unchallenged," Jinnah and Nicholson wrote.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>An important step forward</u></em></strong></p>
<p>Despite the breadth and depth of disagreement that surfaced at the meeting, Jinnah sees the debate as a necessary first step. "As a researcher, I think this debate was an incredibly important step forward, because you can't study the politics of this issue without data, which in this case is countries articulating their positions on this controversial issue," she said.</p>
<p>"Research is needed so we can better understand our options," she emphasized, then added: "I'd rather not live in a world that thinks about solar radiation management, but unfortunately that's not our reality."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="188940b680727017760172d3a75fc250"><name>mangroves</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Mangroves reduce flood damages during hurricanes, saving billions of dollars in property losses</title><summary>A new report finds that mangroves provide valuable flood risk benefits and play a critical role in protecting coastal communities in Florida.</summary><keywords>Michael Beck, Siddharth Narayan</keywords><start-date>1572332400000</start-date><display-name>Mangroves reduce flood damages during hurricanes, saving billions of dollars in property losses</display-name><path>/2019/10/mangroves</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/10/mangroves</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1572369678490</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1572372915718</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Fran Perchick, TNC</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/punta-gorda-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/punta-gorda-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>punta-gorda-410.jpg</name><display-name>punta-gorda-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>160110</file-size><width>410</width><height>410</height></image><image-alt>mangroves</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/punta-gorda-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/punta-gorda-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>punta-gorda-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>punta-gorda-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>30671</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>mangroves</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Mangroves near Punta Gorda, Florida.

The study brought together a team of scientists from the engineering, insurance, and conservation sectors to quantify the effectiveness of mangroves in reducing flood risk to people and property.</p>
<p>Their report, <a href="http://www.conservationgateway.org/pages/Florida-Mangroves.aspx">Valuing The Flood Risk Reduction Benefits of Florida&#8217;s Mangroves</a>, concludes that mangroves in Florida prevented $1.5 billion in direct flood damages and protected over half a million people during Hurricane Irma in 2017, reducing damages by nearly 25% in counties with mangroves. With coastal challenges created by growing populations, burgeoning development, and climate change, risks to people and property from flooding and storm surge are on the rise. Mangroves provide valuable flood protection and risk reduction benefits to these coastal areas, yet they are a threatened species.</p>
<p>&#8220;This work helps to identify where to invest cost effectively in habitat restoration and conservation, which is critical for building coastal resilience,&#8221; said project team leader Michael Beck, research professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The study used the risk insurance industry&#8217;s latest and most rigorous high-resolution flood and loss catastrophe models and an extensive database of property exposure to estimate property damages from storms with and without mangroves in Florida. The report shows that mangroves significantly reduce flood levels during a catastrophic event such as Hurricane Irma.</p>
<p>The report goes further to show the annual benefits from mangroves across many storms. In Collier County, the team analyzed flood damages for 100 storms and found that annual flood damages would increase by 25% should the county suffer the loss of its mangrove forests.</p>
<p>Mangroves are most effective in flood risk reduction where they are abundant and located in front of areas with high densities of people and property. In Lee and Collier Counties, closest to where Hurricane Irma made landfall on the Florida mainland, mangroves are estimated to have prevented losses of $802 million and $580 million respectively. In vulnerable Miami-Dade County, urban coastal mangroves protected high-value coastal properties from over $134 million in potential flood damages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mangroves can be remarkably effective as natural defenses against storms, and this study shows that we have the tools to measure their effectiveness as we would for any other coastal defense,&#8221; said Siddharth Narayan, a coastal engineer at UC Santa Cruz and lead author of the study.</p>
<p>The study also found that in cases where properties were developed in high risk areas in front of mangroves, the presence of the mangroves could increase damages to those properties.</p>
<p>The findings make a compelling economic case for protecting and restoring mangroves as natural defenses for risk reduction. Consideration of the economic value of these natural systems is critical in planning and development along Florida&#8217;s coastline, where mangroves currently occupy only a fraction of their historical extent because of development and other hydrologic modifications.</p>
<p>&#8220;The magnitude of benefits provided by mangroves are all the more essential for our coastal communities as they experience heightened risk of flooding and extreme weather conditions. This study further strengthens the Nature Conservancy&#8217;s commitment to protecting and restoring mangroves as an important investment and risk reduction strategy,&#8221; said Temperince Morgan, executive director of the Nature Conservancy in Florida.</p>
<p>The study is one in a large body of growing evidence that coastal habitats serve as critical natural defenses from storms. The new study complements recent work on the value of Florida&#8217;s reefs for storm protection, which further highlights the billions of dollars in benefits that these habitats deliver to Florida taxpayers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study underlines the critical role played by natural defenses in the reduction of economic losses from hurricane-driven storm surges and the importance of properly accounting for mangroves and other coastal habitats in coastal flood risk models. Modeling the impact of mangroves at high resolution, we can put a value on the risk reduction benefits they bring to coastal properties every year,&#8221; said Christopher Thomas, lead modeler at RMS.</p>
<p>The study was led by UC Santa Cruz, Risk Management Solutions, and the Nature Conservancy, with support for this project provided by the Walton Family Foundation and the Herbert W. Hoover Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="195bb37680727017760172d33ce9a721"><name>giant-planets</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Simulations explain giant exoplanets with eccentric, close-in orbits</title><summary>A giant-impacts phase in the evolution of planetary systems can explain the observations of close-in giant planets with eccentric orbits.</summary><keywords>Ruth Murray-Clay</keywords><start-date>1572418800000</start-date><display-name>Simulations explain giant exoplanets with eccentric, close-in orbits</display-name><path>/2019/10/giant-planets</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/10/giant-planets</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1572383470428</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1572449442550</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/giant-impact-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/giant-impact-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>giant-impact-410.jpg</name><display-name>giant-impact-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>57774</file-size><width>410</width><height>328</height></image><image-alt>planets colliding</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/giant-impact-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/giant-impact-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>giant-impact-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>giant-impact-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15972</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>planets colliding</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>This artist's concept illustrates the collision of two rocky planets.

Smaller planets should be more susceptible to this gravitational scattering, yet many gas giant exoplanets have been observed with eccentric orbits very different from the roughly circular orbits of the planets in our own solar system.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the planets with the highest masses tend to be those with the highest eccentricities, even though the inertia of a larger mass should make it harder to budge from its initial orbit. This counter-intuitive observation prompted astronomers at UC Santa Cruz to explore the evolution of planetary systems using computer simulations. Their results, reported in a paper <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab4a7b">published in<em> Astrophysical Journal Letters</em></a>, suggest a crucial role for a giant-impacts phase in the evolution of high-mass planetary systems, leading to collisional growth of multiple giant planets with close-in orbits.</p>
<p>"A giant planet is not as easily scattered into an eccentric orbit as a smaller planet, but if there are multiple giant planets close to the host star, their gravitational interactions are more likely scatter them into eccentric orbits," explained first author Renata Frelikh, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Frelikh performed hundreds of simulations of planetary systems, starting each one with 10 planets in circular orbits and varying the initial total mass of the system and the masses of individual planets. As the systems evolved for 20 million simulated years, dynamical instabilities led to collisions and mergers to form larger planets as well as gravitational interactions that ejected some planets and scattered others into eccentric orbits.</p>
<p>Analyzing the results of these simulations collectively, the researchers found that the planetary systems with the most initial total mass produced the biggest planets and the planets with the highest eccentricities.</p>
<p>"Our model naturally explains the counter-intuitive correlation of mass and eccentricity," Frelikh said.</p>
<p>Coauthor Ruth Murray-Clay, the Gunderson professor of theoretical astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, said the only non-standard assumption in their model is that there can be several gas giant planets in the inner part of a planetary system. "If you make that assumption, all the other behavior follows," she said.</p>
<p>According to the classic model of planet formation, based on our own solar system, there is not enough material in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk around a star to make gas giant planets, so only small rocky planets form in the inner part of the system and giant planets form farther out. Yet astronomers have detected many gas giants orbiting close to their host stars. Because they are relatively easy to detect, these "hot Jupiters" accounted for the majority of early exoplanet discoveries, but they may be an uncommon outcome of planet formation.</p>
<p>"This may be an unusual process," Murray-Clay said. "We're suggesting that it is more likely to happen when the initial mass in the disk is high, and that high-mass giant planets are produced during a phase of giant impacts."</p>
<p>This giant-impacts phase is analogous to the final stage in the assembly of our own solar system, when the moon was formed in the aftermath of a collision between Earth and another planet. "Because of our solar system bias, we tend to think of impacts as happening to rocky planets and ejection as happening to giant planets, but there is a whole spectrum of possible outcomes in the evolution of planetary systems," Murray-Clay said.</p>
<p>According to Frelikh, collisional growth of high-mass giant planets should be most efficient in the inner regions, because encounters between planets in the outer parts of the system are more likely to lead to ejections than mergers. Mergers producing high-mass planets should peak at a distance from the host star of around 3 astronomical units (AU, the distance from Earth to the sun), she said.</p>
<p>"We predict that the highest-mass giant planets will be produced by mergers of smaller gas giants between 1 to 8 AU from their host stars," Frelikh said. "Exoplanet surveys have detected some extremely large exoplanets, approaching 20 times the mass of Jupiter. It may take a lot of collisions to produce those, so it's interesting that we see this giant-impacts phase in our simulations."</p>
<p>In addition to Frelikh and Murray-Clay, the coauthors of the paper include Hyerin Jang at UC Santa Cruz and Cristobal Petrovich at the University of Toronto.

<p>The prize recognizes Tracy and Widom for their 1994 paper "Level-spacing distributions and the Airy kernel," published in <em>Communications in Mathematical Physics</em>. This paper, which introduced what are now known as Tracy-Widom distributions, is considered a major breakthrough of lasting importance.</p>
<p>Widom's early research was in the areas of integral equations and operator theory, which led to a later interest in random matrix theory and his long-lasting collaboration with Tracy. Widom and Tracy shared the prestigious George P&#243;lya Prize in 2002 for their work, and later received the 2007 Norbert Wiener Prize in Applied Mathematics.</p>
<p>A fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Mathematical Society, Widom received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1955 and joined the UCSC faculty in 1968. He was awarded the Edward A. Dickson Emeriti Professorship in 2007.</p>
<p>The Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research is awarded annually for a paper, whether recent or not, that has proved to be of fundamental or lasting importance in its field or a model of important research. The subject area of the prize rotates among six research areas. The 2020 prize will be awarded on Thursday, January 16, during the Joint Prize Session at the 2020 Joint Mathematics Meetings in Denver.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="19ba0d8d80727017760172d3e5e3d3cf"><name>lux-supercomputer</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Powerful new supercomputer supports campus research in physical sciences</title><summary>UCSC faculty are using the new system for research in astrophysics, climate science, materials science, chemistry, and other fields.</summary><keywords>Brant Robertson</keywords><start-date>1572418800000</start-date><display-name>Powerful new supercomputer supports campus research in physical sciences</display-name><path>/2019/10/lux-supercomputer</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/10/lux-supercomputer</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1572389653873</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1572450591771</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value><value>Applied Mathematics and Statistics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value><value>Earth Sciences</value><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/supercomputer-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/supercomputer-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>supercomputer-450.jpg</name><display-name>supercomputer-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>104677</file-size><width>450</width><height>332</height></image><image-alt>lux supercomputer</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/10/images/supercomputer-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/10/images/supercomputer-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>supercomputer-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>supercomputer-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27922</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>lux supercomputer</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Astrophysicist Brant Robertson (left) and team members Nicholas Brummell (Applied Mathematics) and Brad Smith (Computer Science and Engineering) with the new lux supercomputer recently installed in the UCSC Data Center.

The new system, called lux, is substantially more powerful than previous campus supercomputers and was designed with the latest technologies to enable advanced computational studies in areas such as climate modeling, astrophysical simulations, and machine learning.</p>
<p>"I'm excited about leveraging these new technologies to do computational studies we weren't able to do before at UC Santa Cruz," said Brant Robertson, associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics.</p>
<p>Robertson led a team of 20 UCSC faculty members from six departments to put together a proposal for the project, which won a $1.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation's Major Research Instrumentation program. The team includes faculty in the Departments of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, Earth and Planetary Sciences, Physics, Applied Mathematics, and Computer Science &amp; Engineering.</p>
<p>High-performance computing has become an increasingly important tool for researchers throughout the physical sciences. Sophisticated computer simulations can be used to model extremely complex phenomena, from the behavior of Earth's climate system to the evolution of galaxies. In addition, scientists in a growing number of fields are applying the computationally intensive techniques of machine learning to problems involving large datasets.</p>
<p>"In astronomy, we are just starting to deploy deep learning at large scale. When we are able to automate the analysis of astronomical images from large surveys, it will revolutionize how we do astronomy," Robertson said.</p>
<p>Although researchers may have access to much bigger supercomputers than lux at national computing facilities operated by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, Robertson said it is crucial for UC Santa Cruz to have its own local system.</p>
<p>"If you want to develop code to run on the largest supercomputer in the world, you need to have a local system that has the same high-end components. We designed lux so that it can serve as a springboard for our researchers to get time on the national systems," he said.</p>
<p>Lux is also important for training students in the latest computational techniques. It will be available to students in advanced computational courses and programs such as the <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/lamat/">Lamat </a>program in computational astrophysics, as well as visiting scientists and participants in summer programs.</p>
<p>Robertson said there are already about 100 different accounts on the lux system. "People are up and running on it," he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1d589fd180727017760172d363d6834c"><name>update-suspicious-person-driving-white-pickup</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update—Suspicious person driving a white Ford pickup</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department has been able to identify the subject in this investigation.</summary><start-date>1572332460000</start-date><display-name>Update—Suspicious person driving a white Ford pickup</display-name><path>/2019/10/update-suspicious-person-driving-white-pickup</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/10/update-suspicious-person-driving-white-pickup</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1572450377656</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1572450377656</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department has been able to identify the subject in this investigation.

Littlefield Foundation is helping first-generation students succeed and generating research on practices that can support students across the country </article-subhead><article-text><p>Last June, a steady stream of students walked through the office of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s First Generation Initiative, sharing smiling photos of themselves wearing black T-shirts emblazoned with &#8220;#FIRSTGEN COLLEGE GRAD&#8221; on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>More than 3,600 first-generation UC Santa Cruz students&#8212;those whose parents had not graduated from a four-year college or university&#8212;graduated this year, proud families cheering them on.</p>
<p>The constant flow of posts barely scratched the surface. First-generation students comprised well over half of the students who earned graduate and undergraduate degrees at UC Santa Cruz in 2019&#8212;a striking reflection of the university&#8217;s commitment to <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/usnwr-social-mobility.html">social mobility</a>.</p>
<p>This celebration has a purpose: By increasing the visibility of students who are the first in their families to attend college, the university can help first-generation students succeed in reaching graduation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Highlighting first-generation student narratives builds first-generation students&#8217; sense that they belong and can succeed,&#8221; says Rebecca Covarrubias, associate professor of psychology and co-leader of the <a href="https://firstgen.ucsc.edu/">First Generation Initiative.</a></p>
<h3>Changing the conversation</h3>
<p>Assistant Vice Chancellor Gwynn Benner co-leads the program with Covarrubias. She sees the work as potentially creating models useful well beyond the UC Santa Cruz campus. <br/><br/>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to change the conversation about what it means to be first-gen,&#8221; Benner said.</p>
<p>For the past year, the Jacques M. Littlefield Foundation has supported Covarrubias&#8217; research and Benner&#8217;s team of student interns, who provide services based on Covarrubias&#8217; findings. Now the foundation has provided a new gift extending the work over multiple years with the intention of inspiring additional funding.</p>
<h3>&#8220;No one was looking at their cell phones&#8221;</h3>
<p>Janely Cardenas Vargas&#8217;s exposure to the First Generation Initiative began in 2017 with an event at which Shont&#233; Thomas, director of the <a href="https://aarcc.ucsc.edu/">African American Resource and Cultural Center</a>, spoke about challenges she faced when she was an undergraduate.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the director of a program to say, &#8216;Yes, this is my experience, I expect it&#8217;s your experience too. It isn&#8217;t uncommon and we&#8217;re here to help,&#8217;&#8221; said Vargas (Merrill &#8216;20, psychology, Latin American and Latinx studies). &#8220;It broke down the divide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vargas joined the initiative&#8217;s undergraduate student planning committee and presented her own first-generation experience at workshops and panel discussions. These events have been especially notable for audience engagement.</p>
<p>&#8220;At one panel, I took a moment to look down at the audience,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No one was looking at their cell phones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Christina Yu (College Ten &#8216;20, cognitive science), whose First Generation Initiative project is to create <a href="https://firstgen.ucsc.edu/resources/parent-resources/index.html">resources for parents of first-generation college students</a>, noted &#8220;few resources like this exist to support parents and guardians of first-gen college students.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The resources and interviews with current students that were conducted with their parents is a starting point. We had students ask about their experience and share advice. Parents were interviewed in their native languages.&#8221;</p>
<p>The project seeks to help reduce the fears and worries parents and guardians may have about having their child at the university to feel more confident.<br/><br/>Much of the First Generation Initiative&#8217;s work takes these forms, sharing and celebrating the experiences of students and making sure students take advantage of services available on campus.</p>
<h3>Supporting what works</h3>
<p>Brothers Scott and David Littlefield lead the Jacques M. Littlefield Foundation, which was established in their father&#8217;s name. It funds sustainability and first-generation education causes in the Boulder-Denver region and the Bay Area.</p>
<p>&#8220;First-generation students deserve high-quality education to and through college,&#8221; says David Littlefield (Oakes). &#8220;So we&#8217;re happy to support the First Generation Initiative at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221; <br/><br/>Another grantee, Downtown College Prep, a high school in San Jose co-founded by alumna Jennifer Andaluz (Oakes &#8217;94, American Studies), collaborates with ongoing research by Professor Covarrubias and her graduate students. Like Covarrubias&#8217;s work at UC Santa Cruz, her team investigates first-generation students&#8217; experiences to inform how the school serves them.</p>
<p>Researchers work directly alongside teachers and staff. That means the research directly addresses questions relevant to the school and that any findings can be immediately put into practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We work alongside students to identify mechanisms and levers of institutional change,&#8221; Covarrubias said. &#8220;The research is grounded in problems of practice. With research, we can figure out what is working and then make recommendations about how to support those practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://rcovarrubias.sites.ucsc.edu/">Culture and Achievement Collaborative</a>, the student research lab Covarrubias leads, projects begin with first-generation students&#8217; experiences and their questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very empowering process for them to devise questions that matter the most to them and their families and communities,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The research results then inform practices to ensure their success, and other students like them, to and through college.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicole Bergeron advises the Jacques M. Littlefield Foundation on philanthropy matters. She said the First Generation Initiative&#8217;s combination of services and student opportunities based on rigorous research was an important draw.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Jacques M. Littlefield Foundation already supports getting students to college,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We wanted to get students to and through college and ensure that they thrive. The UC Santa Cruz First Generation Initiative really hit all those notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bergeron said a goal of the renewed support was to inspire new grants and gifts for the initiative that can ensure ongoing operations in the indefinite future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our hope is that we can shine a light on the initiative and other funders will come alongside,&#8221; Bergeron said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="22e0119880727017760172d306e967c4"><name>letourneau-biodiversity</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Letourneau's datasets propel research that shows biodiversity improves crop production</title><summary>When Environmental Studies Professor Deborah Letourneau was getting ready to retire, she gave several of her datasets to younger researchers so they could make use of them.

Biodiversity contributes to higher crop yields, they found. (Photos by Matthias Tschumi)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>New study involving more than 100 researchers around the world demonstrates the benefits of biodiversity for humans </article-subhead><article-text><p>When Environmental Studies Professor Deborah Letourneau was getting ready to retire, she gave several of her datasets to younger researchers so they could make use of them. And did they ever.</p>
<p>Letourneau's datasets are part of a large analysis of biodiversity and agriculture that combines data from teams around the world. The results of that collective effort, published in <span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aax0121"><em>Science Advances</em></a></span>, reveal the benefits of biodiversity in agricultural fields: Those fields are better protected from harmful insects, promote greater pollination, and produce higher yields.</p>
<p>"This is one of the fruits of that gesture," Letourneau said of her decision to share her datasets. An entomologist, Letourneau specialized in insect-plant interactions and biological control of crop pests in agriculture before her retirement in 2018.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, approximately 20% of the Earth's cultivated surfaces have become less productive, making the new findings of particular value.</p>
<p>As part of an international research team, ecologists and biologists compared data from about 1,500 agricultural fields around the world, including cornfields in the United States, oilseed rape fields in southern Sweden, coffee plantations in India, mango plantations in South Africa, and cereal crops in the Alps. They analyzed two ecosystem services&#8212;processes regulated by nature that are beneficial and free for humans: pollination provided by wild insects and biological pest control, which is the ability of an environment to use predatory arthropods present in the ecosystem to defend itself from harmful insects.</p>
<p>In heterogeneous landscapes where the variation of crops, hedges, trees and meadows is greater, wild pollinators and "beneficial" insects are more abundant and diversified. Not only do pollination and biological control increase, so does the crop yield.</p>
<p>On the other hand, monocultures are the cause of roughly one-third of the negative effects on pollination that result from landscape simplification, as measured by loss of "pollinator richness." This effect is even greater with the control of harmful insects, where loss of "natural enemy richness" represents 50% of the total consequence of landscape simplification.</p>
<p>"UC researchers&#8217; long legacy of investigating the role of biodiversity in promoting ecosystem services supports both larger studies such as this one, and the rationale for transforming our agricultural practices," said Letourneau.</p>
<p>"Our study shows that biodiversity is essential to ensure the provision of ecosystem services and to maintain a high and stable agricultural production," explained Matteo Dainese, a biologist at Eurac Research and first author of the study. "For example, a farmer can depend less on pesticides to get rid of harmful insects if natural biological controls are increased through higher agricultural biodiversity."</p>
<p>The researchers recommend protecting biodiverse environments and diversifying crops and landscapes as much as possible.</p>
<p>"Under future conditions, with ongoing global change and more frequent extreme climate events, the value of farmland biodiversity ensuring resilience against environmental disturbances will become even more important," said Ingolf Steffan-Dewenter, an animal ecologist in the Department of Animal Ecology and Tropical Biology at the University of W&#252;rzburg. "Our study provides strong empirical support for the potential benefits of new pathways to sustainable agriculture that aim to reconcile the protection of biodiversity and the production of food for increasing human populations."</p>

But to have maximum impact, she knew her images had to be scientifically accurate.</p>
<p>That's why Deck teamed up with Alex Jones, manager of the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve. Together, the artist and scientist collaborated on an interactive depiction of the local Coastal Redwood ecosystem, past, present, and future.</p>
<p>Not all art-science collaborations involve virtual time travel, but they do use visual storytelling to enhance public understanding of scientific concepts. Some fine examples from the UCSC Norris Center<a href="https://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/art/art-science-residency/index.html"> Art-Science Residency</a>, including Deck's project, will be on view at the Museum of Art and History (MAH) on Sunday, Nov. 10 from 10-5 p.m. and at the Norris Center for Natural History on Friday and Saturday, Nov. 15-16 from noon to 5 p.m. All events are free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Viewers will learn about topics like tropical forest restoration in Costa Rica, the life histories of Rainbow Trout and Steelhead, the oral storytelling traditions of Micronesia's outer islands, and gender diversity in marine animals. On display will be artwork that ranges from traditional natural history illustration to stop-motion animation, as well as book projects, infographics, and 3D-printed artificial flowers used in a pollinator experiment.</p>
<p><em><u>Evoking an emotional response</u></em></p>
<p>Deck, like all of the featured artists, immersed herself in scientific journals and learned as much as she could, but Jones was an invaluable collaborator&#8212;even providing the narration in her finished piece.</p>
<p>With Jones's help, Deck (MFA, '19, digital art and new media) was able to paint the lush local Coastal Redwood forests as scientists believe they looked in 1500, when grizzly bears and mountain lions roamed the landscape. She also painted the forest as it stands today, following widespread clear-cutting in the 1800s, and how scientists anticipate it will look in 2100 under two scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: the "best-case" scenario and the "worst-case" scenario. Under both future scenarios, Deck's depictions of the barren landscape in 2100 make clear the sad fate of Coastal Redwoods: "If we don't have coastal fog, they're not going to make it," she said.</p>
<p>Deck "layered" her paintings with interactive, computer graphics that show temperature, biodiversity, fire frequency, and carbon dioxide parts-per-million over time. Viewers navigate across the images, hovering to learn more about each topic.</p>
<p>"It was an ambitious idea," said Deck. "Nobody's doing this. But this is why I make art. Pictures have so much potential to really show us things and to elicit an emotional response to climate change."</p>
<p><em><u>"These collaborations get us out of our silos"</u></em></p>
<p>Deck's project, and the others on display as part of the "<a href="https://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/events/">Uniting Art and Science to Ignite Inquiry</a>" exhibit, highlight the value of pairing artists and scientists. Some projects, like Deck's rendering of a future landscape, simply wouldn't be possible unless an artist is involved, but the benefits run both ways, according to Karen Holl, faculty director of the Norris Center.</p>
<p>"For faculty and graduate student scientists, these collaborations get us out of our silos and help us think differently and communicate in more creative ways," said Holl. "For student artists, this residency gives them a professional training opportunity and a chance to work with researchers as clients."</p>
<p>Now in its third year, the residency has produced illustrations that have been published in textbooks and scholarly articles and used in public talks.</p>
<p>The residency, which is unique in the UC system and rare in higher education generally, sponsors six to eight projects per year, with faculty and graduate student scientists proposing projects, according to Juniper Harrower, coordinator of the program. The Norris Center reaches out to student artists, typically attracting 30 or more applications.</p>
<p>"This art-science residency gives scientists a chance to step outside their science-speak without losing the depth, complexity, and rigor of their work," said Harrower (PhD, '19, environmental studies), who participated as a graduate student before becoming coordinator. "They get to see their life's work come to life. And artists bring their expertise, which is really empowering for students."</p>
<p><em><u>A Joshua Tree Love Story</u></em></p>
<p>Harrower, who has a professional background as both a scientist and an artist, created a stop-motion animated film that presents her work on Joshua Tree ecology through the lens of her experience as a researcher working in the field. She collaborated with artists Grace Ackles (Porter College '18, BA art; BA anthropology) and Lauren Benzaquen (MFA, '19, digital art and new media) to tell the story of how climate change might impact the trees' symbiotic relationship with pollinating moths and root fungi. The biographical narrative of "A Joshua Tree Love Story" makes the information readily accessible to audiences.</p>
<p>"I'd always dreamed of doing stop-motion animation and thought I might make it as part of my Ph.D. dissertation," recalled Harrower. "I wanted to use it as a storytelling tool."</p>
<p>Her first project, a two-minute animation about how tiny moths pollinate the trees, led to an artist-in-residence position at Joshua Tree National Park with<a href="http://www.iswoopparks.com/"> Interpreters and Scientists Working On Our Parks</a> (iSWOOP) and the inspiration to make a new film that incorporates a more human narrative into the story.</p>
<p>"People told me that I should be part of the story, because I was pregnant or carrying my baby on my back during my field research and the residency," said Harrower. That multi-generational element of the story highlights the plight of the trees, all of which could be gone within 100 years because of climate change, she said.</p>
<p>"That emotional, social narrative allows people to connect on a different level," said Harrower. "It still has all the science, but it is part of a bigger narrative."</p>
<p>Working with Ackles and Benzaquen was empowering for Harrower, too, as the artists shared their talents. "We workshopped what's possible, how to tell the story and show the science," she said. "The animators had the background to think about what was possible, and to explore how to communicate in metaphorical and engaging ways."</p>

<p>Created by New Orleans-based artist Jackie Sumell, the project revolves around a sculpture built by following the blueprint of a standard U.S. solitary confinement cell. This small 6&#8217; x 9&#8217; prison cell will sit on campus atop a slope near the Baskin Art Studios that looks out on Monterey Bay.&#160;</p>
<p>Over the next year, a garden of flowers and vegetables will grow around the cell, designed by Tim Young, who is currently incarcerated in San Quentin.</p>
<p>Young will&#160;communicate by letters and drawings with students and volunteers who will plant and tend the garden as his proxies. The idea is to transform the image of confinement into a space of nourishment and hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the United Nations has condemned the practice of solitary confinement as torture, there are an estimated 61,000 people held in isolation for 22 to 24 hours each day in U.S. prisons,&#8221; said Sumell. &#8220;<em>Solitary Garden</em>&#160;is a call to end this appalling practice."</p>
<p>The process of collaboratively nurturing the garden and watching the the plants surround the prison cell offers both participants and viewers the opportunity to, as Sumell puts it, imagine a landscape without prisons.</p>
<p><strong>The opening of <em>Solitary Garden</em></strong> marks the launch of 18-months of programming and exhibitions organized by the Institute of the Arts and Sciences (IAS) called <em>Barring Freedom</em>. With exhibitions, speaking events, film screenings, and a symposium in Fall 2020, <em>Barring Freedom</em> will bring together some of the most important artists, scholars, and activists around the complex issues of policing, surveillance, imprisonment, and detention that bar millions of people from freedom in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to bring <em>Solitary Garden</em> to Santa Cruz because the project intersects with the long history of teaching and activism around mass incarceration, prisons, and solitary confinement on this campus,&#8221; noted Rachel Nelson, interim director of the IAS.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the abolitionist teaching, research, and activism of Angela Davis, history of consciousness professor emerita, to the studies and legal testimonies of psychology professor Craig Haney about the effects of solitary confinement, this art project is deeply embedded in the concerns of the faculty and students at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p><strong>A multimedia artist and activist</strong>, Sumell has exhibited her work throughout the United States and Europe. An ardent public speaker, she has also lectured in colleges and universities around the country and was a keynote speaker for the National Prisoner Advocacy Conference in 2014.</p>
<p>Her art is driven by a deep commitment to addressing the abuses of&#160;the American criminal justice system, as exemplified by her 12-year collaborative project with the late Herman Wallace, one of the former Angola 3 prisoners, titled T<em>he House That Herman Built</em>. The project is the subject of a critically acclaimed documentary film,<em>&#160;Herman's House</em>, that aired on PBS. Sumell began the <em>Solitary Garden </em>project to honor the legacy of Wallace, who was held in solitary confinement for more than 40 years.</p>
<p>&#160;__________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The<em><strong> Solitary Garden</strong></em> public sculpture and garden project will run on campus from Nov. 5, 2019, to Dec. 6, 2020. The opening reception takes place Nov. 5, at the Baskin Arts Studios quad, beginning at 5:30 p.m. Artist Jackie Sumell will also give an artist talk on Nov. 5 at UCSC&#8217;s Digital Arts Research Center (108), beginning at 7 p.m. Sumell will be joined by UCSC feminist studies professor Gina Dent in conversation following her talk. Admission is free and open to the public. Visit the <strong><em><a href="https://ias.ucsc.edu/">Institute of the Arts and Sciences</a></em></strong> web site for more information.</p>

Changes made during Open Enrollment become effective Jan. 1, 2020. &#160;<br/><br/>Open Enrollment is the annual period during which you can take charge of your benefits. Just as your life goes through changes, your health and welfare needs evolve as well. This is why we urge you during this time to review the OE information and consider all of your available choices, assess your needs, and decide if you will make any adjustments. If you decide that your health and welfare benefits should remain unchanged, generally, you do not need to take action during Open Enrollment. However, if you want to continue participation in Health and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts, re-enrollment is required annually during open enrollment.<br/><br/><strong>Open Enrollment Fair on Nov. 5</strong><br/>The campus Benefits Office will be hosting an Open Enrollment Fair providing the UCSC community the opportunity to connect directly with representatives from the health and welfare benefit plans.The UCSC Open Enrollment Fair is 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.&#160;Nov. 5 at the Cowell Ranch Hay Barn.

<p>2020 employee medical premium cost shares for represented employees may differ from the rates published in the OE booklet. For your 2020 rates, log into&#160;<a href="https://atyourserviceonline.ucop.edu/ayso/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AYSO</a>.<br/><br/><strong>Highlights of Changes</strong><br/>Despite rising health care costs, UC continues to manage medical plan costs for employees and UC while maintaining quality care. For 2020, some plans will see premium decreases and some plans have increases to medical plan premiums for faculty and staff.&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>UC&#8217;s medical premium changes for faculty and staff are moderate, with decreases for some members. The changes to employee nets for single coverage range from a monthly decrease of $12 to an increase of $16, depending on the plan and dependent coverage.&#160;</li>
<li>UC Care, UC Health Savings Plan and Core medical plans will transition from the current Anthem National Drug list to the Anthem Essential Drug list, which will affect some members&#8217; pharmaceutical copays. This change has allowed UC to help control the plans&#8217; costs for 2020. Most members will see no changes to their prescription costs. However, some drugs will move to a tier with a higher co-pay.

Reports may also be made by utilizing one of the several "blue light," emergency or elevator phones located throughout campus.&#8232;<br/> &#8226; Suspicious people or activity should be reported to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department by calling 911, when it is safe to do so.&#8232;<br/> &#8226; Be alert to your surroundings. Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims. Attempt to keep a safe distance from strangers.&#8232;<br/> &#8226; Trust your instincts.

<p dir="ltr"><span>The university is committed to ensuring that all people may exercise the constitutionally protected rights of free expression, speech, and assembly. The right of free speech in a university includes the right to acts of peaceful dissent, protests in peaceable assembly, and orderly demonstrations which include picketing.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It is important to know that these rights are subject to restrictions based on time, place, and manner rules. For example, UC policy does not allow free expression to disrupt the regular and essential operations of the university, to significantly infringe on the rights of others, or to block or impede ingress to or egress from the campus or buildings. When free expression disrupts our ability to offer classes, administer exams, carry on research, or run the university in general&#8212;or when it violates university policy or the law in any way&#8212;then it may be subject to disciplinary consequences.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Additionally, please remember that no employee is ever obligated to strike. Unions are legally prohibited from threatening or coercing members in other ways to keep them from coming to work. Staff members should remain in contact with their supervisors and managers to discuss their schedules and work locations.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you feel you are being threatened, harassed, intimidated about crossing the picket line, or are prevented from working by picketers or striking employees, please immediately notify your supervisor and your campus employee and labor relations office. In cases of emergency, please dial 9-1-1.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Though we do not know how these strike activities will impact the operation of our campus, we are working to do everything we can to ensure continued operations. TAPS Transit Operations will give highest priority to providing Disability Van Service (DVS) clients transport between on-campus locations while suspending the Bike Shuttle and regular Loop and Upper Campus shuttle services. Santa Cruz Metro buses typically do not enter campus during strikes; however, they generally drop off and pick up riders at the base of campus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We anticipate that there will be dining options open during the strike; however, dining option hours will be limited from 7 a.m to 8 p.m and types of food available will be limited as well. We also anticipate that all cafes and restaurants operated by UC Santa Cruz Dining may be closed. Please check the Dining and campus websites for updates.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We also anticipate that the Student Health Services will be open during the strike, but may have limited services. The health center recommends that students proactively take care of any immediate health care needs prior to the strike.&#160; Students can also access care by using the Anthem Live Health Online Service at <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livehealthonline.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1573085406810000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2L__e9UB2h99wFLmau-itY2rD3A" href="https://www.livehealthonline.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.livehealthonline.<wbr/>com/</a>&#160;&#160;</span></p>
