<p>State lawmakers provided new funding to the University of California to advance faculty diversity. Both campus projects received funding from UCOP in September.</p>
<p>&#8220;The campus is grateful to the Office of the President for providing funding for these innovative projects that help us think about additional aspects of faculty diversity and inclusion,&#8221; said Herbert Lee, vice provost for Academic Affairs and the campus diversity officer for faculty.</p>
<h3>Pilot program puts diversity at the forefront of searches</h3>
<p>Roughly a third of the faculty recruitments in the coming year will put contributions to diversity, equity, and inclusion at the forefront.</p>
<p>The campus expects to run about 30 faculty recruitments in the coming year. In the recruitments that are part of the pilot program, search committees will first review and assess candidates&#8217; statements on contributions to diversity, equity, and inclusion before determining whether to evaluate the rest of the application materials. The statements will also be redacted to reduce potential impact of implicit bias.</p>
<p>Candidates who do advance will be evaluated on the whole of their application. The UC Santa Cruz program is based on similar successful efforts at UC Berkeley and UC Davis. Searches that are not part of the pilot program will continue to be run under existing campus practices, which includes asking candidates to submit a statement about their contributions to diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>
<p>Fifteen percent of UC Santa Cruz faculty members identify as underrepresented minorities. While that&#8217;s one of the highest percentages in the system, Lee said the campus must continue to increase faculty diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faculty members are mentors and sources of inspiration for our students,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;It&#8217;s critical that our faculty better reflect the great diversity of our student body and arrive ready to help make our campus even more inclusive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campus is also encouraging search committees to ask candidates to give a talk on contributions to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and how they would work to further it at UC Santa Cruz if they were hired.</p>
<p>As part of the grant, the campus will host a workshop in winter quarter on faculty research into best practices for inclusive hiring.</p>
<p>A group of new faculty members will be recruited to launch a new global and community health program, an interdisciplinary collaboration between the divisions of Social Sciences and Physical and Biological Sciences. The faculty in the sciences will focus on parasitic and infectious diseases, the microbiome, structural biology, and stem cells, though all candidates who can contribute to global and community health are encouraged to apply. The faculty members in Social Sciences will focus on social justice and health metrics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the strength of our research on human health, tremendous student interest in courses on the topic, and our long standing commitment to progress on social justice, global and community health seemed like a natural area of growth for the campus, and one where we should make every possible effort to recruit faculty who reflect the diversity of the state and nation,&#8221; Koch said.</p>
<p>Other recruitments will be for professors in environmental art (Arts Division), signals and systems, deep learning, and serious games (Jack Baskin School of Engineering).</p>
<p>The $497,000 grant will help enable the campus to make a temporary hire who will assist with the additional work required to do the first screening with only the contributions to diversity statements. The funding will also be used to help advertise searches, support recruitment, support diversity/inclusion efforts of the recruited faculty, and supplement faculty startup packages.</p>
<h3>Rethinking faculty leadership opportunities</h3>
<p>In an effort to develop strategies to support faculty leadership, a team of researchers will interview and survey campus professors, and study national leadership programs. The goal is to redefine the meaning of leadership to be more inclusive of existing practices and efforts of historically marginalized faculty.</p>
<p>Associate Professor of Psychology Rebecca Covarrubias is leading the project with contributions from Jody Greene, associate vice provost for Teaching and Learning and professor of literature, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, and Katherine Quinteros, a graduate student in psychology.</p>
<p>Universities thrive from the leadership, both formal and informal, of faculty from underrepresented groups, Covarrubias said. However, many of these faculty might be reluctant to take on formal leadership appointments for a host of reasons. These might range from recognizing that these efforts might be dismissed or not valued to experiencing difficulty in balancing formal roles with heavy responsibilities for less-visible labor, such as mentoring and advising students.</p>
<p>This project provides an opportunity to rethink how we view faculty leadership, Covarrubias said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hope is to work with faculty to collectively highlight the ways in which they already engage in transformative leadership at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The project calls for informing a leadership model that better acknowledges, affirms, and bolsters the cultural skills, assets, values and knowledge of all of its faculty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers plan to share all research findings and other insights in summer 2020 with fellow faculty members and campus leaders as well as at national conferences and in peer-reviewed publications.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="29994e8d80727017760172d314158c33"><name>morton-marcus-poetry-reading</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Award-winning poet Gary Soto to read at 10th annual Morton Marcus memorial event</title><summary>Award-winning poet and novelist Gary Soto will be the featured guest at the 10th annual Morton Marcus Poetry Reading, Thursday, November 7, at 7 p.m. in the UCSC Music Recital Hall.  </summary><keywords>poetry events, ucsc poetry, gary soto, morton marcus, santa cruz poetry</keywords><start-date>1572656700000</start-date><display-name>Morton Marcus Poetry Reading</display-name><path>/2019/11/morton-marcus-poetry-reading</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/11/morton-marcus-poetry-reading</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1572655943279</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1572657791481</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/11/images/morton-marcus-banner-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/11/images/morton-marcus-banner-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>morton-marcus-banner-500.jpg</name><display-name>morton-marcus-banner-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>142573</file-size><width>500</width><height>281</height></image><image-alt>ucsc morton marcus poetry reading banner</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/11/images/morton-marcus-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/11/images/morton-marcus-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>morton-marcus-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>morton-marcus-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25636</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>ucsc morton marcus poetry reading banner</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Award-winning poet and novelist<span>&#160;</span><strong>Gary Soto </strong>will be the featured guest at the 10th<sup> </sup>annual<span>&#160;</span><strong>Morton Marcus Poetry Reading</strong>, Thursday, November 7, at 7 p.m. in the UC Santa Cruz Music Recital Hall. &#160;</p>
<p>The event is held each year to honor poet, teacher, film critic, and Santa Cruz cultural icon Morton Marcus (1936-2009).</p>
<p>It was created to continue Marcus&#8217;s tradition of bringing acclaimed poets to Santa Cruz County, to acknowledge the significant role poetry has played in the community's history, and to help preserve poetry's influence in the county's culture.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz humanities lecturer and alumnus Gary Young--Santa Cruz's first ever poet laureate--will emcee the program and present a&#160;$1,000 prize to the winner of the annual Morton Marcus Poetry Contest.</p>
<p>One of today's most celebrated Chicano writers, Soto has published more than 40 books for children, young adults and adults, including&#160;<em>Too Many Tamales, Chato&#8217;s Kitchen, Baseball in April</em>,&#160;<em>Buried Onions&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>The Elements of San Joaquin</em>.</p>
<p>He is also the author of&#160;<em>In and Out of Shadows,&#160;</em>a musical about undocumented youth and, most recently,&#160;<em>The Afterlife</em>, a one-act play about teen murder and teen suicide</p>
<p>Soto<span>&#160;was&#160;</span>nominated<span>&#160;for the&#160;</span>1978 Pulitzer Prize<span>&#160;for <em>The Tale of Sunlight</em>, his second collection of poems. His first poetry collection, <em>The Elements of San Joaquin</em>, received the 1976 United States&#160;Award from the International Poetry Forum. And his 1995 collection,<em> New and Selected Poems, </em>was a finalist for both the National Book Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Award. </span></p>
<p>Soto&#8217;s poem &#8220;Oranges&#8221; has the distinction of being the most anthologized poem in contemporary literature. His books have sold four million copies nationally and have been translated into French, Japanese, Italian, Korean, and Spanish.</p>
<p>A recipient of the Discovery/The Nation Prize and the California Library Association's John and Patricia Beatty Award, Soto has also received multiple fellowships from both the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation.</p>
<p>In 1995, he was selected <em>NBC's Person of the Week</em> for his work with young people. Soto has also been honored with the Human and Civil Rights Award from the American Education Association, the Literature Award from the Hispanic Heritage Foundation, and the PEN Center West Book Award for his young-adult short story collection, <em>Petty Crimes</em>.</p>
<p>A book signing and reception will follow the reading. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the program begins at 7 p.m. Admission is free and open to the public. <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=3777&amp;cid=7665">RSVP</a> is requested.</p>

If you do not utilize payroll deduction for any of these items, or do not plan on beginning to do so this calendar year, you may disregard this message.<br/><br/>Due to the integration of UCPath, TAPS will not be able to process any changes to payroll deductions during the month of December, 2019. Any changes to your parking permit, bus pass or vanpool payroll deduction for the remainder of 2019 must be submitted by November 22, 2019.&#160;<br/><br/>Please read below for the changes to parking permit, bus pass and vanpool payroll deductions necessitated by the transition to UCPath:<br/><br/><strong>Payroll Deduction:&#160;</strong><br/>If you are eligible for, and choose to use payroll deduction it will continue until and unless you are separated from the University or request your payroll deductions be stopped when you determine that you no longer need a parking permit, bus pass or vanpool. Additionally, you must return your permit or bus pass to the Permit Sales Office. <strong>Your payroll deduction will accrue until your permit or bus pass is returned to the TAPS Permit Sales Office. Any charges that accrue due to the permit or bus pass not being returned remain the responsibility of the employee.</strong> <strong>There will be no refunds of accrued fees.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Parking Permits:</strong><br/>If you have an &#8220;Annual A&#8221; parking permit (including carpools) and have elected to use payroll deduction, your permit will be converted to a &#8220;Multi-Year A&#8221; parking permit. You must exchange your &#8220;Annual A&#8221; permit for a &#8220;Multi-Year A&#8221; permit prior to June 30, 2020, or return the permit to stop deductions. Displaying an expired permit may result in citation, even as payroll deductions continue. You may exchange an &#8220;Annual A&#8221; permit for a &#8220;Multi-Year A&#8221; permit beginning in the Spring Quarter.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Annual Bus Passes:</strong><br/>Your payroll deduction will continue until you request a stop to it, and your bus pass will need to be replaced annually. <strong>You must return your bus pass to the TAPS Permit Sales Office for your payroll deductions to stop.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Vanpool:</strong><br/>Your vanpool payroll deductions will not be affected by the conversion to UCPath. However, if you would like to join or leave a vanpool, <strong>you must request the change before November 22, 2019 or after January 1, 2020</strong>.

According to Emily Chang's book <em>Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys' Club of Silicon Valley</em>, nearly 40% of computer science degrees in 1984 were earned by women, compared to just 22% today.</p>
<p>With so few women in tech and engineering, it can be difficult for women to see themselves in these careers, which only perpetuates the gender gap. In an effort to encourage more women to enter the field, the national nonprofit <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a> (GWC) has been working to change the collective image of what a computer scientist or engineer looks like, providing models of female computer scientists through books, speakers, and programs that teach girls practical computing skills.</p>
<p>GWC&#8217;s main focus has been on high-school and middle-school girls, but as an estimated 30,000 of its programs&#8217; 185,000 alumni are reaching college age, the organization has begun expanding its reach. Last year, GWC announced it was launching a new College Loops program, and students at UC Santa Cruz were quick to establish their own branch. Harshitha Arul Murugan, current president of the UCSC branch, has some ambitious plans for how to encourage retention of women in tech on campus.</p>
<p><strong>High school coder to college computer science major</strong></p>
<p>Arul Murugan is herself an alumna of a high school Girls Who Code program. She spent seven weeks interning with a group of 30 girls at a tech company in Sunnyvale. Before entering the program at the end of her junior year, she had decided not to go into computer science because she had had negative experiences in previous coding classes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both of my parents work in the tech industry, but at first I did not want to go into it because I took a couple of coding classes, and there were only two girls and eight boys,&#8221; she explains. &#8220;If the boys finished anything faster they would say, &#8216;Oh, it is because we are boys, we are good at this naturally.&#8217; It was really discouraging... I was determined to go into business instead, but then I got involved with Girls Who Code and gave computer science one last try. It was so nice being in a room full of girls, not being embarrassed to ask any questions. It was great, and that is actually what got me back into the computer science major.&#8221;</p>
<p>After her internship, Arul Murugan formed a GWC club at her high school. She says she is even more excited about the college version of the club because of the opportunity it provides for practical career training and more personal mentorship.</p>
<p>Arul Murugan experienced this type of mentorship first-hand from the UCSC club&#8217;s former president, Victoria Tran, who started the campus's first college loop last year before graduating and starting her career at eBay. Arul Murugan says Tran helped her and other group members navigate issues such as imposter syndrome, a feeling among some students and professionals characterized by thoughts that one is an &#8220;imposter&#8221; and does not really belong in a particular field. Impostor syndrome can affect people of all genders, but Arul Murugan suspects that female students might feel it more strongly because they have fewer models of computer scientists or engineers who look like them.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I came to UCSC, I had a group of friends who were mostly boys, and sometimes I just didn&#8217;t feel comfortable sharing things like imposter syndrome with them because most guys don&#8217;t even know what that is,&#8221; Arul Murugan notes. &#8220;But when I joined GWC in winter quarter, Victoria was talking about it and encouraging us through it. Having a kind of older sister telling you, &#8216;Yeah, you&#8217;ve got this, if I can get through this you can get through this,&#8217; that really helped me a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Big plans for the 2019-20 academic year</strong></p>
<p>This year, Arul Murugan hopes to foster the type of mentorship she found so helpful last year by using GWC to create a kind of &#8220;big sister&#8221; program that pairs freshmen and sophomores with juniors and seniors for one-on-one mentoring to encourage the more junior students to stay in engineering majors.</p>
<p>&#8220;A couple of my friends wanted to do computer science and computer engineering, but they didn&#8217;t feel accepted and wanted to drop out of the major,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I want to encourage people to stay in the major and see how awesome it is. We can make a huge impact on the field as women because there aren&#8217;t that many women at the table, and we bring a new perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>The national organization of Girls Who Code provides curriculum for the college loops, but it also allows college groups more freedom than the programs for younger girls. Arul Murugan plans to include time during club meetings for students to learn and practice skills they will need for technical interviews and building their future careers. Most importantly, however, she wants to provide a space for women to discuss questions, concerns, and even their failures with one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really want to create a safe space where we could discuss things that we couldn&#8217;t discuss outside,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>In addition to running club meetings, Arul Murugan is also working toward creating the first annual Baskin Engineering Women&#8217;s Graduation Banquet to celebrate the accomplishments of women who stick with engineering majors. Abigail Kaun, executive adviser to the dean of the Baskin School of Engineering, is helping the group obtain sponsors for the banquet. Kaun says that student groups like Girls Who Code can help female students overcome the stereotype threat and imposter syndrome that frequently discourage women from continuing in tech fields.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Girls Who Code has the potential to be extremely effective in building confidence and certainly in building community,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Finding community can be a problem if your group is 22 percent of the population, but Girls Who Code is building a community of colleagues that they can build on and learn from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arul Murugan also stressed how important community is for women in STEM, and urges other women to join clubs in which they can feel less isolated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would encourage the incoming class of female engineers to join clubs like Society of Women Engineers, AMC-W, and Girls Who Code to build a strong network of women around them whom they can go to for help,&#8221; she says. &#8220;That is what has helped me get through high school and college, and I really want incoming students to find a strong group of women to help them as well.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3862504280727017760172d3cf87ebc4"><name>data-security-compliance-and-cruz-buy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Data Security Compliance and CruzBuy</title><summary>We write to update you on new Data Security and Privacy requirements when requesting services from Suppliers who will have access to UCSC data or systems.

<p>The designation as AMS Fellow honors members of the society who have made outstanding contributions to mathematics and to the profession. Ginzburg was recognized "for contributions to Hamiltonian dynamical systems and symplectic topology and in particular studies into the existence and non-existence of periodic orbits."</p>
<p>Symplectic geometry is the geometry underlying classical mechanics and is also important to quantum mechanics and low-dimensional topology. Hamiltonian systems are the natural dynamical systems arising in symplectic geometry. Ginzburg's recent work has focused on the problem of existence of periodic orbits of Hamiltonian systems and related questions. His research has deepened understanding of connections between symplectic topology and Hamiltonian dynamics.</p>
<p>Ginzburg earned his Ph.D. in mathematics at UC Berkeley and joined the UCSC faculty in 1996. He received the Concours Annuel Prize from the Royal Academy of Belgium in 2016.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3dd3cc0780727017760172d3911b2091"><name>strike-updates</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Strike activities have concluded</title><summary>The University of California has been informed that there will be a labor strike on all of its campuses and medical centers on Wednesday, Nov. 13, beginning at midnight and going through 11:59 p.m. The strike will include employees represented by AFSCME Service (SX), Patient Care Technical (EX), and Skilled Trades (K7).

<h3>Wednesday, Nov. 13</h3>
<p><strong>5:52 p.m. &#8212;</strong>&#160;Today&#8217;s labor action at the base of our residential campus by AFSCME workers and their supporters has concluded.<br/><br/>The strike officially ends at 11:59 p.m. tonight (Wednesday).<br/><br/>Metro service, which had been limited to buses stopping at the base of campus, has resumed on-campus operations. Campus will return to regularly scheduled operations Thursday morning, with all dining halls operating on their published schedules and campus shuttles resuming their scheduled routes.<br/><br/>Today&#8217;s labor action unfolded peacefully for striking workers and their supporters, as well as for those entering and exiting campus. We appreciate everyone&#8217;s patience and cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>4:23 p.m.</strong> &#8212; Strike activity continues. The campus remains open with access at both entrances.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>2:30 p.m. &#8212;</strong>&#160;The residential campus remains open with strike activity continuing at the main entrance.&#160;</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The University of California has been informed that there will be a labor strike on all of its campuses and medical centers on Wednesday, Nov. 13, beginning at midnight and going through 11:59 p.m. The strike will include employees represented by AFSCME Service (SX), Patient Care Technical (EX), and Skilled Trades (K7). In advance of this scheduled strike activity, we write to share information and resources.</p>
<p>The university is committed to ensuring that all people may exercise the constitutionally protected rights of free expression, speech, and assembly. The right of free speech in a university includes the right to acts of peaceful dissent, protests in peaceable assembly, and orderly demonstrations which include picketing.</p>
<p>It is important to know that these rights are subject to restrictions based on time, place, and manner rules. For example, UC policy does not allow free expression to disrupt the regular and essential operations of the university, to significantly infringe on the rights of others, or to block or impede ingress to or egress from the campus or buildings. When free expression disrupts our ability to offer classes, administer exams, carry on research, or run the university in general&#8212;or when it violates university policy or the law in any way&#8212;then it may be subject to disciplinary consequences.</p>
<p>Additionally, please remember that no employee is ever obligated to strike. Unions are legally prohibited from threatening or coercing members in other ways to keep them from coming to work. Staff members should remain in contact with their supervisors and managers to discuss their schedules and work locations.</p>
<p>If you feel you are being threatened, harassed, intimidated about crossing the picket line, or are prevented from working by picketers or striking employees, please immediately notify your supervisor and your campus employee and labor relations office. In cases of emergency, please dial 9-1-1.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If you have questions about campus operations on strike days, information will be posted on a special website: http://www.ucsc.edu/status, recorded on the campus communication hotline (459-INFO), provided to KZSC Radio (88.1 FM) for broadcast, and shared via the campus Twitter account (https://twitter.com/ucsc). If access to the campus is not possible, further instructions to the campus community will be posted via these channels.</p>

<li>Inform a senior director of college student life, associate director of college student life, coordinator of residential education (CRE) supervisor, dean, or provost so they can assess whether the graffiti and/or the fliers were posted in accordance with campus posting policies (all unauthorized postings, regardless of content, are removed).</li>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, has joined the Association of American Universities, an achievement that underscores the impact and quality of the campus&#8217;s research and graduate and undergraduate education. Membership in the AAU provides UC Santa Cruz greater opportunity to shape and advocate for the future of higher education.</p>
<p>The association, founded in 1900, has 65 members, including six other UCs, flagship public universities such as Ohio State University, land-grant universities like Purdue University, and private institutions, such as Harvard. This is the first time the association has invited new members since 2012.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz has long been known for the pioneering and transformational research of its faculty, students and staff across and between disciplines. Election to the AAU is a formal acknowledgment of the power that comes from applying diverse perspectives to the world&#8217;s biggest challenges&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;Our research and commitment to student success are united and animated by our social justice mission and I am proud that AAU membership follows our recent recognition for contributions to student social mobility. That this is an honor conferred by our peers makes it especially rewarding.&#8221;</p>
<p>In deciding whether to invite a university to join, the association evaluates a range of indicators, such as research funding, faculty awards and honors, citations, doctoral education, undergraduate education and more. Dartmouth College and the University of Utah are being welcomed to the AAU along with UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;AAU&#8217;s membership is limited to institutions at the forefront of scientific inquiry and educational excellence,&#8221; said AAU President Mary Sue Coleman. &#8220;These world-class institutions are a welcome addition, and we look forward to working with them as we continue to shape policy for higher education, science, and innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is known for radical excellence in groundbreaking research and creative scholarship that challenges conventional thinking. The strong commitment to progressive higher education, social justice, and sustainability pervades the academic work of the campus and daily life.</p>
<p>Among its many high impact accomplishments, the campus published online the &#64257;rst working draft of the human genome and made key contributions to the discovery of the Higgs Boson. The agroecology program remains a leader in the organic food movement, and every summer, hundreds of people visit the residential campus for the Dickens Universe.</p>
<p>Eleven faculty members are members of the National Academy of Sciences, 24 are members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and 35 have been elected as fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
<p>The high impact research conducted at UC Santa Cruz complements the campus&#8217;s guiding commitment to access and student success. U.S. News and World Report ranks UC Santa Cruz No. 2 among universities in the nation for promoting social mobility. The ranking is determined by how well a university enrolls and graduates low-income students.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was designated a Hispanic-Serving Institution in 2015 and since then has worked to develop programs to support students from all backgrounds and has been awarded more than $11 million in federal grants that support student success and equity initiatives.</p>
<p>The campus continues to work hard to ensure equitable access to quality higher education. Roughly a third of UC Santa Cruz undergraduates will be among the first in their families to earn a four-year degree.</p>
<p>In 2018-19, UC Santa Cruz secured more than $165 million in research funding and more than half a billion dollars over the past five years. More than 200 students earned doctorates in the arts, engineering, humanities, physical and biological sciences, and social sciences in the previous academic year.</p>
<p>Securing membership in the AAU was a long-term goal for Chancellor Emeritus George Blumenthal, who stepped down in June. Under Blumenthal, the campus established 16 new endowed faculty chairs during its comprehensive fundraising campaign. Endowed chairs are essential to recruiting and retaining the best faculty members, and providing them with the resources and freedom to test new ideas, Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>"For well over a decade, UC Santa Cruz has aspired to have its outstanding work recognized through an invitation to join the AAU,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;I am so pleased and excited by today's news, which recognized that the quality of our campus academic activities places us among the nation's elite universities."</p>
<p>AAU&#8217;s 65 research universities transform lives through education, research, and innovation. The association notes that the universities earn the majority of competitively awarded federal funding for academic research and are educating tomorrow&#8217;s visionary leaders and global citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;This well-deserved recognition underscores UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s standing as a premier research institution, furthering education, advancing science, and contributing to American society and beyond,&#8221; said UC President Janet Napolitano. &#8220;With Santa Cruz&#8217;s election, seven of the 65 AAU universities are UC &#8211; an unparalleled distinction in which all Californians can take extraordinary pride.&#8221;</p>
<p>Along with UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz is the youngest university to gain admittance to the AAU. This early invitation recognizes the radical excellence of a new kind of university serving a new generation of students.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="42d0aba380727017760172d39fa1cbb2"><name>ucsc-earns-prestigious-honor-aau-membership</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz earns prestigious honor — membership in AAU</title><summary>While our community is humble, we know the incredible impact we’ve had in our relatively short history.

<p>This achievement is an inflection point for our campus. It shines a spotlight on the across-the-board strength of our research work as well as our high-quality graduate and undergraduate instruction. Campuses are not elected for being strong in one field. Eleven UCSC faculty are members of the National Academy of Sciences, two dozen are members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, while 35 have been elected as fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The innovative and collaborative work of so many made this honor possible. Election to the AAU is a formal acknowledgment of the power that comes from applying diverse perspectives to the world&#8217;s biggest challenges. I could not be more proud or grateful for the work of Slugs past and present.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is the seventh University of California campus to earn this accolade. The association, founded in 1900, has just 65 members, a powerhouse collection of public research universities and private institutions.&#160;</p>
<p>We have always been a strong, research-focused university, but one with an uncommon emphasis on undergraduate instruction and an unwavering belief in social equity and justice. That is not a common combination in higher education, but it is key to our strength.</p>
<p>Our success is not possible without our full community and the participation of students, staff, and faculty from all backgrounds. It is particularly gratifying that our admission to the AAU comes on the heels of being ranked No. 2 in the nation for social mobility. We are working hard to better serve a new generation of students and to ensure equitable access to quality higher education. These values help define us on the national stage. We will have the opportunity to further advocate for innovation and inclusivity in higher education policy as we join the pre-eminent national organization of research institutions.</p>
<p>I am so proud to serve a university that measures elite status by how wide we can open our doors. I am thrilled to announce this honor &#8212; and to know UC Santa Cruz will now have a bigger impact in helping to define the future of higher education.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this message stated that the University of California, which has seven campuses in the AAU, was the only university system to have more than one campus in the association. The State University of New York has two campuses represented.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Campus Community</audience><admin>Cynthia Larive, UC Santa Cruz Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="433a367c80727017760172d3fa9a59bb"><name>startup-santa-cruz</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biotech blooms on Santa Cruz’s westside</title><summary>The biotech boom on the westside of Santa Cruz is the culmination of all the pieces falling into place—brilliant and driven graduate alumni and faculty members who are eager to make people’s lives better, vacant buildings in need of a new purpose, and a university partnering with the community to foster entrepreneurs. &#13;

The westside of Santa Cruz, once home to factories producing gum, tea, and computer chips, is transforming into a biotechnology hub.</p>
<p>Some of the latest startups, powered by the research strength of UC Santa Cruz, are focused on cracking some of the world&#8217;s most difficult problems&#8212;figuring out a better way to pack products for shipment across the world, creating new ways to fight infection to reduce the use of antibiotics, and developing innovative drugs to help combat cancer.</p>
<p>Driving along the westside, the transformation can be seen in by the appearance of sleek electric vehicles parked around old warehouses and the sudden blossoming of chic coffee houses, high-end breweries and a New Leaf grocery store. Lycra-clad joggers get in some miles during their lunch breaks.</p>
<p>The biotech boom is the culmination of all the pieces falling into place&#8212;brilliant and driven graduate alumni and faculty members who are eager to make people&#8217;s lives better, vacant buildings in need of a new purpose, and a university partnering with the community to foster entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to see the benefits of entrepreneurship and innovation, and the impact this has on an area so close to home,&#8221; Baskin School of Engineering Dean Alexander Wolf said. &#8220;What&#8217;s happening is a virtuous cycle: Our researchers and graduates see their peers building successful companies &#8212; companies that also benefit the community &#8212; and they&#8217;re inspired to build their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cruz Foam is developing sustainable, biodegradable foam to help end plastic pollution. Founded by Marco Rolandi, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering, researcher Xiaolin Zhang, and John Felts, who studied electrical engineering as a UC Santa Cruz graduate student, the company got its start in building a better surfboard&#8212;one that didn&#8217;t rely on plastics.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve now shifted attention to the packaging market for market size and impact,&#8221; Rolandi said. &#8220;After all, we can substitute every surfboard in the world with our material and it&#8217;ll have some impact&#8212;but not as much as if we were to replace all the plastic packing material in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup is creating biodegradable packaging from chitin, which is the second-most abundant protein in the world and can be found in shrimp and lobster shells. It&#8217;s lighter, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly than polystyrene, which is commonly used today, said Felt.</p>
<p>Cruz Foam is just one of the many success stories coming out of Startup Sandbox, a biotech accelerator on Natural Bridges Drive that provides the support needed to transform some of the groundbreaking work coming out of UC Santa Cruz labs into market-ready products.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were three options: renting a warehouse for $10,000 a month, working in the cramped Sinsheimer Labs on campus, or Startup Sandbox,&#8221; Felts said. &#8220;[Startup Sandbox] leased us about 500 square feet we could use to develop our technology. Without that intermediate space we might have foundered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cruz Foam recently outgrew the laboratory and office space it rented from Startup Sandbox. The company is now in Soquel, in a 1,500 square-foot warehouse.</p>
<p>New state funding provided to the University of California helped to create the incubator in 2017. It has proven to be a crucial component of Santa Cruz&#8217;s bio boom. Startup Sandbox provides wet and dry laboratory space on demand, as well as office space and training seminars for companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fume hood, for example, rents for $25 an hour at Startup Sandbox,&#8221; Startup Sandbox President Lou Pambianco said. &#8220;To purchase, install, and run a hood would cost a fledgling company thousands of dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the current tenants, Unnatural Products, began in a founder&#8217;s garage, the origin story for many startups. However, the group soon learned they could not manufacture anything involving chemicals or biological agents in a residential area and were forced to rent lab space.</p>
<p>Unnatural Products moved to Startup Sandbox, and began renting a lab bench for $40 an hour.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by Cameron Pye and Joshua Schwochert, who both earned their Ph.D.s in chemistry from UC Santa Cruz. Among their first projects to launch is a cancer-fighting compound that earlier versions of couldn&#8217;t punch through the cell&#8217;s membrane. &#8220;We&#8217;re drugging the undruggable,&#8221; Pye explained. &#8220;What we do is design some of the rule-breaking properties that nature created into synthetic systems, which in turn allows us to design drugs against this intra-cellular undruggable space that has been off-limits up to date.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unnatural Products has been getting the attention of investors. It recently raised $6.25 million, which helped let them move down the street from Startup Sandbox and expand operations.</p>
<p>The Delaware corridor used to be home to industrial giants like Lipton Tea, Wrigley&#8217;s Gum, and Texas Instruments. But by the turn of the century, spiking energy prices, rising rents, high taxes, and the first tech bust in the late 90s forced many manufacturers to abandon the area.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started losing some of the manufacturing, we had to think about what industries would be able to thrive in the new economy,&#8221; said Bonnie Lipscomb, the City of Santa Cruz&#8217;s executive director for economic development.</p>
<p>The city saw that the work of David Haussler and his lab&#8212;which in 2000 published the first working draft of the human genome on the internet&#8212;could help support a new economy and create startups and spinoffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since then we&#8217;ve been doing everything we can to ensure the infrastructure to support them exists here and we&#8217;re doing everything we can to help them grow,&#8221; Lipscomb said.</p>
<p>The Genomics Institute, led by Haussler and based out of the Baskin School of Engineering, recently moved from its campus offices to the Westside Research Park at 2300 Delaware Ave. The university bought the former Texas Instruments silicon chip fabrication facility in 2004 and has been renovating the space to provide new lab space for researchers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a vision for a vibrant biotech scene just down the road from campus for a while now,&#8221; said Ann Pace, director of research development and finance at the Genomics Institute. &#8220;We develop a lot of cutting edge technology, and it makes sense to have companies nearby to facilitate interaction between budding industries and academia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Genomics Institute sits at a really interesting space between engineering and clinical work,&#8221; said Dean Wolf. &#8220;And physically, it acts as a sort of anchor for the startup environment along the Delaware Avenue corridor, which is why moving the Institute to this location, near campus and the Baskin School of Engineering, was so important.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the recent burst of activity supported by the incubators, the Westside has been ground zero for other biotech startups that are advancing technology developed at UC Santa Cruz. The co-founders of Ontera (formerly Two Pore Guys), on Delaware Avenue, met at UC Santa Cruz in 2010 and a year later started the company, which makes a digital, hand-held testing platform that detects viruses, bacteria, antibodies, and other biological molecules.</p>
<p>Claret Bioscience, a spinoff from the labs of Professors Ed Green and Beth Shapiro that was also supported by Startup Sandbox, is developing faster and more efficient ways for labs to prepare fragmented DNA for sequencing.</p>
<p>Claret Bioscience, Unnatural Products, and CruzFoam are among the first six companies to graduate from Startup Sandbox.</p>
<p>Felts says that Santa Cruz feels considerably different than it did even a few years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re beginning to feel the effects of having all these biotech startups popping up around here, there&#8217;s a network coming together,&#8221; Felts said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really excited to see what will happen.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="46c3f7d980727017760172d365e6a53c"><name>la-noche</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lick Observatory continues popular program for Spanish-speaking community</title><summary>‘La Noche de las Estrellas’ at Lick Observatory brings science to Spanish-speaking students and their families.</summary><keywords>Sandra Faber, David Koo, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</keywords><start-date>1573113600000</start-date><display-name>Lick Observatory continues popular program for Spanish-speaking community</display-name><path>/2019/11/la-noche</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/11/la-noche</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1573145278395</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1573150113523</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ashleigh Papp</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/11/images/lick-telescope-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/11/images/lick-telescope-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lick-telescope-410.jpg</name><display-name>lick-telescope-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>110289</file-size><width>410</width><height>369</height></image><image-alt>student looking through telescope</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/11/images/lick-telescope-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/11/images/lick-telescope-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lick-telescope-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>lick-telescope-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27290</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>student looking through telescope</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>High school students got to use the historic 36-inch Great Lick Refractor telescope at UC's Lick Observatory during La Noche de las Estrellas.

<p>Spanish was spoken throughout the event, from welcome messages to lectures and hands-on time with the telescopes. Inviting Latinx students and their parents to learn about science in the language they're most comfortable with allows adults to participate and learn alongside their children, said event organizers.</p>
<p>David Koo and Sandra Faber, both professors emeriti of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, started the program with the goal of showing Latinx students and their families that opportunities are available for them to learn about science and pursue careers in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and math). Offering families a joint learning experience may improve the chances of a Latinx student getting support from their family to attend college and pursue a science degree, <span>said Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and one of the main speakers at the event.</span></p>
<p>"If a student goes home from school and tells their family about science, for some parents it just feels foreign," <span>he said.</span></p>
<p>Koo noted that the Latinx community pursues STEM degrees at lower rates than many other minority groups. "There is often a gap between the aspirations of students and the expectations of their parents," he said. "We want to help close that gap."</p>
<p><strong>Awe-inspiring</strong></p>
<p>More than 100 participants in this year's event enjoyed an evening under the stars and the awe-inspiring experience of viewing the night sky through big telescopes. They were joined this year by new UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Campus Provost Lori Kletzer, as well as members of the Mexican Consulate General's office and University of Mexico faculty<span>. The special guests provided insight and perspective to parents about the challenges and importance of pursuing higher education in science.</span></p>
<p>To identify students most likely to benefit from La Noche, the organizers reached out to each high school's Math, Engineering and Science Achievement (MESA) program, an elective program for underrepresented students interested in science. Alex Garlets, a MESA teacher and advisor at Soledad High School, accompanied his students to this year's La Noche event.</p>
<p>"They had a blast," he said, adding that the ride back to Soledad was filled with excited conversation as students exchanged stories from the night's adventure. A few even proclaimed they could see themselves pursuing a career that would enable them to look through telescopes, Garlets said.</p>
<p>The students' enthusiasm carried over into class on Monday, as those who had attended La Noche shared their experiences and excitement with their fellow classmates. "A large portion of students have already asked me if the field trip is going to happen again next year," Garlets said.</p>
<p>Feedback from the parents who <span>attended was also positive, Faber said. One of the parents, while in conversation with her during the event, shared that it was her first time ever learning about science in Spanish, and that it gave her a new sense of empowerment. </span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Access to information</strong></p>
<p>When Faber and Koo started La Noche de las Estrellas in 2016, one of their goals was to increase the amount of information available in Spanish to visitors to Lick Observatory. Recently, the observatory has begun adding QR codes on all of their displays and educational materials. These codes will enable visitors to access explanations in Spanish and other languages on their cell phones.</p>
<p>Situated atop Mt. Hamilton east of San Jose, Lick Observatory was founded in 1888 and continues to be a leading astronomical research facility. With headquarters on the UCSC campus, it is also used by astronomers from eight other UC campuses.</p>
<p>During La Noche, UCSC astronomers, including faculty and graduate students, were available to host students and parents as they were amazed by the moon and other objects viewed through telescopes of varying sizes, including the 40-inch Nickel Telescope, one of the observatory's research telescopes, as well as the historic 36-inch Great Lick Refractor. Smaller telescopes were set up by volunteer amateur astronomers outside the observatory's domes for additional viewing opportunities.</p>
<p>Faber and Koo started La Noche de las Estrellas with funding from a major research grant from the National Science Foundation. Recent donations provided by the Crary Family and Hal Hyde ensure that La Noche will continue for the next three years. If they can get additional funding, Faber and Koo <span>plan to extend the reach of La Noche year-round by offering mentors to students and their families. </span></p>
<p>"One night isn't enough," Koo said. "Students need more ways to explore and learn about internship opportunities and college applications."</p>
<p>After three years, it's clear La Noche is a popular and successful event, and the organizers are ready to do more.</p>
<p>"My goal with all of this<span> is to have happy, empowered kids," Faber said. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="474c0bff80727017760172d35243a289"><name>book-launch</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Launch party for children's book 'Looking for Marla' November 15 at MAH</title><summary>UCSC graduate students Paloma Medina and Jessica Kendall-Bar and alumna Audrey Ford collaborated on the illustrated tale of a clownfish in transition.</summary><start-date>1573113600000</start-date><display-name>Launch party for children's book 'Looking for Marla' November 15 at MAH</display-name><path>/2019/11/book-launch</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/11/book-launch</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1573154196451</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1573179614854</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioweb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/11/images/launch-flyer-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/11/images/launch-flyer-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>launch-flyer-410.jpg</name><display-name>launch-flyer-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>171988</file-size><width>410</width><height>512</height></image><image-alt>book cover</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/11/images/launch-flyer-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/11/images/launch-flyer-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>launch-flyer-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>launch-flyer-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24716</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>book cover</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>UCSC graduate students Paloma Medina and Jessica Kendall-Bar and alumna Audrey Ford collaborated on the illustrated tale of a clownfish in transition</article-subhead><article-text><p>The Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History will host a book launch event on Friday, November 15, for the new children's book <em>Looking for Marla</em>, written and illustrated by graduate students at UC Santa Cruz. The event will be held from 7 to 9 p.m. and will feature performances by local artists.</p>
<p><em>Looking for Marla</em> tells the tale of a curious clownfish in transition as they find their way through fatherhood and into motherhood. In wild clownfish populations, a male will transition into the role of the dominant female when the female is removed from the community, a biological fact ignored in the movie <em>Finding Nemo</em>.</p>
<p>The book was written by Paloma Medina, a graduate student in biomolecular engineering, and UCSC alumna Audrey Ford, and illustrated by Jessica Kendall-Bar, a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology. It is available in both English and Spanish (translated by Karen Ross), and copies will be available at the event.</p>
<p>The book is intended for educators, parents, youth, and anyone wanting to learn about sex and gender diversity in nature and gender pronouns in a fun way. The <em>Looking for Marla</em> team hopes to inspire readers of all ages on their own journeys of gender expression and self-exploration as they explore the diversity of the underwater world. A portion of the book&#8217;s proceeds will be donated to the Diversity Center of Santa Cruz to support diverse communities in Santa Cruz and Watsonville counties.</p>
<p>The <em>Looking for Marla</em> book project was supported by the Kenneth Norris Center for Natural History at UC Santa Cruz, the Arts Council of Santa Cruz County, the City of Santa Cruz Arts Commission and Economic Development Office, the Diversity Center of Santa Cruz County, the&#160;<span>UCSC Science and Justice Research Center, and the Cantu&#160;Queer Resource Center</span>.</p>

href="https://ucsctickets.universitytickets.com/w/event.aspx?id=1352">The Frankenstein Project</a></em></strong><em>, </em>a modern adaptation of Mary Shelley&#8217;s classic <em>Frankenstein</em> story, opens at UC Santa Cruz on November 15 for a two weekend run at the Theater Arts Center&#8217;s Mainstage.</p>
<p>Set against the backdrop of the latest developments in science and medicine, the feminist and biotechnology-fueled play raises chilling issues of nature vs. nurture and our ethical responsibilities for what we invent and create.</p>
<p>The play is written and directed by UCSC theater arts lecturer Kirsten Brandt, a theatrical director, playwright and producer, with a passion for stirring the imagination of audiences through visceral storytelling that inspires dialogue and ethical engagement.</p>
<p>Her production takes a fresh look at questions of art, religion, and science at a time when the prospect of creating a Frankenstein monster is not just a random imaginary thought or fantasy, but rather something much closer to reality.</p>
<p><strong>In conjunction with <em>The Frankenstein Project</em></strong>, UCSC&#8217;s Humanities Institute and Arts Division will also present <strong><em><a href="https://frankencon.com/">FrankenCon</a></em></strong>&#8212;a three-day conference of scientists, theorists, authors, and artists who will all explore the Frankenstein legend&#8212;on November 21-23.</p>
<p><em>FrankenCon </em>kicks off on Thursday, November 21 with back-to-back film screenings of <em>Frankenstein</em> and <em>Bride of Frankenstein</em> in downtown Santa Cruz, at DNA&#8217;s Comedy Lab and Experimental Theatre.</p>
<p>The films will be followed by a talk and Q&amp;A with <em>Good Times</em> editor Steve Palopoli, UCSC Theater Arts professor and conference organizer Michael Chemers, UCSC literature professor Renee Fox, and UCSC computational media professor Tad Leckman.</p>
<p>Highlights of the weekend include a &#8220;Science and Ethics&#8221; roundtable discussion on Saturday afternoon, moderated by Chemers and featuring UCSC faculty--including former chancellor and astronomy professor George Blumenthal, Genomics Institute director David Haussler, and sociology professor Jenny Reardon.</p>
<p>They will discuss such topics as &#8220;What is &#8216;mad science&#8217; and how do we guard against it? and &#8220;What has Frankenstein taught scientists and cultural critics about the dangers of science without conscience?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>FrankenCon will also host three special guests </strong>in conversation during the conference, each followed by audience Q&amp;As.</p>
<p><em>New York Times</em>&#160;bestselling author Kiersten White will talk about the development of her novel,&#160;<em>The Dark Descent of Elizabeth Frankenstein. </em>White&#160;is also the author of the&#160;<em>And I Darken</em>&#160;trilogy, the&#160;<em>Paranormalcy</em>&#160;trilogy,&#160;<em>Beanstalker</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Other Hilarious Scarytales</em>,&#160;<em>Slayer</em>, and several other novels.</p>
<p>Playwright and TV writer Jennifer Haley will discuss the ways she combines technology and horror in her writing (<em>The Nether, Hemlock Grove, Mindhunter</em>). Haley&#8217;s work examines ethics in virtual reality and the impact of technology on our human relationships, identity, and desire.</p>
<p>And <em>The Frankenstein Project</em> playwright and director Kirsten Brandt will join the above guests for a conversation about their connection to Mary Shelley&#8217;s <em>Frankenstein</em> and the challenges and delights of reinterpreting its themes for modern audiences.</p>
<p>UCSC arts and humanities faculty will additionally participate in a roundtable discussion about the impact of Frankenstein on the last two centuries of literature, theater, film, and games.</p>
<p><em>FrankenCon</em> draws to a close with a desert reception for guests and attendees featuring &#8220;FrankenCupcakes&#8221; at 5 p.m. on Saturday, at UCSC&#8217;s Digital Arts Research Center (Room 308).</p>

<p>We are proud to be part of a university system that seeks to uphold the civil and privacy rights of all its community members regardless of immigration status. We are stronger as a university system, and as a campus community, when we stand united. UC Santa Cruz is built on a foundation of social justice, and our commitment to the rights of our students and employees, no matter their immigration status, is essential to that foundation.</p>
<p>DACA protections must be made permanent. The policy has been invaluable for roughly 700,000 undocumented young people. It has enabled them to go to college, to work, and to live without fear of deportation. They know our country as home. They are business owners, employees, taxpayers, and military members. And they are students with families, friends, and deep human connections in communities across our state and country. This is why we must go beyond DACA. Our values do not allow us to leave behind older students, families, and our community members who do not meet the DACA criteria. The stratification of human beings through immigration policies hurts us all.</p>
<p>We proudly stand alongside them and the thousands of others impacted by this administration's capricious decision to end DACA. UC as a whole, and UC Santa Cruz as a campus, will continue to provide a safe and supportive environment for students and employees of every immigration status including DACA, non-DACA, Temporary Protected Status, and undocumented. UC Santa Cruz police will not aid any effort to investigate, detain or arrest individuals for violation of federal immigration law.</p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, our undocumented student community has asked for more than just an email voicing support. We are committed to continuing that conversation and to better supporting our students. Thank you for your advocacy and partnership as we face the uncertainty of this court case and beyond. We are committed to facing it together.</p>

Many advanced techniques are gaining traction in real-world applications, due in large part to the rise of decentralized cryptocurrencies and blockchains. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>One major obstacle to widespread deployment of advanced cryptographic technologies is that programming distributed cryptographic systems requires the programmer to be a skilled cryptographer. The challenges, therefore, include not only performance, but usability and practical deployment: how to deploy these techniques without dedicated cryptographers.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Researchers at UC Santa Cruz, in collaboration with IBM Research and three other institutions (Cornell University, Oregon State University, and the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign), will attempt to overcome this challenge through a project called <em>PASCAL: Programming Architecture for Secure Cryptographic Applications</em>. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The $14.7 million project is funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) through its Homomorphic Encryption Computing Techniques with Overhead Reduction (<a href="https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/hector">HECTOR</a>) program.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The investigators on the project say that PASCAL will enable widespread deployment of advanced cryptographic technologies through usable implementation of existing and new cryptographic tools, programming languages that establish the constructs and metadata needed to specify and reason about properties of those tools, and systems implementing high-level compilers and development tools that use the metadata to deploy crypto tools as needed.</span></p>
<p><span>A key component of the project is a new programming language, called <em>Blaze</em>, which offers a high-level programming model for building secure distributed applications with advanced cryptographic mechanisms. <em>Blaze</em> is the lynchpin of the project, allowing non-expert programmers to leverage underlying cryptographic tools.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Owen Arden, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at UCSC, will lead the design, specification, and implementation of <em>Blaze</em>. Arden is an expert in language-based approaches to security and is considered a pioneer in applying security-typed programming languages to distributed programming. In 2018, he won a five year, $500,000 CAREER award from the National Science Foundation to investigate a language-based approach to building inherently secure decentralized applications (see <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/news/computer-scientist-owen-arden-wins-nsf-career-award">news story</a>).</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Finding good programming abstractions for security mechanisms is very challenging,&#8221; said Arden. &#8220;Without them, programmers tend to stick to the familiar, or worse, use the new mechanisms incorrectly.

(Photo by Evan Ho)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>This article is one in a series of stories that spotlight incoming graduate students and the obstacles they&#8217;ve overcome to pursue an advanced degree.</em></p>
<p>Five years ago, Mario Alberto G&#243;mez-Zamora worked with teen-agers to collect stories from elders in a P'urh&#233;pecha indigenous community in Patamban, Michoac&#225;n, Mexico.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old Michoac&#225;n native was concerned about young people losing their history and he wanted to make sure young people could hear directly from elders about life in the past. The group together collected stories about the mountains, how people used to have fun and more. The stories were published in Spanish by the Universidad Michoacana and are being translated into English and P&#8217;urh&#233;pecha.</p>
<p>He is pursuing a doctoral degree in Latin American and Latino Studies at UC Santa Cruz because he would like to help Latinos through workshops, cultural events, activism and research. He would also like to work one day as a professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be an inspiration for my students,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to show them that this can be possible as an immigrant- that it doesn&#8217;t matter who you are &#8211; sexual identity, ethnicity and color. Now I am here.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a tough road for G&#243;mez-Zamora to get to this point as he is a first-generation college student and he had to learn English to be able to attend grad school at UC Santa Cruz. He took classes at UC Davis to prepare for the transition.</p>
<p>While he was raised in Mexico, G&#243;mez-Zamora is not a newcomer to California. His parents have lived in Tracy in the Central Valley for more than a decade. His father arrived in Southern California in 1980 so he could work in auto painting.</p>
<p>G&#243;mez-Zamora said that learning more about his P&#8217;urh&#233;pecha heritage, including traditional medicine and collected memories, allowed him to freely accept himself as a homosexual man&#8212;&#8220;a dual spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He loves living in California because so many people from Michoac&#225;n are here, especially in Watsonville. Many of them are from the P'urh&#233;pecha indigenous community, he said. &#8220;There are many people doing the same traditions and rituals that we are doing in Michoac&#225;n.&#8221;</p>
<p>He likes California&#8217;s more liberal attitudes about homosexuality. &#8220;I feel more freedom here to be myself and to recognize who I am,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He was attracted to UC Santa Cruz because it has the only Latin American and Latino studies program in the United States. He is excited about the chance to explore his interest in history, anthropology and ethnographic studies.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6742fd7280727017760172d36dc64ca2"><name>title-ix-interns</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student interns work to prevent sexual assault, discrimination</title><summary>The campus created four paid student internships to increase student engagement with and by the Title IX Office.</summary><start-date>1573632000000</start-date><display-name>Student engagement</display-name><path>/2019/11/title-ix-interns</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/11/title-ix-interns</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1573690473781</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1573690612272</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/11/images/group-ix-interns-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/11/images/group-ix-interns-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>group-ix-interns-500px.jpg</name><display-name>group-ix-interns-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>138693</file-size><width>500</width><height>375</height></image><image-alt>The four Title IX interns</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/11/images/group-ix-interns-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/11/images/group-ix-interns-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>group-ix-interns-80px.jpg</name><display-name>group-ix-interns-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>12663</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Title IX interns</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Title IX Office student interns conduct many of the university&#8217;s prevention trainings.

<p>The paid internships were created to increase student engagement with and by the Title IX Office. The Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor&#8217;s Office provided the financial support for the program.</p>
<p>This year, the office hired two undergraduates and two graduate students. They will be working throughout the year&#8212;between five to 20 hours a week&#8212;doing peer-led workshops and education and devising their own projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to see what ideas the students come up with,&#8221; said Laura Young-Hinck, the response coordinator for the Title IX Office. &#8220;We want the students to develop the internship program.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Title IX website, the office is &#8220;committed to fostering a campus climate in which members of our community are protected from all forms of sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual violence and gender-based harassment and discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Approved in 1972, Title IX prohibits educational institutions receiving federal funds from discriminating on the basis of sex.</p>
<p>Sexual abuse in college is rampant across the country. Recent studies have found that one in 16 male-identified students and one in four women-identified students are sexually assaulted in college, Young-Hinck said.</p>
<p>She said she hopes the interns will help eliminate barriers to reporting or getting help and increase communication and conversation between the Title IX Office and students.</p>
<p>Read on to learn more about each intern:</p>
<h3>Alea Evans</h3>
<p>A fourth-year student studying psychology, Alea Evans is glad to do anything she can to help make the campus safer for everyone.</p>
<p>Growing up in Oakland, she found that sexual violence was prevalent but tolerated in the community. She finds that with people of color, incidents are less likely to be reported. &#8220;It&#8217;s really important to me as a person of color on campus that my face is seen so (sexual violence) doesn&#8217;t just seem like a problem for non-people of color,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Among the jobs she has taken on as a Title IX intern is reaching out to resident assistants in dorms to let them know about the Title IX office and what it does and to let them know that the interns and staff are available to participate in workshops or give talks.</p>
<p>She hopes to let people know that the office does not just deal with crimes but also gender discrimination. She wants students who are non-binary or trans to know that if they feel discriminated because of gender identity, they can report it to the Title IX office.</p>
<p>Evans is also interested in helping people think of ways they can make the campus safer. As an inspiring example, Evans pointed to a story shared by one of her fellow interns. The intern was at a party and saw people dancing with a girl who they were trying to convince to come home with them. The intern didn&#8217;t think the girl had the ability at that time to give consent so the intern found the party host, who then found the girl&#8217;s friends, who took care of the problem.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to speak up when you see something wrong, Evans said. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t feel comfortable, you can delegate to someone who knows what they&#8217;re doing,&#8221; like an authority figure, she said.</p>
<h3>Mia Buak</h3>
<p>Mia Buak, a third-year legal studies major, is passionate about women&#8217;s rights and has volunteered at Santa Cruz&#8217;s Walnut Avenue Family &amp; Women&#8217;s Center which assists victims of domestic violence and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>The Santa Cruz native said she is interested in empowering women to have a voice and say no to unwanted attention. It&#8217;s a tough road because most females learn from a young age to not say no strongly, she said. &#8220;People try to be nice and say &#8216;not right now.&#8217;&#8221; Buak believes there should be more education about assertiveness and the freedom everyone has to say no.</p>
<p>Buak said it is often hard for victims of abuse to report what happened because there is still a lot of shame about it. When she interned at the probation department, she found that people would often recant their accusations and say that they didn&#8217;t want to pursue any prosecution.</p>
<p>To in some way combat that attitude, the Title IX interns emphasized to new students at trainings this year that even if drugs or alcohol were involved, students may still report abusive behavior. The interns tried to be clear that use of substance should never hold someone back from addressing abuse.</p>
<p>She hopes that in her internship she can help raise more awareness about the campus&#8217;s Title IX office. She thinks the office is more known for investigating abuse than for its role in prevention and education. She hopes that through the interns&#8217; work, students will feel the office is more approachable to get information or ask questions.</p>
<h3>Sona Kaur</h3>
<p>Sona Kaur, a doctoral student studying social psychology, is focusing on raising awareness of emotional and psychological abuse in intimate partner relationships. This aspect of abuse is often overlooked because you can&#8217;t see it as easily, she said.</p>
<p>She believes students are aware in general of what unhealthy relationships look like and what sexual violence looks like, but at times it can be difficult to label certain behaviors as such. They sometimes have trouble addressing these issues with their partners because there is so much else to take into account- like their feelings about the person and the time they&#8217;ve invested in the relationship. &#8220;There are just so many things that cloud the experience,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It can be difficult to do something about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like her fellow Title IX intern Ike Minton, she is interested in how pop culture conveys relationships. &#8220;I&#8217;m really interested in looking at how different media forms romanticize violence and unhealthy relationships,&#8221; she said. For instance, she is intrigued that movies like the <em>Twilight</em> series and <em>50 Shades of Gray</em> and more recently, the Netflix series <em>You</em> are so popular while depicting abusive relationships. She also examined Bollywood movies that romanticize abusive practices.</p>
<p>She wants to focus on the tricky role graduate students find themselves in navigating Title IX. On one hand, as teachers, they must be able to provide support and resources to undergraduates affected by harassment and violence. On the other hand, as students themselves, they may experience an abuse of power by faculty and professors who serve as their advisors.</p>
<p>Kaur is also beginning to work on a campaign to promote sexual violence awareness month in April and to create some kind of workshop or event that will bring together different people on campus who are researching or working on ways to keep all students and faculty safe from abuse and harassment.</p>
<h3>Ike Minton</h3>
<p>Ike Minton, a composer, keyboardist, oboist, and doctoral student in music, was inspired to become an intern because of his own experiences with friends and family facing harassment.</p>
<p>He is keenly aware of the responsibility members of a university community have to students. Many times, students put a lot of trust in the university system and its people. When that trust is broken, it can scar students, he said. &#8220;If we&#8217;re going to place responsibility on teachers for helping guide our next generation, we need to make sure those relationships are cultivated to help people grow, not scare them away,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Minton is particularly interested in how popular culture affects relationships. He is doing his own research to find songs that give examples of affirmative consent&#8212;where someone asks for a yes before moving a relationship into romantic contact. There are some but they are hard to find, he said. He asked incoming students if they knew of any such songs during his presentations about Title IX in the beginning of the year. After surveying about 5,000 students, one student came up with one example: &#8220;Get a Yes&#8221; by Sad 13.</p>
<p>His goal is to get more people talking about what affirmative consent means. He likes when he gets students talking about this issue, even if they disagree or aren&#8217;t sure what it means. &#8220;It&#8217;s OK to have boundaries, it&#8217;s OK to say &#8216;no,&#8217; to some things and &#8216;yes&#8217; to others,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He believes the situation would be much improved for everyone if the culture shifted from putting the emphasis only on someone to disagree (a &#8220;no means no&#8221; model) to ideas around affirmative consent (all parties working through a more conversational approach to dialogue).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6b3b795580727017760172d349e19f25"><name>upcoming-long-range-dev-plan-workshops</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Upcoming Long Range Development Plan Workshops</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz will hold a series of workshops to discuss the future of UC Santa Cruz campus land use, including progress to date and next steps. </summary><start-date>1573718400000</start-date><display-name>Upcoming Long Range Development Plan Workshops</display-name><path>/2019/11/upcoming-long-range-dev-plan-workshops</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/11/upcoming-long-range-dev-plan-workshops</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1573757090106</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1573757515920</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>UC Santa Cruz will hold a series of workshops to discuss the future of UC Santa Cruz campus land use, including progress to date and next steps. <br/><br/>The goal of these meetings is to collaborate with the campus and the local community to address issues of mutual importance.

<p>Ward promoted the campus tirelessly until her retirement in 1992. Following her departure, she continued her solo adventures through the western United States and Canada in her signature pumpkin-colored Vanagon camper van.</p>
<p>"Joan was smart, conscientious, just the right amount of quirky, devoted, and completely reliable," recalled Jim Burns, former director of the Public Information Office and a longtime colleague of Ward's. "She wrote expertly about everything from astronomy to the History of Consciousness. It's not an overstatement to say Joan had an encyclopedic knowledge of UCSC's first quarter century, and the campus missed that&#8212;and her&#8212;greatly upon her retirement."</p>
<p>Ward, who sported large, round, black-framed glasses for decades, was a well-known figure on campus. For years after her retirement, she returned every December to the Public Information Office, then located in the Carriage House, to host a warm, boisterous holiday celebration for her former colleagues. The sight of Ward rolling up in her Vanagon would bring cheers from the staff.</p>
<p>"She seemed immortal," said former art director Jim MacKenzie, another early colleague of Ward's. "What I always will remember, and cherish, was the strong sense of camaraderie we all felt. Joan was no small part of that camaraderie. She got it, and soldiered on, because she believed in higher education and research in the public interest."&#160;</p>
<p>A native of San Mateo, Ward graduated from Stanford University with a degree in journalism. She spent two years in the Peace Corps in Ecuador, where she became fluent in Spanish. Decades before microfinance became trendy, she established a small business where women in Ecuador could sell hand-woven wool sweaters in the United States.</p>
<p>Ward enjoyed opera, symphony, ballet, and travel through Europe, as well as spending time with her family, including her beloved nieces, her nephew, and their children, many of whom live in Northern California.</p>
<p>Family and friends are invited to attend a celebration of her life on Friday, Nov. 29, 2019 at 1 p.m. at the Skylawn Funeral Home and Memorial Park on Highway 92 at Skyline Blvd. in San Mateo, California.</p>

<p>It is with deep sadness that we write to share the news that Michael William Murphy, a Senior Building Maintenance Worker at Lick Observatory, died Tuesday, November 5.</p>
<p>Michael was a dedicated employee who prided himself on preserving and restoring the grounds and buildings at Lick Observatory. Michael grew up in Superior, Wisconsin. He loved the outdoors, going fishing on the Brule River, and deer hunting in Barnes. The fact that he loved the outdoors speaks volumes as to why he ultimately ended up at Lick Observatory with its incredible views of the Diablo Mountain Range and the Santa Clara Valley.</p>

A new study shows that stickleback populations in estuaries along the coast of California have evolved over the past 40 years as climate change has altered their coastal habitats.</p>
<p>The study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/GCB.14892">published November 21 in <em>Global Change Biology</em></a>, looked at variation in the armoring that protects the stickleback from predators, specifically the number of bony plates along their sides (called lateral plates). Previous research showed that populations in northern California have a more complete set of this armoring than populations in southern California, corresponding to differences in their habitats.</p>
<p>"There's a gradient from drier systems in the south, where the estuaries are more pond-like, with more vegetation, to increasingly more open, river-like systems as you go north," explained coauthor Eric Palkovacs, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The new study found that threespine stickleback in some California estuaries are evolving to have fewer lateral plates as their habitats become more pond-like due to a warmer, drier climate. Stickleback populations at some central California sites are now looking more like the low-plated populations typical of southern California.</p>
<p>"The lateral plates provide armoring, but the downside is it costs energy to build them and they can limit maneuverability," Palkovacs said. The vegetation and other structural features found in slow-moving water are thought to increase the need for maneuverability and decrease the need for armoring because the stickleback have more places to escape or hide from predators.</p>
<p><strong>Historical specimens</strong></p>
<p>Palkovacs and first author Simone Des Roches, who led the study as a postdoctoral researcher in his lab at UC Santa Cruz, took advantage of an opportunity to study historical specimens of threespine stickleback from surveys conducted along the California coast by coauthor Michael Bell in the 1970s. Bell, who has spent most of his career studying sticklebacks, recently retired from Stony Brook University in New York and is now affiliated with the Museum of Paleontology at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>"It's a real treat for me toward the end of my career to have collaborators who are able to get added value out of these collections," Bell said.</p>
<p>Des Roches and Palkovacs resurveyed the same sites where Bell had collected stickleback specimens in the 1970s and early 80s. They found that the frequency of low-plated stickleback has generally increased over time. Furthermore, the southern limit of the distribution of completely-plated stickleback has moved northward.</p>
<p>Previous research had already established the genetic basis of the differences seen in the lateral plates of threespine stickleback, and genetic testing of the fish Des Roches collected confirmed this.</p>
<p>"We know the genetics underpinning this trait and how it correlates with the environment, so we have these well established relationships of the genes to the morphological traits and the traits to the environment. That allows us to infer that what we're seeing is evolutionary change," said Des Roches, who is now at the University of Washington.</p>
<p>She added that, although this study focused on the lateral plates, other traits are probably also evolving in response to climate-driven changes in the habitat. For example, the fish Des Roches collected in the Big Sur River in 2017 not only have fewer lateral plates than the ones Bell collected in 1974, their overall morphology is also strikingly different.</p>
<p>"Their head shape and mouth shape are completely different, which is consistent with eating different prey. We didn't look at those traits in this study, but I have an idea of what you might find if you did," Des Roches said.</p>
<p><strong>Climate change</strong></p>
<p>Bell said it's not surprising that stickleback populations in California are evolving in response to climate change, because his previous research had shown how rapidly this species can evolve. He has done extensive research in Alaska looking at what happens when sea-run stickleback colonize freshwater lakes.</p>
<p>"In Alaska, stickleback go from the morphology of sea-run fish to that of freshwater fish in less than ten generations. The difference is that these populations in California are staying in the same place and the environment is changing around them, causing them to evolve," Bell said.</p>
<p>The evidence that climate change is altering the genetic composition of natural populations is significant, he said. Other studies have found morphological changes in plants or animals associated with climate change, but very few have shown changes in traits for which the underlying genetic basis is well established.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of this study is that the changes in stickleback are occurring in response to a climate-driven transformation of their habitat. "We tend to focus on the direct effects on organisms of increased temperatures or changes in precipitation, but we also have to think about how climate change will impact the characteristics of the habitats those organisms rely on," Palkovacs said.</p>
<p>As more stickleback populations become dominated by fish with few lateral plates, the gene variant (or allele) for the completely-plated morphology could disappear from those populations, Des Roches said. This loss of genetic diversity could limit the adaptability of those populations in the future if, for example, a new predator were introduced into their environment.</p>
<p>"They might lack the genetic variation required to adapt, making them more vulnerable to extinction," Des Roches said.</p>

<p>The findings were issued in a report, <em><a href="https://fliphtml5.com/mtnrt/mmsn">Tracking the Meal Gap in Santa Cruz County: An Index of Food Insecurity, 2014-2018</a></em>, that was released Nov. 13 at a gathering of nonprofit, government, and community stakeholders.&#160;</p>
<p>The report was produced by the<a href="https://blumcenter.ucsc.edu/"> UC Santa Cruz Blum Center on Poverty, Social Enterprise, and Participatory Governance</a> and<a href="https://www.thefoodbank.org/"> Second Harvest Food Bank Santa Cruz County</a>.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2017-18, 43% of food assistance needs went unmet among households earning less than $50,000 annually, even after accounting for assistance provided by government and nonprofit sources, including CalFresh and food banks.&#160;</li>
<li>Santa Cruz County households with annual earnings of less than $50,000 missed 21 million meals in 2017-18. If these missed meals were distributed equally among households in this income bracket, this would mean that each person missed approximately five meals per week, and was likely forced to seek less expensive, less nutritious options or go hungry.&#160;&#160;</li>
<li>Food assistance would need to nearly double to meet the needs of households earning under $50,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2014-2018 Food Insecurity Index refers to the "meal gap" between the total number of meals needed by low-income households and the number of meals provided. People are considered food insecure if they have limited or uncertain access to nutritious, safe food. Common indicators include skipping meals, hunger, and cutting down on portions.</p>
<p>"This is the first time an index of this kind has been calculated in our county," said Heather Bullock, a professor of psychology and the director of the Blum Center. "This report is our first step in mobilizing diverse stakeholders to work together on this issue."</p>
<p>The report, which includes recommendations for reducing food insecurity, will be issued annually with an updated index. "We believe this will quickly become an invaluable community resource," said Bullock.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations and collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Increasing<a href="https://www.getcalfresh.org/?source=g2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAk7TuBRDQARIsAMRrfUa8JFoqbWYcgviEcXMANijWDQnfCBn0WPCwckj4CRDjftqKeUidArkaAogdEALw_wcB"> CalFresh</a> enrollment reduces food insecurity, and the authors calculate that if all eligible residents enrolled, county residents would access an additional 5 million meals&#8212;reducing missing meals by about 20 percent.</p>
<p>"Reducing the stigma associated with food assistance programs is crucial," said Bullock.</p>
<p>The report also noted a decline between 2014-2018 in the most vulnerable population, which the authors attribute to rising housing costs that are forcing out low-income households. The cost of living in Santa Cruz County contributes to the county having the second-highest effective poverty rate in the state, as well as the second-highest food insecurity rate, said Willy Elliott-McCrea, chief executive officer of Second Harvest Food Bank. Households making less than $50,000 annually may spend an average of 75% of their income on shelter, he said.</p>
<p>"The increase in shelter costs feeds the cycle of food insecurity and chronic disease," he said. "We know that food insecurity can cause poor health and poor health in turn can deepen food insecurity."</p>
<p>David Amaral, a doctoral candidate in politics at UC Santa Cruz, built the index in consultation with Michael Enos, who has provided similar training to other counties, by gathering data from governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and nonprofits.</p>
<p>"This index is different from national indices, because we have specific information about food assistance provided by food banks and nonprofits and NGOs," said Amaral. "Our goal was to establish the extent of food insecurity and how much it's being met in this county."</p>
<p>The Nov. 13 gathering marked the first time all the local food and nutrition providers gathered together to talk about how to address the cycle of food insecurity.</p>
<p>"It was gratifying that the research seemed to be directly and immediately useful to the people on the ground who are trying to address these problems," said Amaral. "That doesn&#8217;t happen every day in academia."</p>
<p>Attendees honed in on a map that identified three key areas where a high proportion of residents qualify for food assistance but aren't enrolled. The biggest so-called "SNAP gaps" are in central Santa Cruz, Capitola, and Watsonville. "It was exciting to see people starting to forge a network, and to hear their eagerness to start developing strategies to address the problems that were showing up," said Amaral.</p>
<p>"This collaboration, with university researchers teaming up with community partners, embodies the best of what we can do when we work together to address social problems," said Katharyne Mitchell, dean of the Division of Social Sciences at UCSC. "I look forward to seeing the progress that comes from this partnership."</p>
<p>Elliott-McCrea, whose food bank reaches more than 55,000 people each month, underscored the value of working together. "The more we can leverage and cross-promote and advocate for the full range of nutrition programs, the more effective we'll all become," said Elliott-McCrea.</p>
<p>Second Harvest, founded in 1972, was the first food bank in California and is the second-oldest in the nation. It distributes over 8 million pounds of food annually to 100 food pantries, schools, soup kitchens, group homes, and youth centers, as well as 100 Second Harvest sites. Among the other local organizations that contributed data for the report were Grey Bears, Community Bridges, and Valley Churches United Missions.&#160;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The awards were presented Friday (Nov. 15) at the annual Fall breakfast hosted by Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell. In attendance was UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cindy Larive, as well as approximately 100 faculty and staff from across the Social Sciences Division.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It&#8217;s a pleasure to come together each year to recognize this talented team of faculty and staff," said Mitchell. "I am proud of the Social Science Division's commitment to social justice, equity and environmental protection, a commitment and dedication that is reflected in the work of this year's awardees."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The awards presented included:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Golden Apple Teaching Award: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve McKay, an associate professor of sociology, was recognized for the innovative pedagogy he has developed over the last six years, called Community Initiated Student Engaged Research (CISER). Students indicate that they learn a tremendous amount in McKay&#8217;s courses and are inspired by the experience of becoming producers of knowledge that plays a role in transforming our world.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Martin M. Chemers Award for Outstanding Research</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Two candidates were recognized this year for their outstanding contributions in their respective fields: Education Professor Judit Moschkovich, and Environmental Studies Professor Weixin Cheng.&#160;</span>Moschkovich&#8217;s contributions to mathematics education have had a profound impact on the field. She is widely recognized for her groundbreaking interdisciplinary research on the intersection of mathematical reasoning and language, with a special focus on bilingual/multilingual learners.&#160;Cheng is known for his cutting-edge research in soil science, particularly plant-soil interactions in a framework of global change. He established the field of rhizosphere priming, and his work highlights its role in the global carbon cycle.&#160;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Outstanding Staff Awards: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two recipients were selected this year from department staff: Lin Weyers, d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">epartment manager for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Studies, and Deanna Sla</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ter, college administrative officer of College Nine and College Ten. One recipient from division staff was chosen this year: Doug Niven, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cademic computing expert for the Division of Social Sciences.&#160;</span>Weyers is known as a &#8220;go getter&#8221; across the Environmental Studies department. Her leadership, competence, and spirit is felt throughout the department, and she is credited with helping get the department through challenging times. Slater was recognized for her vision and her contributions to the academic mission of Colleges Nine and College Ten. She was instrumental in bringing these colleges together and creating programs, such as <span>The CoCurricular Programs Office ("The CoCo").&#160;</span>Niven was chosen for his ITS work within the Social Sciences Division. Niven was recognized for going "above and beyond" as he helped colleagues utilize technology to make their work lives easier and more efficient. The impact of his cheerful support reached people in many different areas of the division.&#160;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Distinguished Social Sciences Emeriti Award:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">John Brown Childs, professor emeritus of sociology, was honored as a pioneer in community engaged scholarship, an inspirational teacher, and a committed local and global citizen. Childs, who retired some ten years ago, has continued to lecture and publish on his theory of transcommunality and transcommunal cooperation; on indigenous studies and the emerging theoretical framework of &#8220;indigeneity&#8221;; and on the history of African Americans within U.S. and European social movements. His scholarship is inextricably linked to his commitment to conflict resolution and nonviolence. This past winter, Childs created a College Ten course, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcommunal Cooperation and Peace Making</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/03/childs-soledad.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brought UCSC undergraduates to the Soledad Correctional Training Facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn collaboratively with incarcerated men.&#160;&#160;</span></li>

Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC Santa Cruz’s eighth college is a haven for sustainability-minded, environmentally conscious students hoping to lead and empower others </article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When College Eight changed its name to Rachel Carson College three years ago, it sent a bold and clear message to the campus community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the example of a pioneering environmentalist who sounded the warning of the harmful effects of pesticides, the college reaffirmed its commitment to a greener world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renaming gift from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation recognizes Rachel Carson for her courageous writing, activism, and advocacy. That gift was an essential part of a $7 million package that established an endowment and a chair in ecology and environmental justice, providing students with a wealth of research and hands-on learning opportunities in perpetuity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Carson College, also known as RCC, has an extensive environmental history that predates the rededication. In fact, it never wavered from its theme of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environment and Society </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">since its founding in 1972.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the recent renaming and endowment gave RCC a renewed and focused mission, which now includes experiential learning and additional program opportunities revolving around sustainable missions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a strong sense of community at Rachel Carson College, and programs are designed to support student leadership and empowerment,&#8221; said Tamara Ball, project scientist, academic coordinator, and lecturer at the college. &#8220;RCC students take initiative in creating organizations and implementing impactful projects that counteract the collective dysphoria surrounding environmental issues, while attracting broader involvement.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<strong>Honoring an environmental prophet&#160;</strong>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Carson&#8217;s name first came to the spotlight when her controversial book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silent Spring, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">published in 1962, ignited a nationwide discussion about chemical compounds in pesticides such as DDT. Her book exposed their devastating impacts on the environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just through the written word, Carson was able to communicate why these environmental changes were so important to the public,&#8221; said Sue Carter, Rachel Carson College provost and professor of physics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carson showed that a single book could institute sweeping changes, Carter said. Carson&#8217;s book provoked a fierce backlash from the chemical industry, but her resilient quest to educate and inform the public led to the banning of DDT and the founding of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a decade after her bestselling book was published, ultimately initiating the modern day environmental movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To symbolize the legacy she left behind, the artist Rachel Maryam Smith (Porter &#8216;18, history of art and visual culture) sculpted a bronze statue of Rachel Carson, which now resides in the RCC plaza. And most recently, the RCC Student Council completed the Rachel Carson mural project, which is displayed on the side of one of the buildings facing the dorms.&#160;</span></p>
<strong>Socially active, sustainability-minded&#160;</strong>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Carson College students are a thriving and active group.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are one of the more socially active colleges at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Ryan Meckel (Rachel Carson '21, business management economics). &#8220;It&#8217;s almost its own little world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meckel appreciates the intimacy of the college&#8217;s layout.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The dining hall, gym, and buildings are right there together instead of being spread out,&#8221; he said.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The layout contributes to the social atmosphere; there is usually something going on in the plaza or grassy quads, from pop-up produce stands to impromptu volleyball and soccer matches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this bustling activity kicks off during move-in week, when students are encouraged to build friendships and get involved in clubs and organizations throughout the college and on campus. The organizations based at Rachel Carson College, including the RCC Student Council, share a passion for green initiatives. They fund programs and take part in the college&#8217;s Earth Day celebration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The council and other organizations offered on campus all opened my eyes to how much students can do, and more importantly helped me realize that a lot of decisions are made in small groups,&#8221; said Rosa Guzman (Rachel Carson &#8216;21, mathematics).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This social activity and engagement helps students feel at home on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Finding their space in the first year carries over to the rest of their time at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Ben Nissan, coordinator for residential education at Rachel Carson College. &#8220;It has a direct, positive impact on college retention.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<strong>Environment and Society</strong>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rigorous RCC core course, taken in the first year, builds on the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environment and Society</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> theme of the college, immersing students in the history of the environmental movement, climate change, food justice, and social and environmental justice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10-week course begins with students reading three critical chapters from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silent Spring,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> igniting conversations around environmental justice and society.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The course ends with a research project. Students can focus on an environmental issue of their choice. The projects often involve argument and analysis, but even more importantly, students experience &#8220;what it means to be curious and be involved in inquiry through field observation,&#8221; noted Joy Hagen, Rachel Carson College lecturer and writing program liaison.&#160;</span></p>
<strong>Green-conscious programs</strong>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Carson College gives students plenty of opportunities to delve into environmental issues. While serving as a recent RCC provost, Ronnie Lipschutz, professor of politics, developed the sustainability studies minor, encouraging an interdisciplinary approach to sustainable project design and policy that balances the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), and social science.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students can also apply for a chance to use the campus&#8217;s Sustainability Lab, also known as the S-lab, a special collaboration between Rachel Carson College and the Physical and Biological Sciences Department located on Science Hill. The S-lab provides students with space to work on projects of interest. Those who get approval must also undergo Environmental Health and Safety training to work in the lab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the advantages of the S-lab is that it&#8217;s not focused on research as much,&#8221; said Theo Kell (Rachel Carson '21, technology and information management). Students often partake in projects outside of their fields of study.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kell, along with fellow Rachel Carson student Meckel, formed the UC Santa Cruz Slugbotics team during their freshman year. The only underwater robotics engineering club on campus, Slugbotics garnered 300 sign-ups just this fall. The S-lab space and resources allowed the club to grow and succeed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of its green-conscious programs, Rachel Carson College tends to attract undergraduates who have a strong interest in spreading environmental consciousness and getting involved in environmental initiatives.

<p>The 2019 <a href="https://recognition.webofsciencegroup.com/highly-cited">Highly Cited Researchers</a> list, released November 19 by the Web of Science Group, identifies scientists and social scientists who produced multiple papers ranking in the top 1% by citations for their field and year of publication, demonstrating significant research influence among their peers.</p>
<p>UCSC faculty on the list include <strong>Natalie Batalha</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Fortney</strong>, both professors of astronomy and astrophysics, and <strong>Garth Illingworth</strong>, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics; <strong>David Haussler</strong>, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute; and <strong>Jin Zhang</strong> and <strong>Yat Li</strong>, both professors of chemistry and biochemistry, and <strong>Yichuan Ling</strong>, a former graduate student in Li&#8217;s lab.</p>
<p>The list also includes <strong>Mark Diekhans</strong>, technical director of the Genomics Institute&#8217;s Computational Genomics Laboratory, and <strong>James Kent</strong>, creator and director of the UCSC Genome Browser, along with nine other members of the Genome Browser Team: <strong>Galt Barber, Hiram Clawson, Rachel Harte, Angie Hinrichs, Donna Karolchik, Robert Kuhn, Brian Raney, Kate Rosenbloom</strong>, and <strong>Ann Zweig</strong>.</p>
<p>The 2019 list includes 6,217 highly cited researchers in various fields from nearly 60 nations. The methodology behind the list draws on the data and analysis performed by bibliometric experts from the Institute for Scientific Information at the Web of Science Group.</p>
<p>A total of 3,517 researchers are recognized for their performance in the 21 ESI fields, and 2,492 for cross-field performance, for a total of 6,009 unique researchers, as some Highly Cited Researchers appear in more than one field.</p>
<p>This is the second year that researchers with cross-field impact&#8212;those with exceptional broad performance based on high impact papers across several fields&#8212;have been identified. UC Santa Cruz researchers recognized for cross-field impact include Jin Zhang, Yichuan Ling, and Rachel Harte.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Do&#160;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Always lock your bike through the frame and wheel (rear is best).&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Lock your bike using a high quality lock.&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Lock to a permanent bike rack or a fixed object.&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Lock in a well-lit area with a lot of foot traffic and where there are other bikes.&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Always check your lock before leaving your bike to be sure you have secured it properly.&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Read all signs in the area before locking your bike.&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Consider bringing an inexpensive bike to campus. They tend to be a less likely target.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Record your bike's brand name, model, serial number, and value, as officers will need this information if your bike is stolen. Taking pictures of the bike also helps bike owners prove ownership and track stolen bikes.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Don't&#160;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Lock your bike to itself by simply locking the front wheel to the frame. A bike 'locked' like this can easily be lifted and carried away.&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Lock your bike to items that can be easily cut or that can be lifted once you've locked it.&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Lock your bike to anything illegal, such as stairway handrails.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

If your bike is stolen, and it was not registered, the chances of recovering it are drastically reduced.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Keep a lookout for your own bike. Many times people are able to find their own bikes. If you find your bike, call the police department immediately.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you happen to witness a bike theft, either by force or stealth, dial 911 immediately and inform the dispatcher where you are and what is happening. Try to remember as much as you can about the suspect for police reports. Reporting a theft helps give law enforcement, public officials, and property owners the most accurate picture of where thefts occur in our community. This will aid in prevention and enforcement efforts.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Nader Oweis, Chief of Police</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8b62f4e280727017760172d3bfe2d027"><name>grad-student-jennifer-sittler</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Physics doctoral student excited to learn about condensed matter</title><summary>Before coming to UC Santa Cruz, Jennifer Sittler worked on the Large Hadron Collider, writing code to increase the accuracy of results.</summary><start-date>1574236800000</start-date><display-name>Grad focus</display-name><path>/2019/11/grad-student-jennifer-sittler</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/11/grad-student-jennifer-sittler</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1574296548518</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1574296656341</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/11/images/sittler-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/11/images/sittler-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sittler-400px.jpg</name><display-name>sittler-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>34974</file-size><width>400</width><height>268</height></image><image-alt>Jennifer Sittler</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/11/images/sittler-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/11/images/sittler-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sittler-80px.jpg</name><display-name>sittler-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>8877</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jennifer Sittler</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Before coming to UC Santa Cruz, Jennifer Sittler worked on the Large Hadron Collider, writing code to increase the accuracy of results.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>This article is one in a series of stories that spotlight incoming graduate students and the obstacles they&#8217;ve overcome to pursue an advanced degree.</em></p>
<p>Growing up in Alpharetta, Ga., Jennifer Sittler was always interested in physics but wasn&#8217;t sure what to do about it. She wondered how gravity worked and looked up difficult problems to solve online like cryptographs.</p>
<p>Then her family got interested in the TV show <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>. &#8220;When I saw what they did,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I thought, &#8216;That&#8217;s exactly what I want to do.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sittler completed her undergraduate work at Florida State University and worked at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee. She also worked on the Large Hadron Collider, the most powerful particle collider in the world, writing code to increase the accuracy of results.</p>
<p>She came to UC Santa Cruz to learn from physics professor Sriram Shastry about condensed matter research. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited about Dr. Shastry&#8217;s research,&#8221; she said, adding that she appreciates the freedom given to students to follow their interests. Sittler also loved that the university offers the UCSC Women in Physics and Astrophysics program to promote diversity.</p>
<p>She had a difficult experience as an undergraduate dealing with prevalent sexism. She felt she was not taken seriously by both professors and students. &#8220;I felt like no matter how well I did, it was hard to get my peers to see it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Sittler also had to overcome learning disabilities in her early years in college. Once she figured out the accommodations she needed to work best, she took off, earning a 3.9 GPA while still finding time for research and volunteering.</p>
<p>After earning her doctoral degree, Sittler plans to become a professor, a completely different career path than her parents (her father works for the airlines and her mother owns a girls&#8217; birthday party business.). &#8220;My mom never heard of atoms,&#8221; she joked, adding that both parents think what she is doing is cool.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="95d1131e80727017760172d3fcdc4092"><name>investigation-of-fire-at-rcc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Investigation of fire at Rachel Carson College (Case 19-1127)</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz police are seeking the campus community’s help in the investigation of a small fire set on the second floor of a Rachel Carson College residence hall on Saturday. </summary><start-date>1574409600000</start-date><display-name>Investigation of fire at Rachel Carson College (Case 19-1127)</display-name><path>/2019/11/investigation-of-fire-at-rcc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/11/investigation-of-fire-at-rcc</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1574471537408</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1574471637604</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>UC Santa Cruz police are seeking the campus community&#8217;s help in the investigation of a small fire set on the second floor of a Rachel Carson College residence hall on Saturday. <br/><br/>Two name tags mounted on a door in Rachel Carson College B-L were set on fire around 3 a.m., causing minor damage. This incident was reported to police the evening of Nov. 21.<br/><br/>Anyone who saw anything suspicious in or around the residence hall around that time is asked to call the campus dispatch center at 831-459-2231, Ext. 1. All crimes should be reported as soon as possible to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department. Timely warnings allow the department to provide information about campus safety and to help locate those responsible. <br/><br/><strong>Safety Tips</strong><br/>

Election as a AAAS Fellow is an honor bestowed upon AAAS members by their peers.</p>
<p>Fisher was recognized for "distinguished scientific contributions to seafloor and groundwater hydrology, for service to academe and research organizations, and for innovations in freshwater management."</p>
<p>Fisher has done pioneering research in marine hydrogeology, studying how vast quantities of ocean water circulate through the seafloor, flowing through the volcanic rock of the upper oceanic crust. He has also done extensive research on groundwater, aquifers, and the management of water resources.</p>
<p>Fisher is the UCSC campus lead for the <a href="http://ucwater.org/">UC Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative</a> and for the <a href="https://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/">Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations</a>, a Science and Technology Center funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation. He has spent decades studying surface water and groundwater in the Pajaro Valley, where saltwater intrusion due to over-pumping of the aquifer is an ongoing problem. His lab has been implementing and studying groundwater recharge projects in the Pajaro Valley and other parts of California, using available surface waters to replenish depleted aquifers and improve water quality.</p>
<p>A fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and the Geological Society of America (GSA), Fisher received the GSA&#8217;s O. E. Meinzer Award in Hydrogeology. He has twice received UCSC's Excellence in Teaching Award, and he was recently selected to be a Sigma Xi Distinguished Lecturer for 2020-22. Fisher joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1995.</p>
<p>The tradition of AAAS Fellows began in 1874. This year 443 members have been awarded this honor by AAAS because of their scientifically or socially distinguished efforts to advance science or its applications. They include alumnus Richard Gordon <span>(Stevenson '75, B.A. Earth Sciences)</span>, now a professor of geophysics at Rice University.&#160; New fellows will be honored during the 2020 AAAS Annual Meeting in Seattle in February.</p>
<p>The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is the world&#8217;s largest general scientific society and the publisher of <em>Science</em> and related journals. AAAS was founded in 1848 and includes nearly 250 affiliated societies and academies of science.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a409fa3180727017760172d347278142"><name>exceptions-to-campus-closure-2019-2020</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Exceptions to campus closure 2019-2020 and power service interruption</title><summary>As in the past, the UC Santa Cruz campus will close during the holiday season in an effort to conserve energy at a time when the university business is generally slow.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">As in the past, the UC Santa Cruz&#160;campus&#160;will close during the holiday season in an effort to conserve energy at a time when the university business is generally slow. This year the&#160;campus&#160;will be&#160;closed&#160;from Tuesday, December 24, 2019 through Wednesday, January 1, 2020, re-opening on Thursday, January 2, 2020. The&#160;campus&#160;community is reminded to turn off lights, shut down computers, and other office equipment, and close and lock exterior windows before leaving for the break.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the&#160;closure&#160;some housing areas and other buildings will remain open. Laboratory buildings will be partially operational due to special needs of researchers and scientists, and some&#160;campus&#160;units' work schedules may require staffing during all or part of the&#160;closure. Fire, police, and environmental health and safety services will be provided to the&#160;campus&#160;community during this period, along with necessary utilities and other essential services&#160;(<em>for exclusions,&#160;</em><em>see power service interruption information below</em>).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;If you are required to work all or part of this&#160;closure&#160;on&#160;campus, you must receive approval from your unit head and principal officer. Once unit heads have concurrence from their principal officer, they are asked to notify&#160;Physical&#160;Plant&#160;directly of their plans to remain open or staffed during part or all of the&#160;closure&#160;on&#160;campus. Notifications should be made via email to&#160;<a href="mailto:allysonr@ucsc.edu">allysonr@ucsc.edu</a>, by&#160;campus&#160;mail to Allyson Raedeke, mailstop Physical Plant Services, or by fax 459-5121 no later than&#160;Friday, December 13, 2019, and should include the specific dates that offices will be occupied, as well as the number of occupants. This will ensure that open areas will receive necessary services during this period when most faculty, staff, and students are gone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time. Faculty is urged to announce the&#160;closure&#160;broadly to their graduate students who may plan on working throughout the&#160;closures.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you have facilities-related questions or would like further information on&#160;campus&#160;closure&#160;exceptions, please contact Allyson Raedeke at&#160;459-5561.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Power service interruption</strong><strong>&#160;December 26-30, 2019</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to reduce the campus&#8217;s carbon footprint, a two-megawatt solar parking canopy will be built at the East Remote Parking Lot. Starting&#160;7:00AM&#160;Thursday, December 26th through&#160;7:00PM&#160;Monday, December 30th, campus electricity service will be shut down to install required equipment to connect the&#160;new Solar Photovoltaic System&#160;to the campus grid and perform testing.In buildings affected by this power outage, please power down your computers, printers, equipment, etc. before 7:00AM Thursday, December 26th in preparation for this power outage. Also please note elevators will not be operational during power outage.</p>

(Infographic courtesy Peter Weiss-Penzias)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Bioaccumulation contributes to levels that approach toxic thresholds in pumas</article-subhead><article-text><p>Marine fog brings more than cooler temperatures to coastal areas. Researchers at UC Santa Cruz have discovered elevated levels of mercury in mountain lions, the latest indication that the neurotoxin is being carried in fog, deposited on the land, and making its way up the food chain.</p>
<p>Concentrations of mercury in pumas in the Santa Cruz Mountains were three times higher than lions who live outside the fog zone. Similarly, mercury levels in lichen and deer were significantly higher inside the fog belt than beyond it.</p>
<p>Mercury levels found in pumas are approaching toxic thresholds that could jeopardize reproduction and even survival, according to the researchers, whose findings appear in an article that is available free <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-54056-7">online</a>.</p>
<p>Led by Peter Weiss-Penzias, an environmental toxicologist who has pioneered the study of pollutants in coastal fog, the study is the first to trace the atmospheric source of super-toxic methylmercury in the terrestrial food web up to a top predator.</p>
<p>"Lichen don&#8217;t have any roots so the presence of elevated methylmercury in lichen must come from the atmosphere," said Weiss-Penzias. "Mercury becomes increasingly concentrated in organisms higher up the food chain."</p>
<p>Although mercury levels in fog present no health risk to humans, the risk to terrestrial mammals may be significant. With each step up the food chain, from lichen to deer to mountain lions, mercury concentrations can increase by at least 1,000 times, said Weiss-Penzias.</p>
<p>The study included fur and whisker samples from 94 coastal mountain lions and 18 noncoastal lions. Mercury concentrations in the coastal samples averaged about 1,500 parts per billion (ppb), compared to nearly 500 ppb in the noncoastal group. At least one lion studied had mercury levels known to be toxic to species like mink and otters, and two others had "sublethal" levels that reduce fertility and reproductive success.</p>
<p>Elevated concentrations of mercury present an additional potential threat to a top predator that is already coping with habitat loss and other risks posed by humans, said senior author Chris Wilmers, a professor of environmental studies and the director of the Puma Project.</p>
<p>"These mercury levels might compound the impacts of trying to make it in an environment like the Santa Cruz Mountains, where there is already so much human influence, but we don't really know," said Wilmers. "Levels will be higher 100 years from now, when the Earth's mercury budget is higher because of all the coal we're pumping into the atmosphere."</p>
<p><em><u>The source of fog-borne mercury </u></em></p>
<p>Mercury, a naturally occurring element, is released into the environment through a variety of natural processes and human activities, including mining and coal-fired power plants. "Mercury is a global pollutant," said Weiss-Penzias. "What's emitted in China can affect the United States just as much as what's emitted in the United States."</p>
<p>As atmospheric mercury rains down on oceans, it is converted by anaerobic bacteria in deep waters to methylmercury, the most toxic form of mercury. Upwelling brings some methylmercury to the surface, where it is released back into the atmosphere and carried by fog. At high concentrations, methylmercury can cause neurological damage, including memory loss and reduced motor coordination, and it can decrease the viability of offspring.</p>
<p>"Fog is a stabilizing medium for methylmercury," said Weiss-Penzias. "Fog drifts inland and rains down in microdroplets, collecting on vegetation and dripping to the ground, where the slow process of bioaccumulation begins."&#160;</p>
<p><em><u>Top predators, an international treaty, and a foggy bike ride</u></em></p>
<p>Fog is present in coastal areas that border oceans, environmental "hotspots" that are also home to high concentrations of humans. Weiss-Penzias is eager to investigate mercury levels in coastal Chile, where the top predator is a lizard, while Wilmers is curious about mercury levels in coyotes, bobcats, and birds in coastal areas.</p>
<p>"We need to protect the top predators in the environment," said Weiss-Penzias. "They're keystone species. They perform ecosystem services. When you change one thing, it has cascading effects through the system."</p>
<p>As an example of cascade effects, Wilmers cited the removal of wolves from many states in the eastern United States, which resulted in more coyotes, who preyed on foxes that had historically kept the rodent population in check. The loss of foxes ultimately made way for more rodents, which help transmit Lyme disease, said Wilmers, who added, "Locally, potentially, mountain lions keep deer and small predators in check, which could reduce Lyme disease."</p>
<p>The global effort to protect humans and the environment from mercury includes the Minamata Convention on Mercury, an international treaty that was adopted in 2013. Named after a Japanese city that endured a dire incident of mercury poisoning, the treaty is broad in scope, encompassing the entire life cycle of mercury.</p>
<p>"It's important for the future of that treaty to understand all the different ways that mercury impacts the environment," said Weiss-Penzias.</p>
<p>As an atmospheric chemist, Weiss-Penzias said he first became curious about fog-borne pollutants about a decade ago while riding his bike to work. "I was riding through this absolute fogstorm, with water dripping off my glasses, and I just wondered, 'What's in this stuff?'" he recalled. Hypothesizing that mercury might de-gas out of the ocean and end up in fog, he collected samples and sent them to a lab.</p>
<p>"The lab called me, saying they'd have to re-run the tests, because they didn't believe the numbers," said Weiss-Penzias.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a90d14e880727017760172d30deabf2e"><name>keynote-giving-tuesday</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Giving Tuesday to support student basic needs</title><summary>The fall quarter is sprinting toward its finish, some desperately needed rain is on the horizon, and soon we will all have a short break from our work and studies, hopefully to spend time with family and friends.&#13;

<p>I, for one, am especially grateful to be part of a campus community so dedicated to making a difference in the lives of students and in the world around us. Our collective efforts to change the world for the better continually inspire me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to highlight an initiative designed to strengthen our efforts to combat food insecurity and to further raise awareness of the issue. We are planning a special edition of <a href="https://givingtuesday.ucsc.edu">Giving Tuesday</a>, which is the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. It falls on Dec. 3 this year. This day has become an international day of charitable giving, and UCSC will route all the money we raise to our Slug Support program.

One focus of his work in recent years has been to improve the monitoring technology available to detect when algal toxins are appearing in coastal waters. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Two new grants from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are funding ongoing efforts by Kudela and his collaborators to develop technology that can detect a broad range of algal toxins. Toxins that were not previously considered a problem on the West Coast are beginning to appear at dangerously high levels in California shellfish, Kudela said.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>"We are increasingly recognizing that the West Coast is not immune to numerous harmful algal bloom issues besides the traditional ones that get most of the attention," he said. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Not all algae produce toxins or other harmful effects, but certain species have become notorious for their devastating effects on California's coastal fisheries and wildlife. Domoic acid, a potent neurotoxin produced by a type of algae called <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em>, has caused major disruptions of the Dungeness crab fishery in recent years, in addition to poisoning seabirds, sea lions, and other wildlife. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Algal toxins like domoic acid enter the food chain when filter-feeding organisms such as shellfish and sardines, or bottom feeders like crabs, consume the algae and accumulate the toxin in their tissues. State monitoring programs and annual closures of commercial and recreational fisheries are designed to prevent human exposure to these toxins.</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Toxin tracking</strong></p>
<p><span>Historically, monitoring for toxins has relied on strings of mussels deployed at sites along the coast and regularly harvested, ground up, and analyzed to gauge toxin levels. Kudela and his team are now testing a new monitoring technology in four different California coastal environments. Known as Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT), the new technology uses small resin beads held inside a tea bag-like apparatus. The beads act like tiny sponges, soaking up all kinds of toxins from the water. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The SPATT devices are hung in the water and collected at regular intervals for analysis. The resin beads are analyzed in a lab using a mass spectrometer to identify which toxins, if any, were present and at what levels. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>While promising, the new SPATT technology provides data in a different form than the traditional mussel monitoring. "The management agencies are having difficulties comparing the toxin levels found in the resin to the toxin levels found in shellfish," Kudela said. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The new NOAA grants include a project led by Kudela to conduct a five-year comparative study of the two methods. His hope is to develop a coefficient of sorts, allowing the SPATT results to be converted into a scale similar to what management agencies currently use to track toxin levels.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Kudela also wants to use the SPATT technology to monitor for a wider range of toxins than the ones agencies have traditionally focused on. In a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/03/sfbay-toxins.html">2018 study</a>, Kudela's lab found four different algal toxins in mussels collected from San Francisco Bay. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>"That caught people's attention," he said, noting that there appear to be more toxins in California's coastal waters than are currently being detected by routine monitoring.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The second NOAA-funded project, led by Christopher Gobler of Stony Brook University, focuses on using SPATT technology to detect and monitor one of those emerging threats. Microcystins are toxins produced by freshwater algae (cyanobacteria) that can cause liver damage in people and animals. Research by Kudela and others has shown that these freshwater toxins are entering coastal waters and accumulating in shellfish. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Once the SPATT technology has been calibrated, Kudela said he expects management groups such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to begin developing new guidelines for microcystins. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>"Right now, there are no guidelines about freshwater toxins in the marine environment," he said. SPATT can be used to quantify toxin levels in the water and provide data needed for the development of guidelines that can prevent human exposure to the toxins.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Harmful algal blooms have been associated with warmer ocean temperatures and high nutrient levels in the water. In 2015, when an oceanic heat wave dubbed the "warm blob" spanned the coast from California to Alaska, an unprecedented bloom of toxic algae caused losses of over $90 million in the shellfish and crab industries. With another oceanic heat wave beginning to form in the Pacific Northwest this year, the possibility of another catastrophic harmful algal bloom looms on the horizon. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Since that 2015 event, Kudela and other scientists have been working together and sharing information on ocean conditions and harmful algal blooms. Through this collaboration, they hope to better understand what the future holds for our coastal waters. For this year, strong winter storms could still mix up the warm surface waters and alleviate the threat of another super bloom, Kudela said. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>"At this point in the season, we're all just waiting to see what happens," he said. </span><span></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="bda1ae1a807270172739340fad9c435a"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2019/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/11/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1545074748939</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1545074748939</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
