<p>TAPS will give highest priority to providing Disability Van Service (DVS) clients transport between on-campus locations while suspending the Bike Shuttle and regular Loop and Upper Campus shuttle services.<br/><br/>Depending on the number of drivers that report to work, TAPS may be able to run a minimal level of shuttle service, and a limited number of smaller, volunteer-based vehicles will be on-hand to supplement this service. Other options include Lyft, Uber, Zipcars, JUMP bikes, providing or sharing a ride with a friend or connecting with someone through Zimride, biking, or walking when able.<br/><br/>We anticipate that METRO routes serving the campus will drop passengers off at the base of campus only and will then detour around the Bay/High intersection, with buses laying-over on Meder and Cardiff streets to maintain their regular service schedules.</p>

<p>Last month, the Board of Regents approved the renewal of Kresge College and Student Housing West.</p>
<p>Both projects are focused on supporting the needs of current UC Santa Cruz students. The <a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/">Kresge College renewal</a> aims to update the residential college through a mix of new construction and renovation to meet the needs of today&#8217;s student body. The college was constructed in 1973.</p>
<p>Student Housing West will create 3,072 new beds at two sites, one along Heller Drive, the other along Hagar Drive. Additionally, it will provide a new childcare facility that will be able to extend service to the children of faculty and staff, in addition to students.</p>
<p>The campus published <a href="https://ppc.ucsc.edu/planning/EnvDoc.html">final environmental impact reports</a> for both the Kresge and Student Housing West projects at the end of February.&#160;</p>
<h3>Kresge renewal</h3>
<p>Of Kresge&#8217;s 21 existing buildings, 11 will be renovated and rebuilt. Others will be removed to make way for new viewsheds, commons, gathering spaces, and accessibility features, including a &#8220;stramp&#8221; (a hybrid staircase and ramp) for improved accessibility. Buildings will be renovated to help the campus group together different services offered through the college.</p>
<p>Plans for the north section of the Kresge campus would include new and larger residence hall accommodations; a new academic plaza and academic facility; the Kresge provost&#8217;s offices and classrooms, including a 600-seat lecture hall, which would become the largest of its kind on campus; a 150-seat lecture hall; and 50- and 35-seat classrooms. A 48-seat computing lab is also included.</p>
<h3>Student Housing West</h3>
<p>The plan to build at the two sites&#8212;along Heller and at the intersection of Hagar and Coolidge&#8212;has been identified as the approach that will develop additional housing in a timely fashion, incorporate adequate support space for students and residential life staff, minimize displacement impacts on students with families, and provide affordable housing, which is particularly important given that the ultimate cost of building and maintaining housing is borne by students.</p>
<p>The Hagar site would be home to a new childcare facility that will serve the children of faculty and staff in addition to students, as well as 140 units for Family Student Housing.</p>
<p>While the committee expressed broad support for the project as a whole, some referenced correspondence from members of the UC Santa Cruz community opposing development on part of the campus&#8217;s East Meadow, while others&#8212;citing the pressing need for more housing in campus&#8212;voiced strong support for the proposal as it stands now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing would make me happier than to find a solution that is cost-effective for students and which satisfy those who would like to preserve the East Meadow and not build 140 units there,&#8221; said Chancellor George Blumenthal, addressing the committee at its March meeting. &#8220;(But) if there were a simple solution, we would have brought it to you already.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blumenthal pointed out that campus administration, in addition to the seven alternatives previously introduced, also considered five additional alternative proposals since the Regents meeting in January. None of which meet all the project objectives. He said the cheapest alternative would add millions of dollars to the project cost, and that increase would be reflected in higher rental fees for students, which is inconsistent with the objective of supporting &#8220;the development of sufficient and affordable, on-campus student housing under the UC President&#8217;s Housing Initiative.&#8221; Moreover, many of the alternatives also failed to provide on-campus housing in a timely fashion and minimize displacement impacts on students with families.</p>
<p>Though UC Santa Cruz provides housing for 9,300 students&#8212;roughly half of its student body&#8212;there remains an urgent need for affordable campus housing, especially for upper-division students who otherwise would be living in the surrounding community. Student Housing West is the single largest housing project underway in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>Regents also had a discussion of the campus&#8217;s plan to rebuild University House and Event Center and asked the campus to find a way to significantly reduce the project&#8217;s cost. <br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="de8d14768072701734bebd3c815dbb9e"><name>postdoc-symposium</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>STEM Postdoc Symposium features a public poster session on April 24</title><summary>Annual symposium highlights research from early career scientists at UC Santa Cruz.</summary><start-date>1554188400000</start-date><display-name>STEM Postdoc Symposium features a public poster session on April 24</display-name><path>/2019/04/postdoc-symposium</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/postdoc-symposium</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1554216980834</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1554217162622</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/uspa-logo-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/uspa-logo-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>uspa-logo-410.jpg</name><display-name>uspa-logo-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>47431</file-size><width>410</width><height>127</height></image><image-alt>USPA logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/uspa-logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/uspa-logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>uspa-logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>uspa-logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26411</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>USPA logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Annual symposium highlights research from early career scientists at UC Santa Cruz</article-subhead><article-text><p>The <a href="http://uspa.ucsc.edu/symposium">UCSC STEM Postdoc Symposium</a> on Wednesday, April 24, will include a public reception featuring poster presentations by early career scientists at UC Santa Cruz.

<br/>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.656; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Our campus received notice last Friday that there will be a labor strike from &#160;midnight to 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, April 10by AFSCME service (SX), patient care technical (EX), and skilled trades (K7) workers. &#160;Additional bargaining units, healthcare professionals, research support professionals, and technical employees will be joining the strike in sympathy. In advance of this scheduled strike activity, we write to share some information and resources that you may find helpful.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.656; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; background-color: #ffffff;">&#160;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.656; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The university is committed to ensuring that all people may exercise the constitutionally protected rights of free expression, speech, and assembly. The ongoing opportunity for the expression of a variety of viewpoints is at the core of this commitment. The right of free speech in a university includes the right to acts of peaceful dissent, protests in peaceable assembly, and orderly demonstrations which include picketing.</span></p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.656; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It is equally important to know that these rights are subject to restrictions based on time, place, and manner rules. For example, UC policy does not allow free expression to disrupt the regular and essential operations of the university, to significantly infringe on the rights of others, or to block or impede ingress to or egress from the campus or buildings. When free expression disrupts our ability to offer classes, administer exams, carry on research, or run the university in general&#8212;or when it violates university policy or the law in any way&#8212;then it may be subject to disciplinary consequences.</span></p>

Unions are legally prohibited from threatening or coercing members in other ways to keep them from coming to work. Staff members should remain in contact with their supervisors and managers to discuss their schedules and work locations.</span></p>

In cases of emergency, please dial 9-1-1.</span></p>

TAPS Transit Operations will give highest priority to providing Disability Van Service (DVS) clients transport between on-campus locations while suspending the Bike Shuttle and regular Loop and Upper Campus shuttle services. Santa Cruz Metro buses typically do not enter campus during strikes; however, they generally drop-off and pick-up riders at the base of campus.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who attend UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s upcoming </span><a href="https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Weekend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> April 26&#8211;28 can immerse themselves in cutting-edge science and get to the heart of innovative learning techniques during two special Saturday afternoon events on campus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning Slugs can take in a fascinating series of talks about &#8220;</span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/high_impact_science_from_pbsci#.XIAbDC2ZPq0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-impact science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; from 1:30&#8211;4 p.m. on Saturday, April 27. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event, featuring an all-star group of UC Santa Cruz physical and biological sciences faculty who are also alumni, will take place at the Physical Sciences Building on Science Hill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the presenters are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Natalie Batalha </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ph.D. &#8216;97, astrophysics), winner of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 2018 Alumni Achievement Award, who will talk about &#8220;Earth and the cosmos&#8221; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology </span><strong>Kristy Kroeker</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Crown &#8216;01, marine biology), who will discuss &#8220;life and the environment&#8221; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant professor of MCD biology </span><strong>Olena Morozova Vaske</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (postdoc, 2013&#8211;2016, biomolecular engineering), who will bring the audience up-to-date on &#8220;next-generation medicine&#8221; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Aura Alegra Eroy-Reveles</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Ph.D. '08, chemistry), who will discuss science &#8220;teaching techniques for today&#8221;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;High-impact science at Alumni Weekend will explore the latest scientific advancements and research coming out of UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Ryan Kallabis, assistant communications director of physical and biological sciences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Topics range from the fundamental forces that shape our Earth and the cosmos, biochemical interactions that lead to next-generation medicine, emergent effects that impact life and environmental change, as well as new science teaching techniques for today&#8217;s students. Talks will be followed by a reception featuring refreshments and recognitions of achievements by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s departments, programs, and students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also on that Saturday afternoon, </span><a href="https://literature.ucsc.edu/faculty/singleton.php?&amp;singleton=true&amp;cruz_id=jgreene"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jody Greene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, professor of literature, feminist studies, and history of consciousness, and director of the Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (CITL), will lead a team of faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates in an &#160;eye-opening discussion about &#8220;</span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/jody-greene-radical-learning-heart-uc-santa-cruz-experience/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radical Learning&#8212;the Heart of the UC Santa Cruz Experience.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; The event takes place from 2&#8211;3 p.m. Saturday at the Humanities Lecture Hall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene is &#160;excited about this event. &#8220;I want people to know about all the changes we are making here in the classroom,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have seen more changes on this campus in the past two years than during the previous 18. Things are really moving along.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At CITL, we are bringing research methods and cognitive science about how people learn, as well as social and behavioral science, to study conditions in which students can learn,&#8221; Greene explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science is helping professors figure out who is and who is not learning. The result, she said, is more dynamic teaching methods: &#8220;What is happening in higher education right now is a revolution to a learning-centered approach to education.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This event will also be a great way for attendants to understand the bold educational vision of UC Santa Cruz since its inception, while introducing alumni to the innovative 21st-century approaches the campus is taking to ensure all students can thrive at UC Santa Cruz and leave with the tools to make change in society, Greene said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene and her fellow presenters will emphasize the university&#8217;s history of active and activist teaching methods, its commitment to an education grounded in social justice, its ahead-of-the-times choice to have no grades and interdisciplinary departments, and its unique status as the only public research university in the country that was also founded as a kind of &#8220;alternative school.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event will include prominent learning scientists as well as undergraduates working on projects related to improving student learning. Participants will give lightning talks on what it takes for students to be outstanding learners in our 21st-century university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The talk will be presented by the Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning, the academic working group on Advancing Learning Sciences for a New Generation, and the Student Success Equity Research Center at UC Santa Cruz. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e03a3b918072701734bebd3c7fbe85a8"><name>coral-nitrogen</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Coral study traces excess nitrogen to Maui wastewater treatment facility</title><summary>Nutrient pollution has been blamed for algal blooms and degradation of coral reefs along Maui's west coast.</summary><keywords>Adina Paytan</keywords><start-date>1554292800000</start-date><display-name>Coral study traces excess nitrogen to Maui wastewater treatment facility</display-name><path>/2019/04/coral-nitrogen</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/coral-nitrogen</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1554245105755</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1554303431923</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/submarine-seep-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/submarine-seep-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>submarine-seep-400.jpg</name><display-name>submarine-seep-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>101297</file-size><width>400</width><height>299</height></image><image-alt>freshwater seep</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/submarine-seep-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/submarine-seep-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>submarine-seep-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>submarine-seep-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24163</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>freshwater seep</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Groundwater carrying excess nutrients from treated sewage enters coastal waters through submarine freshwater seeps in the reef off the coast of Maui.

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Algal blooms and degradation of coral reefs along Maui's coast have been attributed to nutrient pollution, and previous studies have suggested the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility is a major source of excess nutrients in coastal waters. Previous experiments using dye tracers showed a direct link between the facility's injection site and small submarine seeps that discharge freshwater near the coral reefs. But there are many potential sources of nitrogen, and it has been hard to show that the excess nitrogen in the water comes from the treatment plant. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"They didn't have a smoking gun to say that the nitrogen came from the sewage," said Adina Paytan, a research professor in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Paytan and UCSC graduate student Joseph Murray worked with U.S. Geological Survey researchers Nancy Prouty and Sara Peek on the new study, published April 3 in </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Scientific Reports</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"While submarine groundwater discharge is a natural process, humans are altering the composition of the water, making the reefs vulnerable to activities we do on land," Prouty said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The researchers developed a procedure for analyzing nitrogen isotopes incorporated into the crystal structure of coral skeletons. Corals lay down new skeleton material in layers that can be seen in cross-section and dated like tree rings. This enabled the researchers to correlate changes in nitrogen isotopes in the corals with changes in the operations of the wastewater facility. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In addition to the implications for addressing nutrient pollution in Maui, the new findings demonstrate the power of this technique for tracking historical changes in nutrients in seawater. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"It's a very accurate and high-resolution way to record past nutrient pollution in seawater, which is a huge problem globally," Paytan said. "It opens up a lot of possibilities for looking at historic nitrogen pollution and other changes in nitrogen sources over time. And you don't have to use coral--you could also use clam shells, for example."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In Maui, the researchers collected cores from corals at sites near the submarine seeps. Their analysis provided a 40-year record of nitrogen isotopes incorporated into the coral skeletons. The results showed a dramatic change in the isotopes after 1995, corresponding with the implementation of a biological nutrient removal process at the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Paytan explained that the nutrient removal process preferentially removes lighter isotopes of nitrogen, so the remaining nitrogen is enriched in the heavier nitrogen-15 isotope. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"There is no other process that would result in this signature, so it has to be from the sewage," she said. "Even though the treatment process removes some of the nitrogen, there is so much in the sewage that there is still a lot left, and when they inject it into the groundwater it ends up in coastal waters."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In February, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case involving the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility and the Clean Water Act, with potentially far-reaching implications for federal environmental protections.</span></p>

Today we received the final stamp of approval needed to proceed with Student Housing West, our proposal to build roughly 3,000 additional and affordable beds on campus.&#160;<br/><br/>The University of California Board of Regents has actually signed off on two large-scale capital projects for campus: Student Housing West and our plan to revitalize Kresge College. The two projects are part of an integrated strategy to provide new and additional campus housing. I believe that together these projects significantly brighten UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s future.<br/><br/>Student Housing West &#8212; at two sites, one along Heller Drive, the other along Hagar &#8212; is crucial in that it will give us more than 3,000 additional on-campus beds. It will bring upper-division students now in the local housing market back to campus, offering them safe, more affordable housing. It will relieve pressure on the greater local housing market and allow us to ease overcrowding in existing dorms by restoring some of the lounge space we have converted to sleeping space in recent years to meet serious need. Student Housing West also expands much-needed child care on campus, enabling us to once again offer faculty and staff what is now only available to our students with children.&#160;<br/><br/>Student Housing West has critics. Some believe a small slice of meadow the project will occupy should remain untouched. I sympathize with their desire to keep things as they are, but I strongly believe this is the right project, in the right place, at the right time. California is in the grips of a severe housing crisis. In our own community there is an extreme lack of housing, and what is available is prohibitively expensive. Too many of our students are struggling to get by in this irrational housing market, and Student Housing West is our attempt to help them.<br/><br/>The Kresge College renewal is another vital piece of our future. The approval allows us to move forward with a plan to preserve and upgrade some beloved landmarks, which are fast-approaching 50 years old, integrating them with new facilities including residence halls, classrooms, lecture halls, and programmatic buildings. The project will allow us to better meet the needs of today&#8217;s student body, while safeguarding the college&#8217;s historic elements.<br/><br/>In my 47 years on campus, I can&#8217;t recall two projects of this scope and vision being given the green light at the same meeting. This is an extremely positive development for our campus, aiding students, staff, and faculty, and I am delighted we&#8217;ve been given the go-ahead.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e0844f9d8072701734bebd3c05632368"><name>walsh-japan</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Carl Walsh appointed honorary adviser to Bank of Japan’s Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies</title><summary>UCSC Distinguished Professor of Economics Carl Walsh has been appointed to serve as an honorary adviser to the Bank of Japan’s Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies. </summary><start-date>1554188400000</start-date><display-name>Walsh-Japan</display-name><path>/2019/04/walsh-japan</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/walsh-japan</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1554249960560</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1554249960560</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/carl-walsh.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/carl-walsh.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>carl-walsh.jpg</name><display-name>carl-walsh.jpg</display-name><file-size>15760</file-size><width>280</width><height>336</height></image><image-alt>Head shot of Carl Walsh</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/walsh-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/walsh-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>walsh-80.jpg</name><display-name>walsh-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>3070</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Head shot of Carl Walsh</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC Distinguished Professor of Economics Carl Walsh has been appointed to serve as an honorary adviser to the Bank of Japan&#8217;s Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies (IMES).</p>

<p>Raskatov was also awarded the 2018 <a href="https://boulderpeptide.org/2018/08/06/jevgenij-raskatov-receives-the-young-investigator-award/">Young Investigator Award</a> of the Boulder Peptide Society, established to support promising peptide scientists during the pre-tenure period.</p>
<p>Raskatov's research focuses on a peptide involved in Alzheimer's disease known as amyloid beta. Amyloid beta clumps together into sticky fibrils that form deposits in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. Researchers have found that "oligomers" consisting of a few amyloid beta peptides seem to be more toxic to brain cells than the large, insoluble fibers. Raskatov's team has identified features of amyloid beta that influence the aggregation of the peptide, including alterations that can suppress the formation of toxic oligomers.</p>
<p>The Young Investigator Award was given to Raskatov in September at the Boulder Peptide Symposium, where he gave a presentation on his research. As a recipient of the APS Early Career Lectureship, Raskatov will give a talk at the American Peptide Symposium June 22 to 27 in Monterey.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://youtu.be/dXZc9akaXGA</url><title>VIDEO: Young Investigator lecture at Boulder Peptide Symposium</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ea1d83d28072701734bebd3c6f5b8967"><name>proposed-research-policies</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus review of newly proposed research policies</title><summary>The policies establish clear and uniform allocation of income derived from intellectual property related to institutional work at UC Santa Cruz and support the IATC mission to build a vibrant, entrepreneurial culture to accelerate the adoption of inventions, cultivate sustainable strategic partnerships, and enable our campus to be an innovation powerhouse delivering social and economic benefits to our local and global communities.</summary><start-date>1554793200000</start-date><display-name>Proposed policies</display-name><path>/2019/04/proposed-research-policies</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/proposed-research-policies</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1554410995866</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1554410995866</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Office of Research is pleased to invite comments on the following newly proposed policies:</p>

<p>As a final community update on this incident, please be advised that asbestos abatement from the construction-related contamination at Cowell and Stevenson colleges has been completed. PPDO and EH&amp;S inspected 295 rooms or areas in which the contractor had worked. Of these, 35 were found to have minor dust and debris from the construction activities, while one area was found to have major dust and debris (greater than three square feet, per regulatory criteria).</p>
<p>All rooms found to contain dust and debris from the contractor were cleaned per regulatory standards, including HEPA-filtered vacuuming and surface wiping. Air samples were then collected in these rooms to verify that airborne asbestos concentrations were below the conservative criteria set for public K&#8211;12 schools. All air sample results were well below regulatory criteria.</p>
<p>In almost all areas, the plastic containment used during the cleaning process has been removed, restricted occupancy tags have been removed, and locks returned to their original keys (where applicable). The remaining areas, the Cowell dining hall and Stevenson event center, are expected to be released for resumption of regular activities early next week.</p>
<p><strong>Dining Services will require several days to prepare the Cowell dining hall and Stevenson coffee shop for regular service. At this time, service is expected to resume on Thursday, April 11.</strong></p>

<p>A biography of two of the most famous artist couples of the era, it follows the careers of Alfred Stieglitz, Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe, Paul Strand, and Rebecca Salsbury as they made a &#8216;quiet challenge to those who refused to see photography as art.&#8217;</p>
<p>Offering insight into an important period in American art, the book ranges from Stieglitz&#8217;s controversial 1921 New York exhibition, featuring his works of an unidentified nude, to time spent in Taos, New Mexico, where the foursome became an integral part of the town&#8217;s art scene.</p>
<p>Just published by Knopf in March, the 432-page book includes 43 black and white, plus 24 color, illustrations.</p>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> described it as a &#8220;fascinating, well-told history,&#8221; adding that the book is based largely on recently available correspondence among the four artists.</p>
<p>In an article titled &#8220;Five Hot Books,&#8221; <em>The National Review </em>noted:&#160;</p>
<p>"In her deeply researched and richly imagined book, Burke focuses on two marriages in a way that amplifies the personal and artistic lives of a quartet of painters and photographers and magnifies their powerful influence on 20th-century art&#8211;and on one another...Burke, reflecting her deep insight into these vastly creative artists, makes ingenious connections in their correspondence and art that powerfully demonstrate that even while plagued by tensions and rivalries, they elevated one another&#8217;s work."</p>
<p>Burke&#8217;s previous book<em> Lee Milller, A Life</em>, was a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book of the Year in 2006. A biography of the iconic <em>Vogue</em> model turned World War II photojournalist, it was also a finalist for The National Book Critics Circle Award.</p>
<p>Burke is additionally the author of <em>No Regrets: The Life of Edith Piaf</em> and <em>Becoming Modern: The Life of Mina Loy.</em></p>
<p>A biographer, art critic, and translator, Burke has taught at UC Santa Cruz, Princeton, and UC Davis; at the Universities of Western Sydney and New South Wales in Australia; and at the Sorbonne and the University of Lille in France.</p>
<p>Her writing has additionally appeared in such venues as <em>Art in America, Vogue, La Nouvelle Revue Francaise</em>, and <em>The New Yorker</em>.</p>
<p>Burke will discuss her new book on April 10 at The Commonwealth Club of San Francisco.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ee5c38ab8072701734bebd3c98bc285d"><name>new-genus-zehria</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New genus of marine organisms named in honor of ocean scientist Jon Zehr</title><summary>A newly described genus of marine microorganisms has been named in honor of Professor of Ocean Sciences Jonathan Zehr.</summary><start-date>1554447600000</start-date><display-name>New genus of marine organisms named in honor of ocean scientist Jon Zehr</display-name><path>/2019/04/new-genus-zehria</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/new-genus-zehria</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1554482214288</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1554482676741</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/zehr-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/zehr-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zehr-400px.jpg</name><display-name>zehr-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>132251</file-size><width>400</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Jonathan Zehr</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/zehr-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/zehr-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zehr-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>zehr-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15217</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jonathan Zehr</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jonathan Zehr</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/zehria-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/zehria-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zehria-300.jpg</name><display-name>zehria-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>26159</file-size><width>300</width><height>231</height></image><image-alt>Zehria floridana cells under microscope</image-alt><image-caption><em>Zehria floridana</em>, a newly described genus and species of cyanobacteria. (Image credit: Mares et al., 2019)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A newly described genus of marine microorganisms has been named in honor of Jonathan Zehr, a professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz who has spent most of his career studying these types of microbes and their role in ocean ecosystems.</p>
<p>The new genus, <em>Zehria</em>, is described in a paper, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpy.12853">published March 4 in the <em>Journal of Phycology</em></a>, that sorts out the taxonomy of an important group of marine cyanobacteria, including species that play a crucial role in fertilizing the oceans by "fixing" nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form usable by other organisms.</p>
<p>"It's nice to have my name associated with this group of organisms because I've spent so much of my career working on them," Zehr said. "I've been telling people I won't need to have a gravestone now."</p>
<p>Zehr is not a taxonomist himself, but he knew the senior author of the paper, Jeffrey Johansen at John Carroll University in Cleveland. "I called him after I found out, and he reminded me that I'd helped him out as a graduate student when he asked for some advice," said Zehr, who sent Johansen a couple of bottles of wine to thank him for the honor.</p>
<p>Zehr's research has focused on an unusual cyanobacterium that is among the most widespread nitrogen-fixing organisms in the oceans. Known as UCYN-A, this organism has not been formally named because it cannot be grown in culture. Zehr's group first discovered it in the open ocean near Hawaii and has since found it as far north as the Arctic. His research has also shown that UCYN-A lives in a close symbiosis with a small, single-celled algae.</p>
<p>The new genus <em>Zehria</em> is related to the organisms Zehr studies and includes the species <em>Zehria floridana</em>, isolated from mangroves on the coast of Florida, and other strains isolated near Singapore.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fd9a7a418072701734bebd3c95fa3714"><name>iron-volcanoes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Iron volcanoes may have erupted on metal asteroids</title><summary>NASA's upcoming mission to the asteroid Psyche could look for signs of past eruptions, and evidence of 'ferrovolcanism' may also turn up in iron meteorites.</summary><keywords>Francis Nimmo</keywords><start-date>1554706800000</start-date><display-name>Iron volcanoes may have erupted on metal asteroids</display-name><path>/2019/04/iron-volcanoes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/iron-volcanoes</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1554737952534</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1556741436642</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/metal-asteroid-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/metal-asteroid-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>metal-asteroid-450.jpg</name><display-name>metal-asteroid-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>80109</file-size><width>450</width><height>363</height></image><image-alt>illustration of volcanoes on metal asteroid</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/metal-asteroid-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/metal-asteroid-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>metal-asteroid-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>metal-asteroid-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16321</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>illustration of volcanoes on metal asteroid</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>As a metallic asteroid such as Psyche cooled and solidified, iron volcanoes may have erupted onto its surface.

As if that's not strange enough, scientists now think that as the metal cooled and solidified, volcanoes spewing liquid iron could have erupted through a solid iron crust onto the surface of the asteroid.</p>
<p>This scenario emerged from an analysis by planetary scientists at UC Santa Cruz whose investigation was prompted in part by NASA's plans to launch a probe to Psyche, the largest metallic asteroid in the solar system. Francis Nimmo, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, said he was interested in the composition of metallic asteroids indicated by analyses of iron meteorites, so he had graduate student Jacob Abrahams work on some simple models of how the asteroids cooled and solidified.</p>
<p>"One day he turned to me and said, 'I think these things are going to erupt,'" Nimmo said. "I'd never thought about it before, but it makes sense because you have a buoyant liquid beneath a dense crust, so the liquid wants to come up to the top."</p>
<p>The researchers described their findings in a paper that has been accepted for publication in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em> and is <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/&#126;janabrah/ferrovolcanism">available online</a>.</p>
<p>Metallic asteroids originated early in the history of the solar system when planets were beginning to form. A protoplanet or "planetesimal" involved in a catastrophic collision could be stripped of its rocky outer layers, exposing a molten, iron-rich core. In the cold of space, this blob of liquid metal would quickly begin to cool and solidify.</p>
<p>"In some cases it would crystallize from the center out and wouldn't have volcanism, but some would crystallize from the top down, so you'd get a solid sheet of metal on the surface with liquid metal underneath," Nimmo said.</p>
<p>As for what the iron volcanoes would look like, Abrahams said it depends on the composition of the melt. "If it's mostly pure iron, then you would have eruptions of low-viscosity surface flows spreading out in thin sheets, so nothing like the thick, viscous lava flows you see on Hawaii," he said. "At the other extreme, if there are light elements mixed in and gases that expand rapidly, you could have explosive volcanism that might leave pits in the surface."</p>
<p>NASA's Psyche mission is scheduled to launch in 2022 and reach the asteroid in 2026. Signs of past volcanism that researchers could look for include variations in the color or composition of material on the surface, and possibly features that look like volcanic vents. Large volcanic cones are probably unlikely, Abrahams said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because metallic asteroids would have solidified fairly quickly after their formation, there has been plenty of time (billions of years) for any surface features of volcanism to be degraded. "It's not clear what they might look like now," Abrahams said.</p>
<p>The best opportunity to find evidence of ferrovolcanism on metallic asteroids might actually come from studying iron meteorites already in collections on Earth, the researchers said.</p>
<p>"There are lots of these metallic meteorites, and now that we know what we're looking for, we might find evidence of volcanism in them," Nimmo said. "If material got erupted onto the surface, it would cool very fast, which would be reflected in the composition of the meteorite. And it might have holes in it left by escaping gas."</p>
<p>When they <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2019/pdf/1598.pdf">presented their findings at a recent Lunar and Planetary Science Conference</a>, Abrahams and Nimmo discovered that <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2019/pdf/1625.pdf">another research team</a> had independently arrived at similar conclusions about the possibility of ferrovolcanism.</p>
<p>"It's not a shocking idea, but we'd just never thought about iron volcanism before, so it's something new and interesting to investigate," Abrahams said.</p>
<p>This research was supported in part by NASA.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="febcd5f48072701734bebd3c3e3791e9"><name>burglaries-on-campus</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>On-campus burglaries</title><summary>Campus residents are urged to be vigilant after a spate of residential burglaries on campus over the past two weeks and to let campus police know immediately if they see anything suspicious or suspect their room or apartment may have been burglarized. </summary><start-date>1554274800000</start-date><display-name>On-campus burglaries </display-name><path>/2019/04/burglaries-on-campus</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/burglaries-on-campus</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1554756981443</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1554756981443</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div dir="ltr">Campus residents are urged to be vigilant after a spate of residential burglaries on campus over the past two weeks and to let campus police know immediately if they see anything suspicious or suspect their room or apartment may have been burglarized.&#160;</div>

<div dir="ltr">On March 31, the residents of a Kresge College apartment reported their residence had been broken into during the previous week, possibly through a pried-open window. It was unknown what, if anything, was taken.&#160;</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr">On March 26, a computer, an Xbox, and a camera were stolen from a Porter College residence hall. The thief gained access through a window.</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr">Also in the final week of March, someone stole a debit card from the top of a dresser in a Porter College residence hall. The victim and her roommates were out of town, but were alerted to the break-in when someone used the card illegally.</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr">It is unknown if these crimes are related. Anyone who may have witnessed something suspicious or who has information regarding these crimes is encouraged to call the UC Santa Cruz Police Department at 831-459-2231, ext. 1</div>

The labor action is expected to run all-day Wednesday, from midnight to 11:59 p.m.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>Though we do not know how these strike activities will impact the operation of our campus, university officials are working to do everything they can to ensure services continue.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Academic activities</strong></div>
<div>The campus expects to hold all classes, discussion sections, labs, and office hours as normal.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>Students should be in communication with their instructors about contingency plans in the event campus is inaccessible.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>It is strongly recommended that everyone allow for additional time to get to their destination, given that transportation service is an area that will be impacted.</div>
<div><strong>&#160;</strong></div>
<div><strong>Transportation</strong></div>
<div>TAPS will give highest priority to providing Disability Van Service clients transport between on-campus locations while suspending the Bike Shuttle and regular Loop and Upper Campus shuttle services.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Depending on the number of drivers who report to work, TAPS may be able to run a minimal level of shuttle service, and a limited number of smaller, volunteer-based vehicles will be on-hand to supplement this service. Other options include Lyft, Uber, <a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/commute-options/zipcar.html">Zipcars</a>, <a href="https://jump.com/cities/santa-cruz/">JUMP bikes</a>, providing or sharing a ride with a friend, or connecting with someone through <a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/commute-options/zimride.html">Zimride</a>, biking, or walking when able.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>Those planning to use Lyft, Uber, Zipcars, JUMP Bikes, or Zimrides should sign up for the service in advance.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We anticipate METRO routes serving campus will drop passengers off at the base of campus only, then detour around the Bay/High intersection, with buses laying-over on Meder and Cardiff streets to maintain regular service schedules.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Dining</strong></div>
<div>Provided sufficient staffing is available, up to three dining halls will be open during the strike; however, dining hall hours will be limited from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and the types of prepared food available will be limited as well. We also anticipate that all cafes and restaurants operated by UC Santa Cruz Dining may be closed.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Stay informed</strong></div>
<div>The campus will provide real-time updates beginning early Wednesday at <a href="http://ucsc.edu/status">ucsc.edu/status</a>. Information will also be shared through 459-INFO and on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/ucsc">twitter.com/ucsc</a>. <a href="https://oes.ucsc.edu/cruzalert/">CruzAlerts</a> may also be used when appropriate.</div>

<p>Finding a fawn (baby&#160;deer) alone in the woods or a meadow is fairly common. Many people assume that young wildlife found alone are abandoned, helpless and need assistance for their survival. In nearly all cases this is a mistake, and typically human interaction does more damage than good. If you see a fawn or other newborn wildlife, enjoy your encounter, but for the animal&#8217;s well being, it is important to keep the encounter brief and maintain some distance.</p>
<p>A fawn's best chance of survival lies in being raised by its mother. Fawns nurse three to four times a day, usually for less than thirty minutes at a time, but otherwise the doe keeps her distance. This helps reduce the chances that she will attract a predator to the fawn. The fawn's protective coloration, near lack of scent and ability to remain motionless all help it avoid detection by predators and people.</p>
<p>If you find a fawn you should not approach it and by no means touch it or pick it up. The mother will most likely return to claim it. If you feel that the animal is in harms way, maintain a substantial distance while still being able to observe it and contact the&#160;<strong>campus police department 459-2231</strong>&#160;or&#160;<strong>county&#160;</strong><strong>Animal Control: <span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;">831-454-7227</span>.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to potentially harming a fawn, state and federal laws forbid possession of game and many non-game animals, so adopting newborn wildlife is usually illegal. If a fawn has been "rescued" when it shouldn't have been, it can often be released at the same location. Parents tend to remain in the area for at least a day, looking for the lost youngster.</p>

UC Santa Cruz and other UC campuses are among the institutions that have joined the action collaborative as members.</p>
<p>The purpose of the action collaborative is to bring together academic leaders and key stakeholders to prevent sexual harassment across all disciplines and among all people in higher education. It is designed to be an active space where colleges, universities, and research and training organizations can research and develop efforts that move beyond basic legal compliance to evidence-based policies and practices for addressing and preventing all forms of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, is representing UC Santa Cruz in the action collaborative.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is tremendous that the National Academies are organizing colleges and universities to confront the pernicious problem of sexual harassment in higher education,&#8221; Koch said. &#8220;Given our commitment to social justice and work to move beyond compliance in addressing this issue, I&#8217;m pleased and proud to represent UC Santa Cruz in this national effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>The action collaborative builds on the National Academies&#8217; 2018 report <em>Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine</em>, which found that between 20 percent and 50 percent of female students and more than 50 percent of female faculty and staff experienced sexually harassing behavior while in academia. The report provides a road map with a range of promising practices for preventing sexual harassment, such as using bystander intervention, producing annual reports to convey that reports of sexual harassment are taken seriously and people are held accountable, and combining anti-harassment efforts with programs to promote civility and respect.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s exciting to see academic institutions come together to address sexual harassment in a collective, structural approach to ending long-standing patterns of discrimination,&#8221; said Elizabeth Hillman, president of Mills College, a member of the action collaborative&#8217;s leadership group and a member of the study committee that wrote the 2018 report.</p>
<p>The four main goals of the action collaborative are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>raise awareness about sexual harassment and how it occurs, the consequences of sexual harassment, and the organizational characteristics and recommended approaches that can prevent it;</li>
<li>share and elevate evidence-based institutional policies and strategies to reduce and prevent sexual harassment;</li>
<li>contribute to setting the research agenda, and gather and apply research results across institutions; and</li>
<li>develop a standard for measuring progress toward reducing and preventing sexual harassment in higher education.</li>
</ul>
<p>The action collaborative will also deal with the issue of sexual harassment in the context of other damaging behavior, including incivility, bullying, and other forms of harassment such as racial harassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that going forward even more colleges, universities, and other organizations will join us in our efforts,&#8221; said Frazier Benya, a senior program officer at the National Academies who is directing the action collaborative.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will end on a poignant note,&#160;with members of the UC Santa Cruz community taking a moment to honor Chancellor George Blumenthal, <a href="https://#https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2019/03/a-chancellor-looks-back/">who&#160;is retiring and stepping down from his post</a> after what will have been 13 years as the top administrator at UC Santa Cruz. Blumenthal has worked at UC Santa Cruz since 1972, starting as a faculty member in astronomy and astrophysics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Riepe (Oakes &#8217;91, computer engineering), president of the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Council, is one of the speakers who will honor Blumenthal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I will certainly miss George after he retires,&#8221; Riepe said.&#160; &#8220;He has always been extremely generous with his time, attending many Alumni Council meetings, and making an effort to get to know each of us.&#160; He views alumni as true partners of the university.&#8221; He also praised Blumenthal as &#8220;an extremely accomplished listener.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recently refurbished Quarry Amphitheater is a fitting place to honor Blumenthal, considering that the campus&#8217;s first-ever comprehensive fundraising campaign, which raised $335 million, was one of his highest priorities; the renovation of the previously shuttered amphitheater was one of the fundraiser&#8217;s key initiatives, which also included the rebuilt Hay Barn near the main entrance, new academic programs and scholarships for students, research and teaching support for faculty, new cultural programs and archives, and deeper engagement with the campus&#8217;s alumni and surrounding community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attendants are strongly encouraged to <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=3420&amp;cid=6314">register for this event in advance.</a></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="08fcab438072701734bebd3c784456ca"><name>acting-dean-humanites</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Karen Bassi to serve as acting dean of Humanities</title><summary>Karen Bassi, literature professor, has agreed to serve as acting dean of the Humanities Division while Dean Tyler Stovall is on sabbatical. </summary><start-date>1554879600000</start-date><display-name>Karen Bassi to serve as acting dean of Humanities</display-name><path>/2019/04/acting-dean-humanites</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/acting-dean-humanites</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1554928936981</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1554928936981</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I'm pleased to announce that Karen Bassi, literature professor, has agreed to serve as acting dean of the Humanities Division while Dean Tyler Stovall is on sabbatical. Karen's appointment began March 1 and will run through June 30, 2019, when Tyler is set to return.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Karen has a long history with the campus. She earned her bachelor's in classics from UC Santa Cruz in 1980, later earning her Ph.D. from Brown University. She returned to UCSC as a faculty member in 1989. In her tenure here, she has served as chair of the literature department, director of the classics program, and director of the Educational Abroad Program in the Netherlands.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0 0;">I am deeply appreciative of her willingness to serve the division and the campus in this capacity.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, Marlene Tromp </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="091742d28072701734bebd3c733c135d"><name>suspicious-person</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Crime Bulletin: suspicious person near Humanities Building</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department received a report about a man who followed two female students near the Humanities Building around 2 a.m. this morning.

<p>Lam comes to the campus as part of The Humanities Institute&#8217;s <em>Scholars-in-Residence</em> program. He is the writer, editor, and producer of <em>Hi-Phi Nation, </em>billed as the first podcast weaving philosophy with narrative storytelling, investigative journalism, and sound design.</p>
<p>It is also the first philosophy show to be picked up by a major podcast network.</p>
<p>During his visit, Lam will speak with various groups on campus about such wide-ranging topics as public philosophy, podcasting, artificial intelligence, and criminal justice reform.</p>
<p>"THI&#8217;s <em>Scholars-in-Residence</em> program allows us to bring a fresh perspective onto issues that our faculty, students, and the broader community are grappling with," noted managing director Irena Poli&#263;. "We launched the program in 2017 and have since partnered with the Center for Jewish Studies and the Baskin Chair in Feminist Studies, and will be hosting a visiting scholar in 2020 in partnership with the Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning."</p>
<p>"This year, we are thrilled to be hosting Barry Lam, an extraordinarily creative and dynamic scholar, in partnership with the <a href="https://publicphilosophy.ucsc.edu"><strong><em>Center for Public Philosophy</em></strong></a>," Poli&#263; added. "Barry&#8217;s podcast, <em>Hi-Phi Nation,</em> is at the forefront of public philosophy and aligns perfectly with our mission to expand the field of humanities scholarship with digital tools and to engage with the broadest community possible."</p>
<p><strong>Lam kicks off his residency </strong>on April 11 with a free public presentation titled <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/fighting-future-philosophy-predictive-algorithms-criminal-justice/"><strong><em>Fighting the Future: The Philosophy of Predictive Algorithms in Criminal Justice</em></strong></a>&#8212;continuing the THI&#8217;s series of conversations this year about Data and Democracy.</p>
<p>Lam will discuss the different stages of the criminal justice system&#8212;such as policing, bail hearings, and sentencing&#8212;where computerized algorithms are replacing human decision-making in deciding where to police, who to arrest, who goes to jail, and who goes free.</p>
<p>His talk will introduce people to how these algorithms work, as well as &#8220;the under-appreciated moral problems with their implementation, and how the future of criminal justice depends on decisions we make now about the risks we are willing to tolerate for public safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>On April 13, Lam will also serve as a judge for the Center for Public Philosophy&#8217;s <a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/ethics-bowl/bringing-ethics-bowl/"><strong><em>Outreach Invitational High School Ethics Bowl</em></strong></a>. And during his UCSC residency, Lam will also be finishing up and releasing the next episode of <em>Hi-Phi Nation</em>. &#160;</p>

Yang was appointed admissions director in January. (Photo by Linsdey Vande Wege)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The child of Hmong immigrants from Laos, Blia Yang never imagined that college could be a part of her life.</p>
<p>But now, she is the director of undergraduate admissions at UC Santa Cruz. She may very well be the first Hmong admissions director in the state&#8212;or at least the UC system.</p>
<p>As admissions director, Yang helps lead the campus in recruiting, admitting, and enrolling the next generation of Banana Slugs.</p>
<p>Yang and her family left Laos in the aftermath of the Vietnam War for fear of their safety. After landing first in a refugee camp in Thailand, they were resettled in Oklahoma in 1980 when Yang was 4. That state wasn&#8217;t a good fit and after a couple of years, the family joined relatives in Fresno.</p>
<p>Her parents tried their hand at farming strawberries, zucchini, and tomatoes but weren&#8217;t able to compete with big agribusinesses or keep up with the rules and regulations. They also tried with other families to run a convenience store serving the Hmong community. Eventually, the family grew to nine children (Yang is the second to the oldest). They depended on government assistance in the form of cash aid or food stamps since neither parent spoke English or had transferable skills they could use in the U.S. Because of health problems, her father became disabled and the family lived on government assistance.</p>
<p>With her parents&#8217; encouragement, Yang worked hard at school and was put in the Gifted and Talented Education program. One day in a junior high, a teacher told her she should think about going to college.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s when the first inkling of higher education came into my consciousness,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Even then, being in junior high, I didn&#8217;t have the next steps. The knowledge was put in my brain and was sitting there.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she signed up for Advanced Placement courses and paid attention when her peers talked about college. She started learning about what it took to get in to a university. &#8220;I was pretty singularly focused,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>When she looked around her own community, she could see a pathway marked for women and a pathway marked for men. Women were expected to get married young and have children right away and live a life of service to family. Men were encouraged to build a career. While she wasn&#8217;t against any of those choices, she thought she should have the same options as men.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt I worked just as hard as the men,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wanted to go to college because it spelled opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>A teacher in high school organized a college tour for her and several students, helping them fund-raise and then renting a car to take them to the different campuses.</p>
<p>Yang decided she wanted to go to UC Santa Barbara&#8212;but that was going to come as a shock to her family. While her parents wanted her to go to college&#8212;they assumed she would attend somewhere local like Fresno City College or California State University, Fresno. They never thought she would enroll in a college four hours away.</p>
<p>Yang applied on her own, not involving her parents at all and waited until the last minute to tell them where she planned to attend. The news did not go over well. Her parents flat out forbade her to attend. But Yang wasn&#8217;t having it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so stubborn and committed, I said &#8216;I&#8217;m telling you I&#8217;m going and that&#8217;s that,&#8217;&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She moved into the dorms with a friend without any assistance from her family. Her departure was full of angry feelings but over time, things lightened up and her family came around.</p>
<p>When she finished her bachelor&#8217;s degree in Asian American studies, she quickly accepted a job at the university. &#8220;I called my mother and told her &#8216;I&#8217;m not coming home,&#8217;&#8221; she said. &#8220;I remember being sad about that&#8212;it was the next step and this was it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yang went on to get a master&#8217;s degree in guidance and counseling from California Lutheran University and in philosophy from UC Santa Barbara. She joined UC Santa Cruz as associate director of admissions in 2013. She is married and has two children, ages 4 and 2.</p>
<p>Her experiences have given her compassion for other students facing the same challenges in becoming first-generation college students.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have such compassion for families,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I know every family has its unique dynamics. I have compassion for that process and the family going through it and I have compassion for students who are pioneers.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="22247af78072701734bebd3c875e1fc7"><name>engineering-aw-advance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Weekend: A cornucopia of Slugs come home, seeking thrills and techno-inspiration</title><summary>The Baskin School of Engineering will be in the spotlight throughout UC Santa Cruz's Alumni Weekend, with demonstrations of virtual reality, cutting-edge research, small seminar-style "teach-ins" and more. </summary><start-date>1555351200000</start-date><display-name>alumniweekendengineeringadvance</display-name><path>/2019/04/engineering-aw-advance</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/engineering-aw-advance</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1555350976425</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1555441017869</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/awengineeringcave350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/awengineeringcave350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>awengineeringcave350.jpg</name><display-name>awengineeringcave350.jpg</display-name><file-size>38781</file-size><width>350</width><height>233</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/awengineeringthumbnail80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/awengineeringthumbnail80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>awengineeringthumbnail80.jpg</name><display-name>awengineeringthumbnail80.jpg</display-name><file-size>16904</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">A student stands inside of the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE).

This April 26&#8211;28 a cornucopia of Banana Slugs will return home for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Alumni Weekend 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the most anticipated events are those put on by the Baskin School of Engineering, a relatively new (in collegiate terms) wing of the university that has grown to encompass more than a quarter of the campus&#8217;s 16,952 undergraduates since its founding in 1997.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year engineering festivities begin at 6 p.m. on the school&#8217;s Silicon Valley Campus in Santa Clara (3175 Bowers Avenue): </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/silicon_valley_game_night#.XLEFXetKgWo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley Game Night </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">will feature a plethora of games created by students and faculty, which range from traditional entertainment games to serious games designed for health, education, industrial training, and activism. Enjoy a reception featuring demonstrations of virtual reality and other Slug creations, plus a panel discussion and a mixer.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/silicon_valley_game_night#.XLEFXetKgWo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Register here for Silicon Valley Game Night. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday is an opportunity to learn from faculty about the exciting research taking place at Baskin Engineering. There will be three simultaneous teach-ins, beginning at 11 a.m. (doors open at 10:30 a.m.). Unusual for teach-ins, these will be small, seminar-style classes with ample opportunity to engage with the professors directly.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/teach-ins"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More information and registration for teach-ins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=HXeiXGOtDZ0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here is a video of last year&#8217;s teach in.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Bernick, assistant adjunct professor of biomolecular engineering, will be discussing &#8220;Fuel, Food, and Pharma: Can Synthetic Biology Empower Social Change?&#8221; He works with biofuels produced with &#8220;reengineered extremophiles&#8221; and is an authority on next-generation sequencing applications, particularly virus discovery and single molecule sequencing of highly structured/modified tRNA and novel halo virus discovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His teach-in, like all the others, is designed to be enjoyed by all curious Banana Slugs&#8212;no matter their major or career path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lise Getoor, professor of computer science and engineering, will be discussing &#8220;Responsible Data Science.&#8221; Getoor is a preeminent authority on machine learning and data science. As credit decisions, sentencing outcomes, and other complex decision-making processes are increasingly decided by algorithms, Getoor is deeply concerned with educating the general public about the benefits and shortcomings of this new discipline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abhradeep Guha Thakurta, assistant professor of computer science and engineering, will be discussing &#8220;Decoding Genetic Privacy.&#8221; He describes his work as being at the intersection of machine learning and data privacy, particularly in designing privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms with strong analytical guarantees. He brings his experience in industry and academia to create unique insights into some of the most confounding problems facing people today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the teach-ins will be a special treat: at noon, enjoy an intimate lunch with Baskin School of Engineering Dean Alexander Wolf. Lunch will be served al fresco in the courtyard between the two engineering buildings. Wolf will highlight the school&#8217;s recent significant accomplishments, and discuss entrepreneurial thinking and experiential learning. It&#8217;s an opportunity to meet the current dean and hear about the future being created at UC Santa Cruz. (There will be an $8 fee to cover the cost of food.)</span></p>
<p><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/lunch_with_dean_wolf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More information and registration for lunch. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most exciting event of all comes after lunch. From 1:30&#8211;3 p.m., three engineering labs will offer tours and presentations of amazing work being done at Baskin School of Engineering. As with the teach-ins, these tours are designed for anyone to enjoy.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/lab_tours"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More information and registration for lab tours</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) is akin to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Holodeck. UC Santa Cruz is one of the few universities in the country with one installed. Sri Kurniawan, professor of computational media, and Mircea Teodorescu, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering, will discuss how they use this unique machine and its many applications in design, restorative health, literature, and more. </span><a href="https://youtu.be/iZBFz4BqiuY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch the video.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hybrid Systems Lab will also be opening its doors. A must-see for anyone interested in robotics or automation, hybrid systems describes some of the most complex and interesting (and spectacular) processes in nature and technology. Ricardo Sanfelice, professor of electrical and computer engineering, will be giving a presentation and discussing some of the ways his team uses the lab. </span><a href="https://youtu.be/-YUdRWV4LNY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch the video.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells is offering a chance to see the future of medicine in action. Camilla Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering, will be guiding visitors through the equipment they use and some of the fascinating work being done in the lab. Observe the way tissues are sampled, cultured, and examined; watch demonstrations; and meet the people working with the building blocks of life. </span></p>

Only a few piles will be burned each day. Smoke is not expected to be noticeable on main campus. All piles will be extinguished before Cal Fire leaves the area.&#160;<br/><br/>Pile burns are tightly controlled and typically produce less smoke than prescribed burns. However, persons susceptible to smoke are advised to avoid the north campus area.<br/><br/>Santa Cruz County has not experienced a major wildfire in recent years, but devastating fires throughout California this past fall remind us we all must do our part to prevent them. That includes controlling vegetation in and around campus. The pile burns are part of that effort.&#160;<br/><br/>For more wildland fire information including campus prevention efforts, please visit the UC Santa Cruz&#160;<a href="https://oes.ucsc.edu/emergency-management/preparedness/hazard-resources/wildland-fires.html#https://oes.ucsc.edu/emergency-management/preparedness/hazard-resources/wildland-fires.html">wildland fire resource page.&#160;</a></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="272472ee8072701734bebd3c69b60a08"><name>citris-funding</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz researchers win four CITRIS seed funding awards</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz researchers are principal investigators of four collaborative teams chosen for funding by the the signature seed funding program of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute. </summary><keywords>Yu Zhang, Michael Wehner</keywords><start-date>1555398000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz researchers win four CITRIS seed funding awards</display-name><path>/2019/04/citris-funding</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/citris-funding</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1555434860487</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1555435234833</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/citris-logo-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/citris-logo-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>citris-logo-400.jpg</name><display-name>citris-logo-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>31765</file-size><width>400</width><height>244</height></image><image-alt>CITRIS logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/citris-logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/citris-logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>citris-logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>citris-logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18725</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>CITRIS logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz researchers are principal investigators of four collaborative teams chosen for funding by the the signature seed funding program of the <a href="https://citris-uc.org/">Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society</a> (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute.</p>

Arribere, who studies quality control mechanisms used by cells to detect and remove mistakes in gene expression, is one of 15 young scientists to receive the prestigious awards this year.</p>
<p>The Searle Scholars Program makes grants to selected universities and research centers to support the independent research of exceptional young faculty in the biomedical sciences and chemistry. The program supports high-risk, high-reward research across a broad range of scientific disciplines.</p>
<p>Arribere studies how cells detect abnormal gene expression and protect themselves from its deleterious effects. Failure or inappropriate activation of these quality control mechanisms have been implicated in a wide range of genetic diseases, including some types of muscular dystrophies, Parkinson's disease, and hypothyroidism.</p>
<p>The Searle funding will support Arribere's research focusing on a pathway called "nonsense-mediated decay" (NMD), which identifies and removes errors that prematurely stop protein synthesis, resulting in truncated proteins. These errors occur when the messenger RNA carrying the genetic code for the protein includes a premature "stop codon."</p>
<p>Researchers have found that at least 11 percent of all human genetic diseases, and perhaps as many as 60 percent, are caused by a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon. In addition, it is thought that every person has in their cells about 120 genes that produce messenger RNAs containing premature stop codons that are silenced by nonsense-mediated decay.</p>
<p>"With those mutations, the messenger RNA produces an abnormally short protein, so the cell attacks the messenger RNA and gets rid of it. But there is no consensus on how this happens," Arribere said.</p>
<p>His lab recently discovered what appears to be a key step in this process in which a ribosome (the molecular machine that synthesizes proteins in all cells) gets stuck on a stop codon, and the messenger RNA gets attacked on the ribosome by the NMD pathway and cut at the stop codon. Based on these findings, Arribere has proposed a new model for nonsense-mediated decay, which his lab will evaluate in an effort to resolve long-standing questions.</p>
<p>"This pathway has been known for decades, and there are a lot of ideas about how it might work, but no agreement," he said. "A better understanding of these processes could help us to predict the effects of genetic mutations much more accurately."</p>
<p>Arribere earned his B.A. in applied mathematics and molecular and cellular biology at UC Berkeley and his Ph.D. in biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After a postdoctoral position at Stanford University School of Medicine, he joined the UCSC faculty in 2017.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for <em>The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke</em>, his definitive biography of the father of the Harlem Renaissance.</p>
<p>Meticulously researched, the book explores Locke's professional and private life--from his early education, which included becoming the first African American Rhodes Scholar, to his promotion of black culture and the literary and artistic work of African Americans, shifting the discussion of race from politics and economics to the arts.</p>
<p>The Pulitzer award follows Stewart winning the National Book Award for Nonfiction in 2018.</p>
<p>Now a professor of Black Studies at UC Santa Barbara and chair of the Black Studies Department, Stewart has spent his career studying the issues of race and culture as they relate to art, history, literature, music, and philosophy.</p>
<p>His previous books include <em>1001 Things Everyone Should Know About African American History</em> and <em>Paul Robeson: Artist and Citizen</em>.</p>
<p>After graduating from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in philosophy, Stewart received his Ph.D. from Yale University in American Studies. He became director of research at the Smithsonian Institution&#8217;s Anacostia Museum, a curator at the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Portrait Gallery, and a senior advisor to the Reginald Lewis Museum of African American History and Culture in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
<p>He was also a Fulbright Professor of American Studies at the University of Rome III, a W.E.B. Du Bois and a Charles Warren Fellow at Harvard University, and lecturer at the Terra Foundation for American art in Giverny, France.</p>
<p>The author of numerous articles, essays and books, Stewart has additionally taught at Harvard University, Yale, UCLA, Tufts University, Howard University, Scripps College, and George Mason University.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz now has seven winners of nine Pulitzer Prizes.</p>
<p>Past alumni recipients include <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer <strong>William Finnegan</strong> (who also won in the biography category for 2016); <strong>Martha Mendoza</strong> of the <em>Associated Press</em>; <strong>Dana Priest</strong> with the <em>Washington Post</em>; <strong>Laurie Garrett</strong> with <em>Newsday</em>; and <strong>Hector Tobar</strong> and <strong>Annie Wells,</strong> who worked at the <em>Los Angeles Times.</em></p>
<p>Both Mendoza and Priest have the distinction of receiving two Pulitzers; they have each been honored for both investigative reporting and public service.</p>

But geographers are keeping an eye on this gateway nation, where newly identified Afro-Italian youth are leading a movement to reform Italy's citizenship laws and women entrepreneurs are emerging as a force.</p>
<p>Camilla Hawthorne, assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, says economic stagnation and a resurgence of racist nationalism are shaping conversations about what it means to be Italian in the 21st century.</p>
<p>"Italy's economy is struggling, unemployment is high, the far-right won the recent election, and xenophobia is on the rise. These are trends we're seeing across Europe and elsewhere," said Hawthorne.</p>
<p>At the same time, Italy is now home to nearly 1 million Italian-born children of immigrants who, by law, lack citizenship. How the country responds to their demands for recognition and rights, and the emergence of Afro-Italian women entrepreneurs who are transforming notions of beauty and what it means to be Italian, will shape the future of the country, said Hawthorne.</p>
<p>"These people are the future of Europe. They make up 10 percent of Italy's youth population," said Hawthorne, author of an <a href="https://www.academia.edu/38662410/Making_Italy_Afro-Italian_entrepreneurs_and_the_racial_boundaries_of_citizenship">article</a> in the current online issue of <em>Social &amp; Cultural Geography</em>. "Birthrates of white Europeans are declining across Europe. Tensions are coming to a head in Italy because it is the first point of arrival for many immigrants, and black Italians are the most prominent group challenging the persistent conflation of whiteness with being Italian."</p>
<p>Italian citizenship law, known as <em>jus sanguinis</em>, or "right of blood," stipulates that Italian-born children of immigrants have no automatic right to Italian citizenship. Instead, at the age of 18, they have one year to prove they have lived in Italy continuously from birth. Otherwise, those who are not employed or enrolled in higher education are at risk of being deported to their parents' home country.</p>
<p>It's only in the last five or so years that black youth have begun calling themselves "Afro-Italian," according to Hawthorne. "They are beginning to collectively identify as 'Afro' or 'Black' and to mobilize politically from these identities," she said. "We are in the midst of the largest mass movement of people across borders in recent history.&#160;We can learn from what's happening in Italy."</p>
<p><em>Entrepreneurs redefine what it means to be Italian</em></p>
<p>Hawthorne's article, "<a href="https://www.academia.edu/38662410/Making_Italy_Afro-Italian_entrepreneurs_and_the_racial_boundaries_of_citizenship">Making Italy: Afro-Italian Entrepreneurs and the Racial Boundaries of Citizenship</a>," highlights the emergence of Afro-Italian women entrepreneurs and their impact on dominant narratives about immigrants and "Italian-ness." These women specialize in black fashion, style, and hair-care products, and they are leveraging the internet to market their products, build community, challenge norms of Italian beauty, and expand the scope of the "Made in Italy" brand to include products made specifically for Afro-Italians.</p>
<ul>
<li>Italian-Ghanaian Evelyne Afaawua founded a Facebook page in Italian about the care of natural black hair, originally called "Afro Italian Nappy Girls." Based in Milan, <em>Nappytalia</em> is now a multi-platform social media presence, and Afaawua recently launched a line of organic natural hair products for black women; <em>Nappytalia</em> joins AfroRicci, another Afro-Italian enterprise and the first company to launch "Made in Italy" products for Afro-textured hair.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The AFRO Fashion Association, founded in 2015 by Italian-Cameroonian journalist Michelle Ngonmo and Italian-Ghanaian fashion designer Ruth Maccarthy, launched the first Afro Fashion Week in the world's fashion capital of Milan in 2017. The event featured designers from Africa, as well as fashion inspired by African textiles, with an explicit goal of promoting a new culture the organizers called "Afro."</li>
</ul>
<p>This new sense of "Italian-ness" unites the traditional Italian aesthetic with cultural influences drawn from subSaharan and Latin American black cultures; it is evident in the use of West African wax print fabrics in clothing, and the incorporation of cocoa and shea butters in Italian cosmetics.</p>
<p>"This marriage of African fabrics, colors, and patterns with Italian style stands in contrast to media depictions of an 'African invasion,' " said Hawthorne. "It counters resurgent racist narratives that immigrants are lazy or taking away jobs."</p>
<p>These women entrepreneurs are receiving widespread media coverage and building community and mobilizing for the rights and dignity of black women in Italy&#8212;a message that's being as well-received as their products. Their success has the potential to awaken Italy's moribund economy and even to revitalize a stagnant nation.</p>
<p>"As Italy has embraced insularity and far-right, anti-globalist politics, it has lost some of its cosmopolitan flair," observed Hawthorne. "Rather than always being cast as Europe's outsiders, these new generations could be a cultural bridge that re-connects Italy to the rest of the world."&#160;</p>
<p><em>Inclusion/Exclusion: What does solidarity look like?</em></p>
<p>The emergence of Afro-Italian youth activism and women's entrepreneurship represent a new chapter&#8212;but fissures could emerge.</p>
<p>Hawthorne cautions that Italy's entrepreneurial and activist "citizens-in-waiting" could be forced to pit themselves against newly arrived black refugees, who get labeled by the media and politicians as "unproductive."</p>
<p>"Citizenship can be a path to racial inclusion for Italian-born children of black immigrants, but at the same time, the reform of these laws could also become a tool of oppression against black refugees," noted Hawthorne. "Potential allegiances among black citizens-in-waiting and black refugees can't be taken for granted." Some activist youth worry about alienating themselves from their own immigrant parents as they pursue citizenship by portraying themselves as "authentically Italian."</p>
<p>Italy's embrace of far-right ethno-nationalism and the stunning failure of citizenship reform legislation in 2017 seems to have prompted Afro-Italian activists to engage more broadly, said Hawthorne.</p>
<p>"They are thinking beyond Italy," she said. "They&#8217;re connecting with first-generation black immigrants and refugees, and linking their struggles to mobilizations in other places, like the Dreamers and the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. They are thinking about the legacies of Italian colonialism in Africa."</p>
<p>"Looking at the children who are being born in Italy today, the big question is who counts as Italian? Who counts as European?" said Hawthorne. "Afro-Italian youth political activism is shifting to focus on anti-racism through broader black diasporic alliances. They are finding the answer in solidarity."</p>

<p>Batalha was among more than 200 new members of the academy announced this week, including former first lady Michelle Obama, author Jonathan Franzen, and NPR science correspondent (and UCSC alumnus) Joe Palca. Batalha joins 23 other UCSC faculty who are fellows of the academy.</p>
<p>Founded in 1780, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences honors exceptional scholars, leaders, artists, and innovators and engages them in sharing knowledge and addressing challenges facing the world.</p>
<p>Batalha is an eminent planetary astronomer who served in multiple science leadership roles for NASA&#8217;s highly successful Kepler Mission, which discovered over 2,700 exoplanets and another 2,000 candidates awaiting confirmation. She earned her Ph.D. in astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz in 1997 and received the campus's Alumni Achievement Award in 2018.</p>
<p>The Kepler Mission launched in 2009 to determine the frequency of Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of sun-like stars. Batalha got involved early on, when it was still in the proposal stage, and she contributed to many different aspects of the science, from studying the stars themselves to detecting and understanding the planets they harbor. In 2017, she was named to <em>Time</em> magazine&#8217;s list of the &#8220;100 most influential people in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Batalha joined the astronomy faculty at UC Santa Cruz in fall 2018. Her research focuses on exploring the diversity of planets in our galaxy. She is also bringing multiple disciplines of study together to explore the broader question of planetary habitability.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the election of these members, the Academy upholds the ideals of research and scholarship, creativity and imagination, intellectual exchange and civil discourse, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge in all its forms,&#8221; said academy president David Oxtoby.</p>
<p>Academy members include those who discover and advance knowledge and those who apply knowledge to the problems of society. Elected members join with other experts in cross-disciplinary efforts to produce reflective, independent, and pragmatic studies that inform public policy and advance the public good.</p>
<p>The new class will be inducted at a ceremony in October 2019 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The greatest impact is expected from 3&#8211;6 p.m.</p>
<p>Similar to 2018, we will have an increased law enforcement presence with additional UC police officers, as well as allied law enforcement agencies throughout the campus conducting enforcement activities. These officers will conduct enhanced patrols throughout the day, looking for individuals in violation of the law, including the possession of and/or using marijuana and alcohol or other drugs; drivers under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol; and will enforce distracting driving laws, unpermitted vending of any merchandise, food, water, services, or marijuana of any kind on the campus. Campus parking regulations will also be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>In addition to these enforcement efforts, the <strong>Santa Cruz Area CHP will be conducting a DUI checkpoint near the west side of campus</strong>, aggressively seeking those who choose to drive under the influence. In 2018, we arrested two DUI drivers, including one driver in possession of a firearm. We also wrote numerous citations for marijuana violations and traffic related violations.</p>
<p>There will not be any Campus Loop Shuttles and Metro bus service will be on limited weekend service. Traffic diversion measures may be instituted if needed to alleviate impacted areas. If driving a vehicle, be alert for increased pedestrian traffic on all roadways, as well as the signage indicating the presence of the DUI checkpoint.</p>
<p>There are potentially serious consequences of choosing to attend. We ask that individuals consider the risks and possible criminal penalties. Individuals affiliated with the campus are also subject to sanctions by the Student Conduct Office or Human Resources.</p>
<p>As we continue to talk about the impacts of drugs and alcohol on this campus, and to the greater Santa Cruz community, it is also important to know the facts around the recreational use of marijuana at UC Santa Cruz. You should know that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possession and/or use of marijuana in any form (edibles, plant, concentrated, vaporized, etc.) on the campus, or any university property is not legal.</li>
<li>It is not legal for any person to smoke or ingest marijuana in a public place, both on and off campus. A citation could cost you up to $500 per violation when court fees are attached.</li>
<li>It is not legal to drive a vehicle or ride a bicycle impaired or under the influence of marijuana.</li>
<li>It is not legal to possess marijuana for sale, transport, import, furnish, or give away marijuana.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are committed to the health and safety of our community. We know that this can be a challenging day for our students who are substance free or who are trying to stay away from those using marijuana. The Cove is open all day on 4&#8211;20 to support students wanting a sober space, with a BBQ and music starting at 12:30 More information can be <a href="https://shop.ucsc.edu/students-in-recovery/thecove.html">found online</a> or by contacting Jorge Bru at <a href="mailto:jbru@ucsc.edu">jbru@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>

<p>The five recipients of the 2019 Distinguished Graduate Student Alumni Award exemplify the diverse ways in which the former graduate students have translated their scholarship into an appreciable impact in various fields.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz graduate student alumni are providing insights into the future of renewable energy, advancing the territory of linguistic theory, producing incisive and important journalism, crafting significant and provocative artistic productions, developing technology to cure cancer, and much more.</p>
<p>The five recipients are set to be honored as part of Alumni Weekend, April 26&#8211;28. Awards will be conferred during a luncheon at 11:30 a.m. Saturday, April 27, at the Stevenson Event Center to be followed immediately by the Career Paths Panel, where honorees are slated to discuss how their studies at UC Santa Cruz informed their flourishing careers.</p>
<p>The five graduate alumni honorees and the graduate divisions they represent include the following:</p>
<h3><img alt="Steve Benz" height="250" src="images/steve-benz-200px.jpg" style="float: right; margin-right: 4px; margin-left: 4px;" width="200"/>Steve Benz, president, Genomics division of NantOmics</h3>
<p>Most of the awardees recognized this year took the knowledge and skills accrued during their graduate studies and translated them into successful careers. For Steve Benz, it was a bit different as he began his career while still enrolled at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Benz graduated with a M.S. in biomolecular engineering and bioinformatics in 2010 before earning a Ph.D. in the same discipline in 2012. It was during those years he and two of his fellow students in the program (Zack Sanborn, Ph.D. 2012, and Charlie Vaske, Ph.D. 2009) developed the ideas and technology that became the foundation of Five3 Genomics&#8212;a company on the bleeding edge of cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were talking with our advisor about our projects and he said, &#8216;Hey look, what you have here is pretty good,&#8217;&#8221; Benz said. &#8220;Our ideas were so unique at the time our advisor thought they were worthy of getting patents.&#8221;</p>
<p>The technology in question involved extracting normal and cancer cells from a cancer patient and comparing the results to determine what was driving the patient&#8217;s tumor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the first ever tumor versus normal sequence comparison,&#8221; Benz said. Along with that technology, Benz and his partners developed a pathway algorithm capable of mapping the interaction of genes within tumors. They created a company and sought funding to help bring their technology to market.</p>
<p>While still being refined, the product is already helping oncologists personalize treatments for cancer patients by identifying which specific genes are affected by a given cancer thereby determining which drugs are best aligned to help attack the disease.</p>
<p>Three years after graduating, Benz and the team sold Five3 Genomics to NantOmics where he continues to serve as president of the genomics division.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of this would have happened without the guidance and advice of Professor David Haussler and the rest of the team at UCSC,&#8221; Benz said. &#8220;They&#8217;re the ones who gave us the right direction, kicked us out of the nest and said, &#8216;You have the technology that can change the world, so go change the world.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<h3><img alt="Elaine Gan" height="250" src="images/elaine-gan-200px.jpg" style="float: right; margin-right: 4px; margin-left: 4px;" width="200"/>Elaine Gan, artist and professor at New York University</h3>
<p>Elaine Gan&#8217;s artistic projects have been shown in prominent international venues the world over, while her scholarly work has appeared in a bevy of notable journals as she continues to teach at New York University.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fortunate that I don&#8217;t have to choose whether I am an artist or a scholar,&#8221; Gan said. &#8220;My research and writing would not be where they are without my artistic practice and at the same my art practice draws directly from my scholarship. They are really entangled at this point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gan credits her ability to balance seemingly distinct aspects of her professional life with the interdisciplinary approach fostered by her studies in the graduate arts division at UC Santa Cruz, where she earned a M.F.A. in digital arts and new media in 2011 and a Ph.D. in film and digital media with emphasis in Anthropology in 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;My studies were intense, particularly because they were so interdisciplinary,&#8221; Gan says. &#8220;I studied alongside artists, filmmakers, theorists, anthropologists, historians, physicists, plant ecologists, marine biologists, and researchers from many disciplines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gan was attracted to UC Santa Cruz because the graduate program facilitated interaction and cross-pollination between many forms and practices of human knowledge.</p>
<p>For her Ph.D., Gan focused on articulating the temporalities and coordinations involved in rice ecologies and industrialized agriculture&#8212;or how humans, nonhumans, and machines have co-evolved around rice grains over the last 12,000 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am really interested in expressing the kinds of arrangements and agencies that arise when different species start living together in different times and different landscapes,&#8221; Gan said. &#8220;My work with various kinds of rice has brought me to the Mekong river, a wildlife reserve in northern California, genetic labs and rice terraces in the Philippines, a seed vault in Norway, an experimental breeding station in Puerto Rico.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gan has since shown work both related and unrelated to her work at UCSC at various exhibitions around the world. She is co-editor of an anthology titled Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet: Ghosts and Monsters of the Anthropocene (Minnesota 2017) with mentors at UCSC. She is busy training the next generation of students at NYU and is also preparing her manuscript for publication in the next year or so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing together people and ideas from different departments at UCSC proved vital to my work,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll always be grateful to some truly magical people here.&#8221;</p>
<h3><img alt="Les Guliasi" height="262" src="images/les-guliasi-200px.jpg" style="float: right; margin-right: 4px; margin-left: 4px;" width="200"/>Les Guliasi, President of the Power Association of Northern California</h3>
<p>Les Guliasi enjoyed an insider view as a vast network of politicians, corporate executives, technicians, and engaged citizens worked to shape California&#8217;s energy policy over the past quarter century.</p>
<p>Guliasi parlayed his activism and knowledge of the industry into a dissertation about the history of energy policy in California, earning a Ph.D. in sociology from UC Santa Cruz in 2018.</p>
<p>Guliasi was no stranger to UCSC, having earned an M.A. in sociology in 1977.</p>
<p>&#8220;What stuck with me most was the sense of community at UCSC,&#8221; Guliasi said. &#8220;The sense of community and the small size and philosophy of campus all the way from its original conception had a lot to do with fostering a sense of community and commitment. The relationship between faculty and students is certainly different than most places.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guliasi&#8217;s graduate work, which is currently under consideration for publication by the University of California Press, posits that the seeds of California&#8217;s current renewable energy stance&#8212;including efforts to render its electricity grid carbon free by 2045&#8212;were planted in the aftermath of the California Energy Crisis of 2000&#8211;2001.</p>
<p>Guliasi said his approach to this complex issue was guided by tools he developed while studying at UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the faculty came from a variety of different backgrounds, it presented an opportunity to weave together different disciplines,&#8221; Guliasi said. &#8220;A lot of other universities focus on specialization within the field of sociology, but at UCSC, we were encouraged to study international development, sociology, psychology and political economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guliasi said this cross-disciplinary approach was not only critical to his recent work, but helped forge success in his career, including stints in the private sector at large energy companies, consulting and in academia.</p>
<p>&#8220;My time at UCSC gave me the basic skill set and analytical framework to apply my skills in a variety of settings,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h3><img alt="Laura Helmuth" height="200" src="images/laura-helmuth-200.jpg" style="float: right; margin-right: 4px; margin-left: 4px;" width="200"/>Laura Helmuth, editor at The Washington Post</h3>
<p>Laura Helmuth graduated from the UC Santa Cruz Science Communication Program in 1998 and has since gone on to become a prolific editor, working at Slate, Science, Smithsonian and National Geographic magazines.</p>
<p>She currently serves as the Health, Science &amp; Environment Editor at The Washington Post.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being an editor is very satisfying and very challenging,&#8221; Helmuth said. &#8220;Journalists as a general rule tend to have their own ideas about things and while they are creative it can be a challenge to keep them focused.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Helmuth has done just that helping to churn out award-winning and highly respected articles covering the full gamut of issues relating to scientific matters.</p>
<p>Helmuth gives huge credit to her time at the UCSC science writing program.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a fantastic program and it still is,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It has trained a huge number of the most prominent science writers in this country and around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of what makes the program so successful is its no-frills concentration on the craft of journalism, Helmuth said. The program trains students with an academic background in science how to simplify scientific concepts and jargon, communicating ideas with concision and clarity.</p>
<p>But such practical guidance wasn&#8217;t the only benefit.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other valuable thing about the program is the social support and social network,&#8221; Helmuth said. &#8220;A lot of journalists who had been through the program would come back to mentor, edit our stories and tell us about career opportunities. It is a generous community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helmuth said reporting on scientific developments coming out of UC Santa Cruz helped train her for her career while the program&#8217;s focus on securing internships for students was pragmatic and important.</p>
<p>&#8220;The setting was great,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was like going to school in a state park.&#8221;</p>
<h3><img alt="Jason Merchant" height="251" src="images/jason-merchant-250px.jpg" style="float: right; margin-right: 4px; margin-left: 4px;" width="200"/>Jason Merchant, Vice Provost and Lorna Puttkammer Straus Professor in Linguistics</h3>
<p>Jason Merchant is not only one of the foremost researchers in the field of formal syntax, but he also serves as vice provost at the University of Chicago, where he oversees academic appointments along with establishing and implementing policies for Ph.D. students and postdocs.</p>
<p>Merchant earned a Ph.D. in linguistics from UC Santa Cruz in 1999 and has spent his career studying the concept of ellipsis, which is when words are omitted from speech or writing and meaning depends instead on contextual clues.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the job of the theorist to understand under what condition ellipsis occurs and what kinds of meanings arise,&#8221; Merchant said. The linguistics professor has also worked with a legal historian to understand if the phrase &#8220;right to keep and bear arms&#8221; in the Second Amendment referred to an individual right or the right of collective bodies like militias.</p>
<p>The source of such rich scholarship can be traced back to the graduate linguistics program at Santa Cruz, Merchant said.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz was and is one of the top linguistics programs in the country,&#8221; Merchant said. &#8220;Everyone in the field knows about Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t simply the rigorous scholarship that Merchant encountered while pursuing his advanced degree in the late 90s but the camaraderie and the setting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I first arrived on campus in 1993 and it was my first time visiting California,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was very eager to arrive after having lived on the East Coast and I was grateful to attend a great linguistics program but also to spend five years in paradise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Merchant fondly recalls working in a room with his fellow students laboring next to a window that overlooked the Pacific Ocean. The professor said the acumen of his professors was only matched by the striving of his fellow students, all of which combined to furnish an ideal environment for academic pursuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was as stimulating a program as I could imagine,&#8221; he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Arts and New Media M.F.A. program</strong></em></a>&#160;(DANM) will conclude two years of artistic study at UC Santa Cruz with&#160;<em>Receivership</em>&#8212;an exhibition of their work running on campus April 26 to May 12--at the UCSC Digital Arts Research Center, Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery, and Porter Faculty Gallery.</p>
<p>Bringing together the arts, digital technologies, the humanities, and the sciences, the DANM program is designed to produce artworks and scholarly research that examine culture, society, and the digital world.&#160;</p>
<p>"It's incredibly exciting to be expanding this year's DANM MFA showcase to the Sesnon Gallery, and to be extending the run-of-show as well," noted Robin Hunicke, acting director of the DANM Program. "DANM's graduating students continue to push the boundaries of what digital art means in the context of today's political, economic and global climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Works in this year's show look at the role of social media in our lives, the ways our bodies process sound and light, and the ways in which technology approaches, labels and represents us to each other. Through their work, the students are interrogating what it means to &#8216;entertain&#8217; to &#8216;play&#8217; and &#8216;interact&#8217; with screens, people and the planet."</p>
<p>"The truth is that we live in trying times,&#8221; Hunicke added. &#8220;In many ways, this show works to address the physical, emotional and financial turbulence we experience when systems break down, leadership fails, and the way ahead is uncertain. Having the opportunity to share this work with the public via this expanded and enhanced format is a testament to UCSC's commitment to creating art that helps us confront difficult and meaningful questions.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The exhibition is curated</strong> by John Weber, director of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences at UC Santa Cruz. He noted that the artists in this year&#8217;s exhibition embrace video, virtual reality, the internet, computer programming, photography, sound, music, and related analog processes as baseline tools for creating art.</p>
<p>&#8220;The artists in this cohort began their graduate studies in the autumn of 2016,&#8221; said Weber. &#8220;Since that time, fundamental assumptions and structures governing human institutions have been shaken at the international, national, and local levels, calling forth an aesthetics of engagement and resistance. That spirit is visible in a number of the works in this exhibition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time, other pieces subtly explore processes of perception and aesthetic reception,&#8221; Weber added. &#8220;They create immersive, deeply interactive experiences of sound, language, color, and the human experience. But technology, if omnipresent, is never an end in itself. It is a tool, a domain, and a condition to be harnessed in the service of something greater. This work testifies to the power of art experience, and to its capacity to impact human lives and the social world.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A series of opening events</strong> for the exhibition will take place on Saturday, April 27. Artist talks are scheduled from 2 to 4 p.m. at DARC 308, and the student artists will also be available to talk about their work in the galleries from 4 to 5 p.m. This will be followed by an opening reception outdoors by the Porter College Koi Pond at 5 p.m. All events are free and open to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DANM MFA thesis exhibition is a perennial favorite of arts faculty, students and alumni,&#8221; observed interim dean of the arts Edward (Ted) Warburton. &#8220;This cohort is an especially adventurous, experienced, and talented group, and I&#8217;m very excited to see what they&#8217;ve produced. I also want to recognize John Weber of the Institute&#160;of the Arts and Sciences for his outstanding curatorial expertise and Shelby Graham of the Sesnon Gallery for her active guidance in supporting the students&#8217; work.&#8221;&#160;</p>

<p>The Kavli Summer Program in Astrophysics combines the concept of a long-term workshop with graduate student training through research projects. Up to 15 established faculty, 15 post-doctoral researchers, and 15 graduate students come from around the world to join local scientists at the host institution for the six-week program, which alternates between UC Santa Cruz and various institutions world-wide.</p>
<p>The program begins with a one-week workshop on the topic of the year, after which the students are teamed with the senior participants and are expected to make significant progress on their selected project. Each year, the program tackles a different topic in astrophysics.</p>
<p>This year's topic addresses the challenges of big data in astronomy. Large astronomical surveys now collect unprecedented amounts of data, while large-scale computer simulations of astrophysical phenomena can also generate enormous datasets. To cope with this torrent of data, astronomers are adopting tools developed in the data science industry, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>"This field is very rapidly emerging in astronomy," said J. Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. "Indeed, some of the students attending have more experience than the organizers."</p>
<p>Prochaska is a co-director of the 2019 program, along with UCSC astronomers Alexie Leauthaud and Brant Robertson. Prochaska is also a co-founder of the Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute at UC Santa Cruz, one of the sponsors of the summer program. Pascale Garaud, professor of applied mathematics at UC Santa Cruz, started the program in 2010 as the International Summer Institute for Modeling in Astrophysics (ISIMA). The Kavli Foundation has been supporting the program since 2016.</p>
<p><span>"The Kavli Foundation is pleased to support innovative projects, and this year&#8217;s focus on big data addresses an issue of growing importance to astronomy," said Christopher Martin, senior science program officer for the Kavli Foundation.&#160;</span></p>
<p>In Santa Cruz, the Kavli Summer Program in Astrophysics is associated with TASC (Theoretical Astrophysics at Santa Cruz), a multi-departmental research group of UCSC scientists from Applied Mathematics, Astronomy and Astrophysics, Earth and Planetary Sciences, and Physics. Additional support for the 2019 program is provided by the National Science Foundation, UC Santa Cruz, and the UCSC Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="368a48de8072701734bebd3cbf2c7e71"><name>weigh-in-on-sap</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A final opportunity to weigh in on SAP</title><summary>We seek insight on prioritization from our entire campus community, and I invite you to participate.

Campus leadership, our Academic Senate, and many faculty, staff and students have invested a tremendous amount of time and energy in the SAP process, for which I am deeply grateful.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Your energy has driven this process and produced extraordinary results. I recently met with a national fundraising consultant who noted that he had seen hundreds of strategic academic plans. He said ours was the most exciting and unique plan he'd ever seen. That is UCSC. That is your work. I'm delighted to now be able to share this document with you and to invite your assistance and participation in a survey to prioritize the array of potential initiatives outlined in the document.</p>
<h2 id="history" style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>History</strong></h2>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">In the 2017-18 academic year, we connected with thousands of campus stakeholders, reached consensus on <a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/design-principles/" style="color: #00458c; margin-top: 0; text-decoration: underline;">Design Principles</a>, activated vital interdisciplinary and cross-campus collaborations, and planned working groups to study <a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/barrier-reduction/" style="color: #00458c; margin-bottom: 0; text-decoration: underline;">ways to reduce Barriers</a> that stand in the way of research, teaching, and learning on our campus.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">In July through September of the 2018-19 academic year, we invited community feedback on a first draft of the SAP. We incorporated that feedback into a second draft. We also articulated <a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/apa/" style="color: #00458c; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; text-decoration: underline;">Academic Priority Areas</a> and identified faculty leaders to network across campus and highlight cross-campus faculty hiring opportunities for the deans to consider. Several barrier-reduction working groups launched. From December through early March, we welcomed the community's insights on the second draft. Now through May 10, I'm excited to share the final draft.</p>
<h2 id="final-draft-sap" style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Final Draft SAP</strong></h2>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">The ideas offered by our faculty, students, staff, alumni, and leadership led to the impressive set of possible design principle initiatives in <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19uMNU2WhF_reFSc3_R8vxopl63e8udwM" style="color: #00458c; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; text-decoration: underline;">the SAP document</a>. It contains concrete goals, initiatives designed to foster and accomplish these goals, accountable leadership, and metrics designed to help us assess whether we are meeting our goals. Please review the plan. Our next step involves prioritizing the initiatives, and identifying those that our community believes are most beneficial to achieve each design principle.</p>
<h2 id="survey-to-prioritize-initiatives" style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Survey to Prioritize Initiatives</strong></h2>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I seek insight on prioritization from our entire campus community, and I invite you to participate. Please share your feedback on our <a href="https://relay.ucsc.edu/r/9e55b" style="color: #00458c; margin-top: 0; text-decoration: underline;">campuswide survey</a> by midnight May 10. Reflecting on your input and considering insight offered by the Senate and campus leadership, I will designate those initiatives that will be targeted as part of the SAP. Campus leaders will then develop action plans and timelines that will be shared with the community. Initiatives not identified for this project may <em style="margin-bottom: 0;">still</em> be pursued by individual campus leaders.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Thank you for your commitment to our campus and its mission; to our students, faculty, staff; and to our broader community of alumni, allies, and supporters.</p>

<p>Or at least I was when I sat down a couple of weeks ago to &#8220;enroll&#8221; in the new campus-wide effort at greater electronic security called <a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/mfa/enroll.html">multifactor authentication</a> (or MFA). I count myself among the cantankerous majority who shudder when the campus rolls out a new technological enhancement with which all of us will be required to comply. I&#8217;m not very good at seamlessly integrating new systems and platforms. I balk when I hear that some further barrier to the already not so smooth workings of my electronic life will be erected. I especially freak out when something is introduced that will potentially affect the already, for me, fragile functioning of classroom technologies such as Canvas quizzes and access to Google Slides. Basically, my entire response to upgrades like this can be summarized with a life-sized emoji of Edvard Munch&#8217;s <em>The Scream</em>.</p>
<p>A little background: as you have probably heard (even if, like me, you metaphorically put your hands over your ears or just hit delete when this kind of notice arrives in your inbox), over the next six months, by October, 2019, UCSC is transitioning to mandatory MFA for most campus online systems that require a Gold password. Right now, at least for faculty and students, this includes platforms like myUCSC and Canvas. Sometime in the summer, when Google also transitions to MFA, you can add your Drive, Docs, Calendar, Mail, Slides, Sheets, Chat, and Meet to the list.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much our entire selection of online instruction-related tools. And so, you might very well ask, WHY?</p>
<p>Also known as &#8220;two step authentication,&#8221; MFA is familiar to many of us from situations such as when we log into a bank account or other financial website using an unrecognized computer. The website sends a code to our cell phone that we must enter before proceeding with the transaction. MFA provides added security to prevent someone from using a stolen or hacked password to impersonate you.</p>
<p>Faculty are required to adopt MFA by May 20 and staff by July 29. Students will need to enroll between Sept. 3 and Oct. 21.</p>
<p>In university settings, MFA helps to keep student data, like grades, completed assignments, and contact information more secure. It also helps students protect their financial aid from theft. For faculty, it helps us keep our gradebooks, quizzes, exams, and instructional records--as well as a significant portion of our research output and personal information--safe from hackers and others who might want to access our data. The goal of MFA is to create a multilayered approach to personal identification that makes it difficult for any unauthorized person to gain access to our systems. This reduces the risk of fraudulent access to user information or UCSC resources, as well as materials related to classroom instruction and student academic records. Students using tiny devices to hack into faculty accounts and change grades: sound like fantasy? <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/11/01/new-type-hacking-puts-professors-accounts-risk">It isn&#8217;t</a>. If that sounds too high tech, at least none of us is trusting enough to save our passwords on a browser, right? <a href="https://www.quora.com/Hackers-Is-it-possible-to-hack-into-a-school-system-and-change-your-grades">Right</a>.</p>
<p>As far as classroom usage goes, faculty should be aware that students will need to use their MFA enrolled device (smartphone, tablet, or token) if they are going to connect to campus electronic systems like Canvas in the classroom. Enrolled devices will need to be handy if students are to connect to Canvas and other systems requiring a Gold password. Students (and faculty) who have not yet enrolled in MFA may be delayed in accessing campus information systems until they have completed the <a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/mfa/enroll.html">enrollment process</a>. In addition, faculty who do not routinely allow the use of cellphones in class may need to allow phones to be out at the start of a quiz so that students can authenticate. Instructors should be aware of and assess the impact this may have on classroom instruction, groupwork exercises, or administration of exams.</p>
<p>Additional information on MFA in the classroom can be <a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/mfa/classroom.html">found online</a>.</p>
<p>One piece of good news is that the campus has modified the original MFA plan in response to faculty and staff concerns. The <a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/mfa/remember-me.html">&#8216;Remember Me&#8217;</a> feature is now available and allows you to only have to MFA once every 14 days on your computer. Instructors who want to conduct Canvas quizzes or other online assessments in class should remind students to &#8220;authenticate&#8221; prior to the in-class exam.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest: I didn&#8217;t find the enrollment process seamless, but in total it took me less than 15 minutes, and we&#8217;ve already established that I&#8217;m not gifted with the technical stuff. I enrolled my cellphone and tablet, and I also made sure to procure a <a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/mfa/enroll.html#token">token</a>, which is a quasi-magical device you can use to authenticate when you are out of the country or in a place where cell connection is unreliable or non-existent. This is particularly important for faculty who routinely do research abroad or in remote locations. If you&#8217;re planning to head elsewhere to do research this summer, for instance, you&#8217;ll definitely want to take a token, since the Google changeover to MFA will happen at some point during the summer months. Faculty and other researchers should enroll before leaving town to avoid any &#8230; frustrations. These tokens are also a suitable solution for students who may not own a smartphone.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks later, I will grudgingly admit I&#8217;ve found the MFA process has become pretty much second nature, especially now that I can authenticate once on each device every two weeks. The primary time commitment is in the initial enrollment of your phone and tablet, and (should you need one) procuring a token. Hitting a little green &#8220;allow&#8221; checkmark on my phone twice a month is annoying, but not really that annoying. There, I said it.</p>

It&#8217;s also valuable data for protecting the seals and understanding the ocean environment. <br/><br/>But weighing seals is difficult. They can be 10 feet long or more. They have to be sedated. A team of five or six work together to hang each seal in a sling from a portable scale. It&#8217;s dangerous and causes significant disturbance to the seal. <br/><br/>Diana Alvarado hopes that by analyzing pictures of the seals taken by a hovering drone, she can get accurate weight estimates. If it works, it would make it much easier and safer to gather this data.<br/><br/>&#8220;To be able to be part of that as an undergraduate is an amazing opportunity and truly a privilege,&#8221; says Alvarado (Merrill &#8216;19, marine biology).<br/><br/>During her senior year, Alvarado has made regular visits to the elephant seal rookery on the beach at the A&#241;o Nuevo Natural Reserve to collect drone images of seals. Comparing measurements in image analysis software to weight observations gathered by field researchers using the current method, she&#8217;s been developing a mathematical formula she hopes will provide reliable estimates.<br/><br/>She began participating in the Costa Lab's research the summer between her junior and senior years. The <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/packard/">STEM Diversity Program</a> provided a salary for an internship. Through that experience, she forged a connection with her advisor, Postdoctoral Researcher Roxanne Beltran, who has mentored her during the drone imaging project.<br/><br/>Scholarships from the <a href="https://koret.org/">Koret Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> enabled her to devote additional time to the project. Funds for the drone came from the Packard Endowment in Ocean Science and Technology.</p>
<p>Alvarado is the first in her family to attend university. She says peers in Rialto, where she grew up, wouldn&#8217;t consider marine biology as a possible career path.<br/><br/>&#8220;I can take that back and tell my family and tell my sisters and they almost don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; she says.<br/><br/>Alvarado plans to pursue a career in which she can continue researching marine mammals and introduce other students from underrepresented backgrounds to field research.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4721c7a38072701734bebd3c1ded0738"><name>may-bike-month</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Get Ready for Bike Month in May! </title><summary>UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) has joined with Ecology Action to celebrate Santa Cruz Bike Month starting on May 1, 2019.</summary><start-date>1555916400000</start-date><display-name>Get Ready for Bike Month in May! </display-name><path>/2019/04/may-bike-month</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/may-bike-month</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1555971556455</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1555971556455</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) has joined with Ecology Action to celebrate Santa Cruz Bike Month starting on May 1, 2019.

He was 71. He died very peacefully with family at his side.</p>
<p>We hope you will join us in keeping the Crow family in your thoughts at this difficult time, and in remembering Professor Crow&#8217;s dedication to justice and his innumerable and worldwide contributions to the field of sociology, his colleagues, and above all to his students. A <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/rememberingbencrow/home">memorial site is available to leave comments</a>.</p>
<p>Ben Crow was a professor in the Sociology Department at UCSC from 1996-2018, and department chair from 2011-2014. Before becoming a social scientist, Professor Ben Crow trained and worked as an engineer in London and Africa, and was an activist and volunteer in South Asia. His PhD is from Edinburgh University in Scotland, and he also taught at the Open University in the UK and at Stanford and UC Berkeley. He conducted research on conflict and cooperation over international rivers in South Asia, leading to a book entitled Sharing the Ganges: the politics and technology of river development; on traders, township markets and the making of social classes in rural Bangladesh (Markets, Class and Social Change: Trading Networks and Poverty in South Asia); on global inequalities (The UC Atlas of Global Inequality (online) and The Atlas of Global Inequalities, with Suresh Lodha). His most recent work studied how poor women, men and children gain access to water in urban slums in the global south, with a focus on cities in Kenya; and a comparative study of four cities to look at &#8216;urban capabilities and the transformation of women&#8217;s work.&#8217;</p>

While its main focus is former foster youths, Smith serves students from a range of adverse childhood experiences.<br/><br/>According to Casey Family Programs, only 2.5 percent of children who grow up in foster care graduate from a four-year college, while fewer than 2 percent of youth formerly in foster care complete a bachelor&#8217;s degree before the age of 25, compared with 24 percent of the general population.<br/><br/>On Alumni Weekend, at the end of April, <a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/cowell_capc#.XL5PcJNKjMU">the Smith Society celebrated its 20th anniversary</a>, while at the same time commemorating an extraordinary record: In contrast to that small percentage of foster youth nationwide who graduate from college, nearly all 483 Smith fellows over 20 years are on track to graduate or have earned a degree. <br/>
<h3>&#8216;Instant inclusion&#8217;</h3>
Emily Stone met her mentor, emeritus history professor Gary Miles, at a luncheon when she first joined the group. <br/><br/>&#8220;I was asking him questions about Smith and we just literally ended up telling each other our life stories,&#8221; Stone says. Miles, who was head of the Smith Society mentor program, offered to be her mentor on the spot. &#8220;I was like, &#8216;Oh cool! Instant inclusion.&#8217;&#8221;<br/><br/>That inclusion&#8212;being welcomed into in a community that understands what it means to grow up without traditional family support&#8212;is what many Smith Society alumni credit with their success at UC Santa Cruz. <br/><br/>Smith started in 1999, when Bill Dickinson (Cowell &#8216;68, philosophy) offered a scholarship that went to three students who had been in the foster system, naming it for Page and Eloise Smith, Cowell&#8217;s founding provost and his wife. A couple years later, Dickinson established the Smith Society. <br/>
<h3>$200,000 matching gift</h3>
Dickinson hopes the anniversary <a href="https://smithsociety.ucsc.edu/support-us/index.html">will bring out new financial support</a>. Smith&#8217;s scholarships, work-study, and other services are funded by private donations. A group of donors has put up a $200,000 matching gift, seeking to endow funding indefinitely.<br/><br/>The Smith Society directly addresses challenges that might otherwise become big obstacles. Scholarships help with finances. Work-study positions help fellows graduate with valuable job experience. Smith arranged permission for students who might be homeless to stay in their dorm rooms during school breaks. <br/><br/>Matilda Stubbs, one of the first fellows, recently completed a Ph.D. at Northwestern University and trains social workers. Stubbs (Porter &#8216;05, anthropology) says the key to the Smith Society&#8217;s effectiveness is bringing together students and alumni with common experiences. <br/><br/>&#8220;From the first meeting,&#8221; she says, &#8220;I felt a really profound sense of belonging, of understanding.&#8221; <br/><br/>It was a polar opposite from the bureaucracy and alienation Stubbs experienced moving from home to home as a foster youth. When she arrived on campus, she was dumbfounded when Smith invited her to join. Then she met with the other fellows and found a community that understood her background. <br/><br/>Since graduating, she has continued participating as a &#8220;senior fellow,&#8221; contributing to the cross-generational community that was important to her. <br/><br/>By bringing students together with alumni of all ages, Dickinson was drawing on an experience that was transformational for him. He came to UC Santa Cruz the year it opened, when a few hundred students shared a campus of a handful of buildings with faculty of all academic disciplines. Among them were Cowell College Provost Page Smith and his wife, artist Eloise Smith. <br/><br/>The Smiths were dedicated to nurturing community relationships among the new faculty and students of Cowell. Page Smith cared deeply for his students, Dickinson says. That care came in the form of life-changing guidance.<br/><br/>&#8220;He used his authority to connect you to what might move you along in your path in life,&#8221; Dickinson says &#8220;What I loved about going to Cowell is I left here feeling full of my own strengths and a sense of dignity.&#8221;<br/>
<h3>&#8216;Leading with your heart, reaching out, lifting as you climb&#8217;</h3>
At the weekly luncheon, across the table from from Stone, Cheryl Jones dives deep into conversation with one student after another, getting news about their lives, checking on their progress with classes.<br/><br/>Jones has been a part of Smith since it started. As a member of the staff in student support, she helped disburse the first scholarships. When it grew into a scholastic society, she helped with outreach to new students. Now retired, she volunteers. <br/><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned so much from our students,&#8221; Jones says. &#8220;Leading with your heart, reaching out, lifting as you climb. The majority want to help younger youth facing similar challenges to them.&#8221;<br/><br/>Nearby, Miguelcloid Reniva (Kresge &#8216;21, cognitive science) says that when he arrived at UC Santa Cruz, his background in the foster system was a source of alienation. With Smith, he found people with whom he could talk openly about his experience. <br/><br/>&#8220;At first I thought it was something I shouldn&#8217;t talk about,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I got used to saying I&#8217;m proudly foster youth.&#8221;<br/><br/>For Emily Stone, being a part of the Smith Society has meant adopting something similar to a family. The luncheons are a big part of that.<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s like having a Thanksgiving dinner every week with a bunch of aunts and uncles,&#8221; Stone says.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://smithsociety.ucsc.edu/support-us/index.html</url><title>Learn about opportunities to support the Smith Society</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="47bcd4468072701734bebd3c26c32a45"><name>hunicke-project-runway</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Arts professor Robin Hunicke appears on 'Project Runway' episode focused on female video game characters</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz arts professor Robin Hunicke made a special appearance on 'Project Runway' last week.

<p>She served as a guest judge on the popular reality television show for an episode where the participants were tasked with designing their own powerful female video game characters.</p>
<p>Hunicke is director of art and design for the Games and Playable Media B.A. program at UC Santa Cruz, as well as the acting director of the campus&#8217;s Digital Arts and New Media M.F.A. program.</p>
<p>She is also co-founder and CEO of the independent game design company, Funomena, which in late 2017 released her acclaimed PC and VR game, <em>Luna</em>.<br/><span> </span></p>
<p>Hunicke explained how she ended up on the show.</p>
<p>"Last fall, a <em>Project Runway</em> producer reached out to ask if I would be interested in helping out with a show that focused on games, and in particular, the need for strong female role models in games, tech and creative industries,&#8221; said Hunicke. &#8220;I have been a fan of this show for many years, and so I had to pinch myself.&#160;And then I said yes!"</p>
<p>"I care very much about these topics,&#8221; added Hunicke. &#8220;In fact, I developed the <a href="http://games.arts.ucsc.edu"><strong><em>Art, Games &amp; Playable Media BA</em></strong></a> at UC Santa Cruz in order to promote the participation of a more diverse population in games and tech. So it was an honor to be recognized for this and the trip out to New York was even better than I had imagined. I got to share my game <a href="https://luna.funomena.com"><strong><em>Luna</em></strong></a> with the designers, I got to talk with everyone about my work at <strong><em><a href="http://www.funomena.com">Funomena</a> </em></strong>and UCSC, and then...they asked me to stay for the weekend and be a guest judge."&#160;</p>
<p>Now in its 17th season with new supermodel host Karlie Kloss replacing original host Heidi Klum, the show received a Peabody Award in 2008 for using the reality TV genre to &#8220;engage, inform, enlighten, and entertain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kloss is also the founder of Kode With Klossy, a free coding camp she started in 2015 to empower teenage girls to learn to code and become leaders in tech.<span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>Hunicke said she was very impressed with everyone she met on the set of <em>Project Runway</em>, from the crew and staff to the judges, designers, and producers.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was clear that everyone is bought in to supporting diversity in tech, creative industries and fashion--especially Karlie,&#8221; said Hunicke. &#8220;We had many great conversations about the importance of showcasing women in tech and fashion, as well as the ways these things begin to blend as more and more people play games where dressing up is half the fun."</p>
<p>Hunicke noted that being on television was a bit surreal, but not quite as different from public speaking or giving a lecture as she thought it would be.</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly was a bit intimidating to be on screen, without a script, riffing with the other judges,&#8221; said Hunicke. &#8220;They are hilarious and also very sharp, and do a masterful job of balancing critique with humor and kindness--something I am lecturing on this quarter.&#160;I did my best, which as my students will tell you, is all we can ever do.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="513c41868072701734bebd3c852855a3"><name>air-pollution</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Air Resources District funds air pollution research and teaching at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>Partnership between UCSC and the Monterey Bay Air Resources District supports a new course on air pollution and research on high-tech sensors to detect pollutants.</summary><keywords>Peter Weiss-Penzias, Peter Weiss</keywords><start-date>1556521200000</start-date><display-name>Air Resources District funds air pollution research and teaching at UC Santa Cruz</display-name><path>/2019/04/air-pollution</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/air-pollution</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1556141063743</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1556550770627</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/course-poster-475.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/course-poster-475.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>course-poster-475.jpg</name><display-name>course-poster-475.jpg</display-name><file-size>145521</file-size><width>475</width><height>296</height></image><image-alt>course poster</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/air-pollution-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/air-pollution-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>air-pollution-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>air-pollution-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>46756</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>smokestacks</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Partnership between UCSC and the Monterey Bay Air Resources District supports a new course on air pollution and research on high-tech sensors to detect pollutants</article-subhead><article-text><p>A new upper division course on air pollution designed for students in the environmental sciences major has been made possible through a partnership between UC Santa Cruz and the <a href="http://mbard.org/">Monterey Bay Air Resources District</a> (MBARD), which is also supporting campus research on air quality sensors.</p>
<p>Environmental toxicologist Peter Weiss-Penzias, who is developing the new course (ESCI 122), said it will be offered for the first time in fall 2019 and will provide a broad survey of topics related to air pollution. Starting with the basic chemistry and physics of the atmosphere, the course will cover topics such as the life cycles of various pollutants, their health effects, the regulatory framework for air pollution, and engineering solutions and control measures.</p>
<p>Weiss-Penzias has also received a grant from MBARD to support his work on low-cost sensors for monitoring emissions of ethanol and other volatile organic compounds.</p>
<p>"The partnership is providing support in two important areas," Weiss-Penzias said. "The air pollution class fills a need for the new major in environmental sciences, and our work on sensor technology addresses an issue with ethanol emissions that was brought to our attention by the Air Resources District."</p>
<p><strong>Mutual benefits</strong></p>
<p>MBARD's air pollution control officer Richard Stedman said the partnership provides mutual benefits, and he anticipates more collaborations in the future.</p>
<p>"We want to take advantage of the research capabilities at UC Santa Cruz and the fact that we have this major research institution in our backyard," Stedman said. "We also want to generate awareness about the air quality agency among students, and there's a workforce development aspect to it as well, since MBARD is frequently looking to recruit air quality engineers and specialists."</p>
<p>Weiss-Penzias said he got to know MBARD officials through his research on mercury pollution and serving on a panel for the district's Clean Air Awards. Stedman told him about increasing concerns statewide regarding ethanol emissions from large winery operations, which led to the sensor technology project.</p>
<p>Large winemaking facilities can be major sources of air pollution, Stedman said. "Volatile organic compounds are a component of smog, and in sunlight and high temperatures they form ozone, so that's why we're concerned," he said. "New sensor technology could help us get a more accurate picture of the emissions."</p>
<p>The sensors are based on nanotechnology developed in the lab of Shaowei Chen, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. Mauricio Rojas-Andrade, who earned his Ph.D. in Chen's lab in 2017 and is now at UC Irvine, worked with Weiss-Penzias on the sensor technology, for which they have filed a patent application.</p>
<p>With the MBARD grant for the sensor project, the researchers were able to secure additional funding from UCSC's <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/iatc/commercialization-/services/launchpad-poc-grant-prog.html">Launchpad</a> program to support work on a proof-of-concept prototype device. Weiss-Penzias is advising a team of undergraduates in the Baskin School of Engineering who are building a device as their capstone project.</p>
<p>"Mauricio and I made a prototype sensor and showed that it works, and we're now working on a proprietary blend of nanoparticles to optimize the sensor," Weiss-Penzias said. "The students are making the actual device, building a chamber for sampling and developing all the electronics for processing the signal output from the sensor, wireless transmission, and so on."</p>
<p>While detecting ethanol emissions is the initial focus of the sensor project, the researchers plan to make the sensor tunable to detect other volatile organic compounds as well.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="51a2d68c8072701734bebd3ccb969575"><name>coral-reefs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>U.S. coral reefs provide flood protection worth $1.8 billion annually</title><summary>New report finds coral reef barriers provide flood protection for more than 18,000 people and $1.8 billion worth of coastal buildings, infrastructure, and economic activity yearly.</summary><keywords>Michael Beck, Borja Reguero</keywords><start-date>1556607600000</start-date><display-name>U.S. coral reefs provide flood protection worth $1.8 billion annually</display-name><path>/2019/04/coral-reefs</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/coral-reefs</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1556147786569</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1556653212100</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Paul Laustsen, USGS</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/cover-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/cover-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-410.jpg</name><display-name>cover-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>125173</file-size><width>410</width><height>496</height></image><image-alt>report cover image</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/cover-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/cover-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cover-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19075</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>report cover image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/map-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/map-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>map-400.jpg</name><display-name>map-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>86120</file-size><width>400</width><height>398</height></image><image-alt>map of protected areas on Maui</image-alt><image-caption>Map showing 100-year flood areas (with a 1 percent chance of a very large flood in any given year) on the coast of Maui, Hawaii.

<p>The study, funded in part by the U.S. Department of the Interior&#8217;s Office of Insular Affairs, will help managers take effective actions to reduce the risk of flooding and other hazards and increase the resiliency of coastal communities on the U.S. mainland and islands.</p>
<p>&#8220;We provide clear values of risk and reef benefit to inform key decisions in flood hazard mitigation, storm recovery spending, and coral reef management,&#8221; said coauthor Michael Beck, research professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Coral reefs are coastal barriers that can substantially reduce coastal flooding and erosion by reducing the energy of waves as they wash ashore. &#8220;Our goal in this study was to provide sound science to identify where, when, and how U.S. coral reefs provide the most significant coastal flood reduction benefits to ultimately save dollars and protect lives,&#8221; said first author Curt Storlazzi, a USGS research geologist.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed flood risk and assessed reef benefits for the populated U.S. reef-lined coasts of Hawaii, Florida, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is the first time that scientists have combined real-world computer models of storms and waves with engineering, ecological, mapping, and social and economic tools to create detailed, rigorous estimates of the value of coral reef defenses along U.S. mainland and insular area coastlines both in the long-term (annualized) and for more infrequent events such as 50- or 100-year storms.</p>
<p><strong>Localized threats forecast</strong></p>
<p>The study models can forecast localized threats to people and economic damage in areas with and without coral reefs at a 10-square-meter (108-square-feet) resolution along more than 3,100 kilometers (1,920 miles) of populated U.S. coral reef-lined shoreline.</p>
<p>&#8220;This approach represents a massive advance in the precision and resolution of flood risk assessment for ecosystems and in coral reef-lined areas, and is an approach that can be applied to other ecosystems, such as coastal vegetation,&#8221; said coauthor Borja Reguero, a research scientist at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;In addition, the modeling infrastructure can be used to assess the impacts of future changes in storms or sea level.&#8221;</p>
<p>The value of coastal flood risk reduction provided by coral reefs varies from location to location, primarily because of population density and the elevation of coastal areas. For example, coral reefs shield more than 3,300 people on Maui each year but just over 100 on Guam, where most housing and infrastructure is located at higher elevations because of the nearly constant threat of typhoons. Coral reefs annually protect $183 million worth of buildings and economic activity in Puerto Rico, $675 million in Florida, and $836 million in Hawaii.</p>
<p>These data, said Storlazzi, indicate that in the event of a 50-year storm (which has a 2 percent chance of occurring in any given year), the economic and protective benefits of coral reefs are even greater. In such a storm, for example, coral reefs off the heavily urbanized coast of Miami-Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, would provide more than $1.6 billion in protection, and off the coast of Honolulu, Hawaii, they would provide more than $435 million in protection.</p>
<p>The study also calculates how much critical infrastructure--such as hospitals, fire stations, roads, and power plants--coral reefs protect from coastal flooding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Information at this fine resolution is critical to coastal managers and planners working on flood mitigation, coastal defense, transportation, and hurricane response and recovery from the local to national scales,&#8221; said James Reilly, director of the USGS.</p>
<p>The new report, titled &#8220;<a href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20191027">Rigorously Valuing the Role of U.S. Coral Reefs in Coastal Hazard Risk Reduction</a>,&#8221; was conducted by scientists with the USGS, UC Santa Cruz, Nature Conservancy, and Deltares. It was funded by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of the Interior&#8217;s Office of Insular Affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Office was glad to collaborate with the USGS and leverage funds available through the Coral Reef and Natural Resources Initiative,&#8221; said Doug Domenech, U.S. Department of the Interior&#8217;s assistant secretary for insular and international affairs. &#8220;This highlights the important role that coral reefs play not only for coastal communities in the U.S. mainland but also in the U.S. insular areas. These research results will be of great interest to the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force, a body tasked to lead U.S. efforts on coral reef ecosystems, and that the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Department of Commerce chair jointly.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="564609f28072701734bebd3c736f772b"><name>vaske-aacr-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biologist Olena Vaske wins major grant from American Association for Cancer Research</title><summary>The 2019 AACR NextGen Grant for Transformative Cancer Research will support Vaske's research on pediatric cancer genomics.</summary><keywords>Olena Morozova Vaske</keywords><start-date>1556175600000</start-date><display-name>Biologist Olena Vaske wins major grant from American Association for Cancer Research</display-name><path>/2019/04/vaske-aacr-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/vaske-aacr-grant</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1556225590941</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1556226131082</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/olena-morozova-vaske-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/olena-morozova-vaske-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>olena-morozova-vaske-350.jpg</name><display-name>olena-morozova-vaske-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>86747</file-size><width>350</width><height>404</height></image><image-alt>Olena Morozova Vaske</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/olena-morozova-vaske-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/olena-morozova-vaske-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>olena-morozova-vaske-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>olena-morozova-vaske-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16947</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Olena Morozova Vaske</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Olena Morozova Vaske</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The 2019 AACR NextGen Grant for Transformative Cancer Research will support Vaske's research on pediatric cancer genomics</article-subhead><article-text><p>The <a href="https://www.aacr.org/Pages/Home.aspx">American Association for Cancer Research</a> (AACR) has awarded a prestigious 2019 NextGen Grant for Transformative Cancer Research to Olena Morozova Vaske, assistant professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The three-year, $450,000 grant will support Vaske's research on the use of genomic markers to guide treatment decisions for children with cancer. Vaske, who holds the Colligan Presidential Chair in Pediatric Genomics, said the project aims to increase the number of pediatric cancer patients who could benefit from targeted therapies.</p>
<p>Vaske's team has developed a novel RNA sequencing analysis that can reveal abnormally active genes in a patient's cancer cells. The researchers plan to identify highly expressed genes that could be targeted with drugs and study the biological effects of those genes. They will also evaluate whether the increased expression of these genes is predictive of how the cells respond to cancer-fighting drugs.</p>
<p>Another part of the project will use nanopore sequencing technology developed by UCSC biomolecular engineers David Deamer and Mark Akeson. Working with Akeson's lab, Vaske's team will use the technology to profile cancer cell lines and identify the genetic changes responsible for abnormal gene expression patterns.</p>
<p>The new project builds on work Vaske began as a cofounder of the <a href="https://treehousegenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative</a> when she was a postdoctoral researcher in the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.</p>
<p>"Tumor gene expression analysis using RNA sequencing remains under-utilized clinically," Vaske said. "We hope to develop predictive biomarkers that can be incorporated into targeted treatment approaches for pediatric cancer patients."</p>
<p>The AACR NextGen Grants for Transformative Cancer Research represent the AACR&#8217;s flagship funding initiative to stimulate highly innovative research from young investigators. Founded in 1907, the AACR is the oldest and largest scientific organization focused on cancer research.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="566b21f88072701734bebd3c33afe76e"><name>stephen-mccabe-succulent-savior-feature</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Succulent savior</title><summary>Climate change and poachers are wreaking havoc with a rare and enigmatic plant, but researcher Stephen McCabe is part of an ambitious effort to save it from extinction. &#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An experienced climber and a researcher with UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Environmental Studies Department, McCabe was part of a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service project to ensure the survival of the rare silvery-green succulent, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verity&#8217;s</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudleya</span></em><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which had been nearly wiped out by the 2013 Springs Fire and then hit by alleged poachers a while later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure enough, McCabe, who is also emeritus director of research at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum and Botanic Garden, found a subpopulation of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verity&#8217;s</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dudleya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the cliff face, marking a small victory in the fight to preserve this federally protected plant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it&#8217;s not just </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verity&#8217;s</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dudleya</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s in trouble. Many species of <em>D</em></span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">udleya</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are being endangered, not only by climate change and but also by bands of poachers who have stolen thousands of the these plants. A single mature <em>Dudleya</em> currently can cost up to $50 on the black market in China and South Korea, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</span></p>
<p><strong>The &#8216;panda bear of plants&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is McCabe considered an expert on the <em>D</em></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">udleya,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is the panda bear of plants&#8212;cute, charismatic, and rare&#8212;but he also is at the forefront of efforts to save the succulent. He consults with state and federal agencies, has helped safely replant some of the wild </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudleya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stolen by poachers, and has collected thousands of seeds from the threatened plants. Some of the seeds, like those from Ventura County, have been placed in seed banks to preserve them in case of extinction. But others from different species have been cultivated by McCabe, who harvests seeds from those plants, and then gives them away to nurseries and organizations in hopes of smothering the succulent smuggling trade. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, for instance, McCabe donated tens of thousands of seeds to the California Native Plant Society, which is planning a huge </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudleya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plant giveaway this fall in an effort to not only raise awareness of succulent poachers and responsible sourcing but also to flood the market and drive down prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says McCabe with a quick grin: &#8220;We want to make them (<em>D</em></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">udleya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) cheap and boring.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An energetic 65-year-old with a mane of collar-length hair stuffed under a Patagonia ball cap, McCabe is a man on a mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He became fascinated with succulents at the age of 11, got twin degrees from UC Santa Cruz (Cowell &#8217;77, environmental studies and psychology, and Crown &#8217;82, biology), and decided to study the then-obscure </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudleya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while at graduate school at San Francisco State University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"They are a fascinating plant group,&#8221; McCabe says. &#8220;Not only are there a great number of rare and endangered species but there is a lot going on with their evolution. They haven&#8217;t stopped evolving.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can go into a population and, in some cases, find incipient species that, if left alone, might become a new species thousands of years from now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which makes them not only a worthy specimen for study but also makes them hard to classify&#8212;although McCabe has been known to be able to look at a photo and determine within 100 yards where the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudleya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is growing. </span></p>
<p><strong>A trendy obsession</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popularly called liveforevers&#8212;in the late 1800s, a Scottish explorer discovered, to his surprise, that the plants he&#8217;d pressed between the pages of his field book in the Americas had somehow survived the long ocean voyage back to Britain&#8212;the plants are hardy but rare. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Found mostly on the West Coast from the southern Oregon border to the tip of Baja California, there are 68 species and subspecies in the genus </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudleya,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to McCabe. Of those, 39 are considered rare and/or endangered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They&#8217;re extremely tenacious in the right spots,&#8221; McCabe says. &#8220;You can see them hanging by a single root. The cliff may have fallen away but they have one root hanging on, and they&#8217;re still making it. You look at them and think, there is no way they can be alive, but they will somehow pull out one more season of flowering and seeds.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, drought and fire have taken a toll&#8212;the Springs Fire, for instance, wiped out 95&#8211;99 percent of all known </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verity&#8217;s</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dudleya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to Mark Elvin, a botanist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Ventura County&#8212;and the popularity of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudleyas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in places like China and South Korea have put more pressure on them. In those countries, according to news reports, the plants&#8217; resemblance to a lotus blossom and its ability to grow in small gardens and apartments have made them a trendy obsession. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of poached plants have been recovered by California and federal authorities in recent years. According to the Monterey County District Attorney&#8217;s Office, in 2019, a couple was convicted of stealing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudleya farinosa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plants from Big Sur and was fined $24,000 and handed jail sentences. Some 600 plants destined for China were reportedly found in their home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 100 of the poached plants were replanted in Big Sur by McCabe, UC Santa Cruz California Native Plant Program Director Brett Hall, UC Santa Cruz students, and state parks employees. But that&#8217;s not the solution for every poaching case. According to McCabe, smugglers will often mix species from different areas and put them in soil taken from another location so there is a real threat that, if replanted in the wild, bugs, fungus and/or bacteria could be introduced and not only wipe out the replanted </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudleya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but also the wild populations there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, McCabe&#8217;s effort to collect seeds and cultivate </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudleya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plants, which, in the wild, are a critical part of ecosystems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right now, Steve is just maintaining the plants (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verity&#8217;s</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dudleya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) so we have as many individuals as possible so if the plant dies in the wild, we have the genetic material,&#8221; says botanist Elvin of the Ventura County conservation project. He noted that McCabe was hired for the job because of his deep knowledge of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudleya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and his horticulture skills. </span></p>
<p><strong>Fighting off extinction</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fight to save </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudleya,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Elvin says, is similar to the way California condors were brought back from the edge of extinction starting in 1982. That year, the remaining wild population of 23 condors was put into a captive breeding program, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and then released into the wild starting in 1992. Although the California condor is still endangered, there are now hundreds living in the wild or in captivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re not quite at the point of putting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verity&#8217;s</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dudleya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back into the wild,&#8221; Elvin says. But it&#8217;s a possibility in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, McCabe and UC Santa Cruz are at the forefront of efforts to save the enigmatic </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudleya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from extinction with its program of seed banking and cultivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s important for the world to see there is value in what is going on at the university, and specifically at the Arboretum,&#8221; McCabe says. &#8220;This is real-world conservation, where there can be a positive ending to the story&#8221; about another group of plants on Earth facing extinction. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="56a71f4e8072701734bebd3c9a0450fa"><name>anti-semitism-internet</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Night at the Museum in Silicon Valley to spotlight Anti-Semitism and the Internet</title><summary>What is the relationship between anti-Semitism and the Internet?

<p>Is there something new about anti-Semitism today or is it just a continuation of old images and fears?</p>
<p>How do social media platforms create environments for the viral spread of global anti-Semitism?</p>
<p>Does the Internet deepen the conspiracies that lie behind anti-Semitism?</p>
<p>And how can members of the tech community harness new technologies against such hatred?</p>
<p>On Thursday, May 9, The Humanities Institute and the Center for Jewish Studies will present <strong>UC Santa Cruz Night at the Museum<em>: Anti-Semitism &amp; the Internet&#8212;Old Hatred and New</em></strong>, at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, beginning at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>The evening will feature a conversation about these questions and more with UC Santa Cruz professor of history <strong>Nathaniel Deutsch </strong>and <strong>Rachel Deblinger</strong>, founding director of the Digital Scholarship Commons at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Professor Deutsch is also the director of the Center for Jewish Studies at UC Santa Cruz. He explained the origins of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anti-Semitism has been called the world's oldest hatred because it is grounded in much earlier forms of anti-Judaism that demonized Jews--sometimes literally--on religious grounds,&#8221; Deutch noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modern anti-Semitism, however, really originates in the 19th century and is made possible by a number of factors--most importantly, the emergence of race theory and the racialization of Jews; the dual emergence of modern capitalism and communism, for which the Jews are blamed; and the rise of modernity itself, for which the Jews are blamed as well.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>Deutsch added that many of the anti-Semitic images and ideas that circulate on the Web today have been around for decades, if not centuries, but have now been given a second life on the Internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Internet has the potential to amplify certain key aspects of anti-Semitism, most notably, the idea that Jews are engaged in a conspiracy to gain power and control,&#8221; said Deutsch. &#8220;It is well documented at this point that the Internet is both fertile ground and a powerful instrument for generating and disseminating conspiracies, including anti-Semitic ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Internet also enables anti-Semites to communicate with one another, create new anti-Semitic memes and adapt older ones,&#160;spread hate virally, feel a sense of community with like-minded individuals around the globe, and be exposed to a great deal of misinformation that reinforces or even initiates their anti-Semitic thinking,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><strong>Deutsch observed that in recent years</strong>, social media platforms have helped to create new forms of anti-Jewish hatred, as well as to magnify age-old propaganda and conspiracy theories, such as the <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/protocols-of-the-elders-of-zion"><strong><em>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em></strong></a><strong><em>,</em></strong> and pass them on to a new and wider audience</p>
<p>&#8220;One of my main concerns is that through&#160;clicking&#160;on links and belonging to certain social media networks, individuals--especially children and young adults who don't even know what anti-Semitism is--may become exposed to it and may not be in a position to counter the false claims they've&#160;inadvertently come across,&#8221; said Deutsch.</p>
<p>&#8220;That's why it's so important for websites that have accurate information about the Holocaust and the history of anti-Semitism to exist and provide an alternative in the&#160;virtual landscape.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Anti-Semitism has additionally been linked to the recent rise of white nationalism and intensely partisan politics around the world. Many believe that the new populist leaders in such places as the U.S. and Europe are helping to&#160;&#8220;legitimize&#8221;&#160;all forms of hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Historically, there have been many connections between different kinds of hatred, especially those grounded in racial&#8212;and racist&#8212;distinctions and hierarchies,&#8221; said Deutsch. &#8220;For example, it is well known that the Nazis committed genocide against Jews and Roma on racial grounds, but much less known that they also persecuted Afro-Germans and African prisoners of war for the same reason. In general, contemporary white nationalism has strong links to anti-Semitism, though not all white nationalists identify as such, and not all forms of &#8216;populism&#8217; are anti-Semitic.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>There are a number of actions</strong> that can be taken to combat the rise of anti-Semitism. But Deutch noted that he thought it was very important for scholars of anti-Semitism to work closely with members of the tech community to fight against it and related forms of hatred toward others.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do know that whatever approach is taken, it has to include a deep knowledge of the history&#160;of anti-Semitism and not just information about its current manifestations,&#8221; said Deutsch. &#8220;As an educator, I try to teach students, community members, and others how anti-Semitism works in a structural sense, in addition to helping them to identify instances of the phenomenon and its impacts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is ideally situated to lead the conversation on this topic because of our geographic proximity to Silicon Valley, our tradition of thinking outside the box, and our strong and digitally savvy Jewish Studies Program,&#8221; Deutsch added.</p>
<p>This event is presented as part of the&#160;<strong><em>The Humanities Institute&#8217;s</em></strong>&#160;<a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/initiatives/data-and-democracy/"><strong><em>Data and Democracy initiative</em></strong></a>, a project of&#160;the Expanding Humanities, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Deutsch and Deblinger are co-directors of the Digital Jewish Studies Initiative at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacey Sketo-Rosener will never forget the time when former </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Secretary of State Leon Panetta urged UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s graduating class of 1988 to recognize their privilege and understand their obligation to give back.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panetta, who served as President Bill Clinton&#8217;s chief of staff, and later headed the CIA, exhorted the crowd to contribute meaningfully to society and give generously of themselves. That call to action informs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sketo-Rosener&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> life and career, which is all about helping UC Santa Cruz students follow their hearts and overcome obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Sketo-Rosener (Kresge &#8217;88, literature), UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s assistant vice provost for undergraduate advising, is being recognized with UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 2019 Outstanding Staff Award, honoring distinguished service to student life, the growth and improvement of programs, and the preservation of the campus&#8217;s unique intellectual environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sketo-Rosener leads the campus&#8217;s Office of Campus Advising Coordination, which&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offers support for academic advising on campus, as well as programs for training and development of advisers, including an adviser certificate program. Her office is leading a campus-wide effort to host a systemwide UC advising conference this spring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We try to create and support an environment where effective academic advising can take place, whether it&#8217;s policy, procedure, training, or development,&#8221; she explained. Her office also has peer academic success coaches that work with students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sketo-Rosener said that receiving the Outstanding Staff Award &#8220;kind of came out of the blue. I was happy and surprised. I really want to know who nominated me. I wanted to know who to thank.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also said this praise is especially gratifying because it validates her office&#8217;s work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re working really hard to help move academic advising from transactional to transformational work,&#8221; she said. In other words, her office is working to help advisers spend more time talking with the students about their goals, their majors and minors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the week she found out about the award, her thoughts turned to her time at UC Santa Cruz and how it informed her desire to do good, impactful work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Panetta speech came to mind. So did the time when, at the same commencement ceremony, she was approached by a group of fellow students who asked her to sign a mission statement that encouraged her to consider the sociopolitical ramifications of any employment she found after college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That statement was so old UC Santa Cruz, but I took it seriously,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think the work we are doing at UC Santa Cruz is good work. I am a big believer in public education and the way it can basically transform people&#8217;s lives&#8212;and not just their lives but the generations that come after them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you think about historically marginalized populations getting educations&#8212;that can make a huge difference for generations to come,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;The university has been referred to as a great equalizer. Those are the values that influence me. We can make a big social difference.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her work on behalf of students made her stand out in a pool of 150 Outstanding Staff Award nominees this year. And her letters of recommendation are packed with impressive specifics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Stacey has been an incredibly productive and collaborative campus partner for decades,&#8221; wrote UC Santa Cruz Associate Director of Academic Advising Danielle Mello in one of many letters of recommendation on behalf of Sketo-Rosener.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer Gallacher, marketing and communications director for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Summer Session, noted Sketo-Rosener&#8217;s amazing productivity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Stacey works tirelessly for the students and staff at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; she stated in her recommendation letter. &#8220;Always open to new ideas, she is continually raising the bar. Stacey is always in meetings! She meets with staff, students, deans, provosts, and everyone in between, but she still manages to get more done for UC Santa Cruz than most people you will meet. Even with her busy schedule, she can always make time for a chat; she is extremely approachable, and always makes you feel heard.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz staff will have their day in the sun at the annual Staff Appreciation Picnic on April 30, 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at the campus&#8217;s East Field. Sketo-Rosener can not attend the ceremony because of a work commitment, but Sean Malone, who works in her office, will accept the award on her behalf. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5a8ffe318072701734bebd3cf0633f79"><name>demonstration-updates</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus status updates — possible demonstrations</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is anticipating potential demonstration activities on Wednesday, May 1.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is anticipating potential demonstration activities on Wednesday, May 1.</p>
<p>No formal labor action is planned, but May 1 is International Workers Day, which has drawn demonstrations to campus in the past. Flyers posted around campus also suggest demonstrators will be active again this year. This is an advisory to be prepared and to stay informed.</p>
<p>At this time it is unknown how these activities will impact campus; as we have seen in the past, demonstrations may result in peaceful expression or may include impeding vehicle access to campus, marching around campus or through buildings, and interfering with university business.</p>
<p>Students concerned with how May Day activities might impact their classes, or getting to classes, are urged to speak to their instructors. Instructors are strongly encouraged to speak with their department chair regarding contingency plans should classroom access be impacted.</p>
<p>Staff supervisors and managers should discuss contingency plans with staff ahead of May 1. When appropriate, contingency plans may include telecommuting and alternate work-site arrangements. In any situation of imminent danger, people should call 911.</p>

Smoke is not expected to be noticeable on main campus, though it will likely be evident on north campus. Pile burns are tightly controlled and typically produce less smoke than prescribed burns. However, persons susceptible to smoke are advised to avoid the area.<br/><br/>Cal Fire officials report that crews are making good progress on the burns, and aim to wrap them up over the next week or so.&#160;<br/><br/>The pile burns are part of an effort to control vegetation on and around campus, which reduces fire risk.

<p>Faber, a professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, was recognized &#8220;for her contributions to the study of galaxy formation and evolution, which have transformed our understanding of these building blocks of the Universe and set the agenda for years to come. From the discovery of the Faber-Jackson relation to her fundamental contributions to the cold dark matter theory of galaxy formation, she has made galaxy formation and evolution a quantitative science.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faber has been one of the leading optical astronomers since the 1970s, and her contributions have changed the study of galaxies from a qualitative to a quantitative science. Her observations and analysis showed the quantitative relations among mass, size, velocity dispersion, stellar populations, and resident black holes in the massive elliptical galaxies that are the bedrock of extragalactic astronomy. Among the earliest observers to recognize the prevalence and importance of dark matter, she also was among the earliest to note how feedback from supernova winds would alter the evolution of galaxies. Her numerous prescient contributions form the basis on which modern understanding of galaxy evolution now stands.</p>
<p>Faber has received many awards and honors for her work, including the National Medal of Science in 2013. She was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2001.</p>
<p>The Magellanic Premium Medal was established in 1786 from a gift of 200 guineas by John Hyacinth de Magellan of London, &#8220;for a gold medal to be awarded from time to time under prescribed terms, to the author of the best discovery or most useful invention relating to navigation, astronomy, or natural philosophy (mere natural history only excepted).&#8221; First awarded in 1790, it is the oldest medal recognizing scientific achievements given by a North American institution.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6a6adcd38072701734bebd3cc20b0115"><name>langhout-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Regina Langhout honored for advocacy on behalf of those at risk of deportation </title><summary>Regina Langhout, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is being recognized for her leadership in community psychology on behalf of people at risk of deportation.</summary><keywords>langhout, deportation, migration</keywords><start-date>1556521200000</start-date><display-name>Langhout-Award</display-name><path>/2019/04/langhout-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/langhout-award</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1556563548578</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1556563548578</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/langhout_350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/langhout_350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>langhout_350.jpg</name><display-name>langhout_350.jpg</display-name><file-size>61062</file-size><width>350</width><height>314</height></image><image-alt>Regina Langhout</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/langhout_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/langhout_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>langhout_80.jpg</name><display-name>langhout_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>8237</file-size><width>79</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Regina Langhout</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Regina Langhout (Photo by Kathy Montano)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Award recognizes leadership in community psychology</article-subhead><article-text><p>Regina Langhout, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is being recognized for her leadership in community psychology on behalf of people at risk of deportation.</p>
<p>Langhout took the lead drafting a recent <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajcp.12256">policy statement</a> on deportation that called for changes to U.S. policy. The statement, based on a review of the effects of three decades of U.S. immigration policy on individuals, families, and communities, outlined the negative psychosocial and economic impacts of deportation. The brief was issued by the <a href="http://www.scra27.org/">Society for Community Research and Action</a> (SCRA) and published in the <em>American Journal of Community Psychology</em>.</p>
<p>In recognition of her leadership, Langhout will receive the 2019 Special Contributions to Community Psychology Award from the SCRA, Division 27 of the American Psychological Association. The award will be presented in June during the <a href="http://www.scra27.org/event/biennial-conference/2019-biennial/">Biennial Conference on Community Research and Action</a>, which takes place in Chicago.</p>
<p>The Society recognized Langhout "for her courageous leadership and exemplary action on behalf of individuals, families, and communities at risk of deportation and family separation. Her actions have had local and national impacts."</p>
<p>Following the publication of the policy statement, Langhout reached out to local immigration attorneys, various bar associations, elected officials, immigrant rights advocacy groups, and researchers, using media and social media to spread the word. She also authored an op-ed for the <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em> about how communities can support immigrants who lack authorization, and she was interviewed by local NPR affiliate KAZU Radio. Media coverage led to several invitations to address local community groups.</p>
<p>The Society also recognized UC Santa Cruz alumna Erin Ellison (Ph.D. '17, psychology) with its 2019 SCRA Emory L. Cowen Award for the Promotion of Wellness. In her dissertation, "Collaborative Competence and Relational&#160;Praxis Among Community Organizers: The Reproduction of, and Resistance to, Systems of&#160;Oppression," Ellison looked at union organizing as a means of addressing oppression, with a focus on how building social support and group cohesion contributes to making socially just change. Ellison, who is now an assistant professor of psychology at Sacramento State University, maintains that organizers must recognize racism,&#160;classism, and sexism and their roles reproducing it to foster truly empowering coalitions. Langhout served as chair of Ellison's dissertation committee.

"Drawing and painting plants is a really useful way to remember them," said Bell. "If you spend time carefully observing and drawing something, you really commit it to memory." Bell's illustrations in the book are mostly watercolor-and-ink, a technique that he found useful for the field guide. "Watercolor and ink is a faster way to define features and edges than more traditional botanical illustrations that use watercolor with pencil," said Bell, who worked from photographs, as well as in the field. Bell discovered his interest in plants as an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz, where he learned about the tremendous biodiversity in California. "Where we live is really unique," he said. "This area is one of the few biodiversity hotspots outside of the tropics." California is home to approximately 6,500 plant species&#8212;"That's more than the Eastern United States and Canada combined," he hastened to add. Since graduating from UCSC, Bell has pieced together a patchwork of jobs in outdoor education, art, science, and higher education. He credits the publication of the field guide&#160;with inspiring him to earn a certificate from the prestigious <a href="https://csumb.edu/scienceillustration">science illustration program</a> at California State University Monterey Bay. Of the field guide, Bell said, "I feel so lucky to be a part of it. A book was kind of a life goal." Then he shared an aspiration: "More of that to come, I hope. Maybe I'll make my own field guide that's fully illustrated one day."

<p>Dozens of less familiar blooms will emerge in coming weeks and months, and a beautiful, full-color&#160;<a href="https://eposweb-721.sequoiars.com/ePOS?form=shared3/gm/merch.html&amp;item_number=2801983977161&amp;cat=4&amp;store=721&amp;design=721">&#160;<em>Field Guide to Plants of UC Santa Cruz</em></a> makes exploring the landscapes of the campus&#8212;and the county&#8212;fun and rewarding.</p>
<p>The guide was a labor of love for author Nathalie Martin (College Nine '17, environmental studies), who hopes the 173-page volume filled with photographs, maps, and tips will inspire others to build their knowledge of local plants "and all the curiosities and wonders that accompany them."</p>
<p>"This project was sort of like a botanical treasure hunt for me," said Martin, who became involved with the project during a winter-quarter internship her sophomore year, during which she explored, identified, and photographed plants all over campus.</p>
<p>Smitten, Martin did two more internships and devoted countless volunteer hours to the project, ultimately overseeing the entire production, from writing to design and layout. "There's nothing like having the physical copy of the book in your hand after seeing it on the screen for so long," said Martin.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for undergraduates at UC Santa Cruz to coauthor, or contribute to, papers that appear in academic journals. It's far less common to write a book. "I didn't anticipate taking on the whole thing, but at a certain point, I said, 'I want to see this through,' " recalled Martin.</p>
<p>The guide is valuable for novices, as well as those with greater knowledge of plants. Each entry features three or four photos, a description of the plant, and notes about its abundance, height, blooming season, size, and locations on campus. The index lists both Latin and common names, a lengthy glossary defines terms, and detailed campus maps show different vegetation communities, from chaparral and coastal prairie to redwood forest, as well as "botanical hotspots."</p>
<p>Illustrator Brett Bell (Cowell College '12, environmental studies and biology) contributed beautiful paintings, as well as illustrations of leaf shapes and the parts of a flower, and other features that aid identification (see sidebar).</p>
<p>"It adds so much to the book to have these illustrations," said Martin. "I didn't want it to be just a sterile book, but something that&#8217;s enjoyable and inspiring for readers to look at and use."</p>
<p>Martin is loathe to name a favorite plant, but when pressed, she mentions large-flowered mariposa, or <em>Calochortus uniflorus</em>, a photo of which adorns the cover of the field guide. "It's so striking, with those blue anthers," she marvels. "Each species within the genus is like a detailed little work of art."</p>
<p>Martin appreciates the Latin names of plants, but she values how descriptive and useful common names are. For example, <em>Scoliopus bigelovii</em> doesn't begin to convey what the common name fetid adder's tongue does: "It's stinky but beautiful," she said of the delicate, lily-like plant with maroon- and white-striped petals. "They are pollinated by gnats, which are attracted to the fetid stench."</p>
<p><em>Latest in a series of campus field guides</em></p>
<p>The field guide is part of a series of natural history field guides being produced by the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve, following student-authored books about<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/07/spider-guide.html"> spiders</a>, birds, fungus, slime molds, and ethnobotany. It features 185 plants found on campus, most of which thrive throughout the county. While flowering plants make up the majority of the plants listed, trees and ferns are also included.</p>
<p>Campus Natural Reserve manager Alex Jones supervised Martin on the project, from her first internship through the many hours she volunteered to bring it to fruition. "She was thoughtful about her process, had photography skills, and she was really interested in the plants themselves," he said. "She's a quick learner and took the time to actually learn how to identify plants."</p>
<p>Jones approached Martin about writing the book, and he credits her with having the dedication, patience, and desire to see the project through. &#160;"We were lucky to have her stick with it," he said. "We got really lucky with Brett, too. He was building up his portfolio and basically donated his illustrations. They are a great complement. They really liven it up."</p>
<p><em>From Dallas to Santa Cruz</em></p>
<p>Martin grew up in Dallas and knew she wanted to go to college in the west. After visiting schools in Oregon, Washington, California, and Colorado, UC Santa Cruz emerged as her top choice. "I always loved spending time outside when I was growing up, and for me, the biggest draw was just the setting," she said. "It's really important being in a place I can enjoy and explore. Having the forest by the ocean was foreign to me, and really exciting."</p>
<p>The diverse landscapes of campus called to Martin, who quickly felt compelled to "dive into studying them in some way." She enrolled in botany classes, internships, and field courses that fed her desire to learn about plants.</p>
<p>"Natural History Field Quarter was hands down my favorite class," Martin said of a quarter-long Environmental Studies class during which students explore California's different landscapes, from the Mojave Desert and the Sierra to Big Sur and the Eel River in Mendocino County. Martin soaked up the opportunity to study those places in depth&#8212;and get academic credit for it.</p>
<p>The book project and Martin's classes honed her skills as an observer of the natural world. "The big thing I took away is slowing down and paying attention to the little things that are so easy to overlook, especially in this crazy, fast-paced world we're living in, where we&#8217;re rarely taught to slow down and appreciate what is around us," she said.</p>
<p>"Nathalie took her education into her own hands," said Jones. "She really took advantage of all the opportunities. I'm super proud of her."</p>
<p>The book is likely the most comprehensive guide to plants in Santa Cruz County, yet it remains a "work in progress," said Jones, noting that its 185 plants are only a portion of more than 500 species that grow on campus.</p>
<p>"I'd love for someone to build on it one day," added Martin. The book does not include grasses, rushes, or sedges&#8212;something she acknowledged in the book's introduction, where she extended an invitation of sorts: "Are you, dear reader, the one who will create the second edition of this guide?"</p>

<p>The line-up of speakers for Diverse Voices includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eron Lake, software engineer at Yahoo! (April 17)</li>
<li>Andrew McCree, software engineer at Twitter (April 24)</li>
<li>Jacob Martinez, executive director of Digital NEST (May 1)</li>
<li>Laura Gomez, chief executive officer and founder of Atipica (May 8)</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;We wanted different people in the industry who have found success and are advocates for students of color and diverse populations,&#8221; said Lindy Boisvert, programs assistant for undergraduate advising in the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>The events begin with pizza at 4:30 p.m. followed by an interview-style presentation moderated by a Baskin student or alum and a question-and-answer session with students from 5&#8211;7 p.m. The talks take place at the Baskin Events Center (Engineering 2, Room 180) and are co-sponsored by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.</p>
<p>On May 22, there will be speaker panel discussion on &#8220;Out in Engineering&#8221; organized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Students who attend get a chance to interact with industry professionals and learn from strong role models in the tech industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Baskin Engineering, we&#8217;re focused on widening the pipeline into engineering programs and the tech industry for women and other groups that are vastly underrepresented in engineering,&#8221; said Dean Alexander Wolf. &#8220;We are motivated to increase the number of female engineers, engineers of color, LGBTQ engineers in our classrooms and labs&#8212;not only to bring the wonderful opportunities that engineering offers to a wider audience, but also because diverse teams do better work: They design better solutions and they understand problems from more diverse perspectives.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Abigail Kaun, special assistant to the dean, initiatives like <em>Diverse Voices</em> can help students from underrepresented groups understand that they belong in engineering and can have an impact on technology.</p>
<p>Of the 4,374 total undergraduate students in engineering majors in fall 2018, 78 percent self-identify as male and 21 percent as female, which corresponds to the national averages (77 percent men, 22.9 percent women) tracked by the American Society for Engineering Education</p>
<p>In terms of race and ethnicity, the largest group of students self-identifies as Asian (36 percent), with the next largest group (26 percent) self-identifying as white. Additionally, 16 percent self-identify as Latinx, which is higher than the national average of 13.7 percent. However only 2 percent self-identify as African American, compared to the national average of 5 percent.</p>
<p>Martinez, who speaks Wednesday, earned undergraduate degrees in ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and a master&#8217;s degree from California State University, Monterey Bay. He created Digital NEST to give opportunities in tech to under-represented young people in Watsonville and Salinas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often, kids from those communities are low-income and don&#8217;t have the resources to learn about technology on their own,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Digital NEST gives youth from high school to age 24 free access to computers, software, wi-fi, and state-of-the-art digital tools and classes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tech industry has been dominated by white men for years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The environment they create in the university setting is not welcoming to people of color and women. Things are changing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gomez, the last speaker of the series, received her undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley and her master&#8217;s degree at UC San Diego. She founded Atipica, a tech company that helps businesses build truly diverse and inclusive workplaces. The firm&#8217;s clients include Eventbrite, Netflix, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Gomez is also a founding member of Project Include, a nonprofit that works to give everyone a fair chance to succeed in tech. She was named one of the Frederick Douglass 200, a project to honor the impact of 200 living individuals who best embody the work and spirit of Douglass.</p>
<p>McCree, who spoke last week, was born in Los Angeles and recently earned his bachelor of science degree in computer science at UC Santa Cruz. He works on Twitter&#8217;s search infrastructure team, which operates the indexes behind the ranked home timeline, recommendations, consumer search and more. McCree states that he &#8220;actively works toward understanding failed diversity efforts in tech, while working with industry leaders to ensure that creating a diverse work environment is not only prioritized but executed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eron Lake, a Yahoo! software engineer, gave the first talk in the series April 17. Lake grew up in San Jose and earned a degree in computer science and game design at UC Santa Cruz. He worked as an associate software engineer at Verizon Media/Yahoo Sports and as a gameplay programmer at an independent virtual reality company. He is working on his own virtual reality game.</p>

<div>We want to provide an update about measles. There has been an outbreak of measles reported at UCLA and in other areas of California. We have had no cases of measles at UC Santa Cruz. There has been one case of measles reported in Santa Cruz County. Three measles cases were confirmed in the Bay Area, all linked to the same international flight that landed at SFO in February. The person who was contagious with measles during the flight was a Santa Cruz County resident. This person did not re-enter Santa Cruz County while infectious. The two other cases are San Francisco and Santa Clara County residents. Public health investigators investigated all three cases and controlled the outbreak; there is no evidence indicating that measles is spreading further within the impacted counties. Since January 2019, the state of California has identified 21 cases of measles from 10 California counties. One of these cases involved a student at UCLA.<br/><br/>Our current focus is on measles prevention. The measles vaccination (MMR) is very effective. In 2017 and 2018 we began to require all incoming students to show us that they had received 2 MMR vaccinations or proof of immunity by blood testing. For students who arrived on campus prior to this requirement we encourage you to find your vaccination records or discuss getting a blood test to confirm your immunity. Students who need this vaccination can contact the Student Health Center at 831-459-2500.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>What are the symptoms of measles and where should you go to get evaluated?</strong>Measles begins with a fever that lasts for a couple of days, followed by a cough, runny nose, and conjunctivitis (pink eye). A rash appears three to five days after symptoms start, usually beginning as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet.<br/><br/>If you have reason to think you have measles due to a high fever, rash, and serious illness you should seek care. For students, call the Student health Center at 831-459-2591 and speak to the Advice Nurse. We will arrange to see you. For faculty and staff, call your primary care provider to discuss the best way to be seen.&#160;<br/><br/>According to the California Department of Public Health the highest risk to our university campus is the risk of international travel. If faculty, staff or students intend to travel internationally we strongly encourage you to be sure your immunizations are up to date.&#160;<br/><br/>The UCSC Student Health Center works in close collaboration with our local and state Health Departments under a Communicable Disease Response process.

<p>The all-day lobbying trip to Sacramento on April 13 included meetings with California Senator Bill Monning, Assemblymember Mark Stone and senior advisors to Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins. In all, the campus delegation met with 15 different lawmakers or key staff members.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a great opportunity to tell our story, to give legislators a glimpse at how we are changing the lives not only of our students but of their families and entire communities,&#8221; said Chancellor George Blumenthal. &#8220;It&#8217;s important that legislators see what impact their support for not only our campus, but for the University of California as a whole, has on the lives of Californians.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trip focused on celebrating California Community College students' increased access to UC Santa Cruz through the initiative to make transfer students a third of all California undergraduate enrollment, often called 2-1 for short. Students and staff urged legislators to provide increased permanent funding to the campus to support the retention and graduation of transfer students. Students highlighted their experiences as transfer students, a community that includes a large percentage of first generation, underrepresented, re-entry, student parents, veteran, and independent students.</p>
<p>Those on the trip included transfer students Lexi Baczynski and Jessica Parra Moya, student veteran Francisco Mu&#241;oz, re-entry student Heather Willoughby, Sara Radoff, director of Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students (STARS),&#160;<span>Cultivamos Excelencia HSI Project Director&#160;</span>Riana Howard and <span style="font-weight: 400;">STARS&#160;</span>program coordinator&#160;Jannet Ceja, and Erick Ramirez, Cultivamos Excelencia counselor.</p>
<p>The lobbying effort was organized by Government and Community Relations in University Relations. Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students (STARS) professional and student staff, Admissions, and Enrollment Management also participated in the effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was moved by the students stories, which highlighted not only their successes in gaining admission to UC Santa Cruz, but also the real challenges they face in higher education,&#8221; Radoff said. &#8220;The students illustrated how important it is for university leaders to move beyond a conversation of transfer access, and into a new dialogue about how we as a campus will support them toward graduation."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6fe106818072701734bebd3c250c609c"><name>alumni-weekend-2019-feature-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Weekend 2019: Slugs in the mist</title><summary>More than a thousand people, including 560 alumni, converged on the hilly forested campus for Alumni Weekend 2019, complete with thought-provoking lectures, snacks, free Slug Taxis, a fond farewell, and dancing into the night. </summary><start-date>1556655840000</start-date><display-name>alumniweekend2019feature</display-name><path>/2019/04/alumni-weekend-2019-feature-story</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/alumni-weekend-2019-feature-story</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1556655178621</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1556658025366</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/alumniweekendpioneer3501.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/alumniweekendpioneer3501.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alumniweekendpioneer3501.jpg</name><display-name>alumniweekendpioneer350.jpg</display-name><file-size>59908</file-size><width>350</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/alumniweekendslugfun.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/alumniweekendslugfun.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alumniweekendslugfun.jpg</name><display-name>alumniweekendslugfun.jpg</display-name><file-size>23688</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winnie Hoskyns-Abraham (Stevenson &#8217;69, anthropology) regaled a crowd of Pioneer Alumni with stories from the past 50 years at a special reunion celebration held at the recently restored Hay Barn.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a well-known fact that cool weather and fog bring out the banana slugs in droves. That was certainly the case during UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s highly spirited&#8212;and often cloudy&#8212;Alumni Weekend, marked by myriad gatherings and offerings including reunions, lectures, gossip, chit-chat, jewelry-making, dancing, art tours, and &#8220;Slug Taxis&#8217;&#8217; spiriting revelers from one event to the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed fitting that the marine layer was a constant presence during the weekend, considering that the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/10/review-fall-2010-mists.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cool coastal weather was one of the reasons the UC Regents ended up founding a new campus in Santa Cruz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1965 instead of building one in sun-scorched Almaden Valley, as the story goes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was impossible to do every activity, considering there were a whopping 75 events, representing all 10 colleges, and activities that appealed to all tastes, whether you were interested in the potential of life on other planets, or just wanted to hang out at the Porter College Makers Fair, with jewelry-making benches and a tie-dying tank for souvenir T-shirts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a thousand people, including 560 alumni, converged on the hilly forested campus, flagging volunteer-driven &#8220;Slug Taxis&#8221; or boarding shuttles, which made it possible to zip from one remote corner of the campus to another with minimal hassles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a weekend of almost constant anniversaries and reunions. Seymour Marine Discovery Center marked its 40</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> birthday, the Smith Renaissance Society had its 20-year celebration, &#160;and on Friday night at the Hay Barn near the base of campus, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s original graduating class marked its 50</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anniversary with an emotional evening of taking stock and reminiscing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is a blessing to be here,&#8221; said Winnie Hoskyns-Abraham (Stevenson &#8217;69, anthropology), who was known as Winnie Scherrer in her college years. &#8220;We have a lot of classmates who aren&#8217;t.&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also at the pioneer gathering, Laura Caldwell (Cowell &#8217;69 college, literature), a retired school principal in Monterey, reflected on her decision to go to the fledgling UC campus in Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was really drawn to the chance to be in the very first class,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There were no traditions. We were going to make the traditions. We were thrown together and living in these primitive trailers so we got acquainted right away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the same time as the pioneer reception, a group of proud Slugs, some of them decked out in their blue-and-gold regalia, packed Woodstock&#8217;s Pizza in downtown Santa Cruz for the Alumni Weekend kick-off. Beer and stories flowed throughout the night.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mist on the meadow</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday&#8217;s celebration began in grainy fog that burned off in late morning. It was enough to make some revelers feel as if they were traveling through the mists of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;d like to transport ourselves back to school&#8212;a time without responsibilities except for grades,&#8221; said Kate Grant Bateman (Cowell &#8217;98, American studies), who had just finished the 5K Fun Run across campus. She enjoyed the run, though she and several others got lost at one point. &#8220;At Kresge College, you&#8217;re supposed to make a right but we went straight. We went the long way&#8212;all uphills!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That morning in Quarry Plaza, Gwynn Benner, assistant vice provost for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Division of Student Success, and Christina Yu (College Ten &#8217;20, cognitive science), were at a table in the courtyard, getting the word out about the campus&#8217;s First-Generation Initiative, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">focused on responding to and supporting the fast-growing first-generation college student population on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu, the Chancellor&#8217;s Undergraduate Internship Program intern for the First-Gen Initiative, is a first-generation student who is eager to help others. Born in China, she immigrated with her family to the United States when she was 5, and lived in San Francisco&#8217;s Chinatown. Mindful of her parents&#8217; sacrifices, she put intense pressure on herself to succeed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After teaming up with the First-Gen Initiative, Yu was heartened to find out that many other students had similar experiences. Even one of her academic advisors spoke to her about similar struggles. Now Yu has decided to follow her dream. She is now pursuing a career in education, and is planning to spend her summer teaching English to elementary school students in Taiwan. </span></p>
<p><strong>Improvising and laughing your way through life</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of crowd participation and attendance, a special Cowell Colloquium with a mouthful of a title&#8212;&#8220;Where the Deer and the Antelope and the Banana Slug Roam: Hair Raising Tales from the Rough Terrain of the Western American Public Intellectual,&#8217;&#8217; was one of the surprise hits of Alumni Weekend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A throng of 200 people greeted the distinguished historian Patricia Nelson Limerick </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Cowell '72, American studies), </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founding director of the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">where she is also a professor of environmental studies and history. She is the author of&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desert Passages, The Legacy of Conquest, Something in the Soil,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;and&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Ditch in Time. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limerick</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">talked about the ways that improv theater training helped sustain her wild career. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her frequently hilarious discussion with Cowell Provost Alan Christy, an associate history professor at UC Santa Cruz, she talked about her participation in the Original Banana Slug Improvisational Theater, and how this extracurricular activity ended up coming in handy every time she&#8217;s had to deal with stage fright, difficult personalities, conflicting ideologies, and charged situations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every day of a public intellectual&#8217;s life is thin ice,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You are always stepping carefully. Even then, that won&#8217;t always save you.&#8221; Limerick said improv should be a UC Santa Cruz requirement, preparing students to deal with an ever-changing world. </span></p>
<p><strong>High-impact science in the spotlight</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning Slugs also got an accessible and enjoyable crash course in &#8220;High-Impact Science from PBSci&#8221; from four distinguished faculty members who all happen to be Slugs themselves. These lightning talks&#8212;each presentation lasted only six minutes or so&#8212;were a public forum to highlight the power of research. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is a place where we try to make sure that science doesn&#8217;t just stay in the academy,&#8221; said Physical &amp; Biological Sciences Dean Paul Koch, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences. &#8220;We want our work to have impact in the real world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The topics and speakers were:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life and the Environment&#8212;Kristy Kroeker (Crown &#8216;01, marine biology)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next-Generation Medicine&#8212;Olena Morozova Vaske (biomolecular engineering postdoc 2013&#8211;2016)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earth and the Cosmos&#8212;Natalie Batalha ( Ph.D. &#8217;97, astrophysics)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching Techniques for Today&#8212;Aura Alegra Eroy&#8209;Reveles &#160;Ph.D. &#8217;08, chemistry)</span></li>
</ul>
<span>Another highlight was an eye-opening talk about &#8220;Radical Learning&#8212;The Heart of the UC Santa Cruz Experience.&#8221; </span><a href="https://literature.ucsc.edu/faculty/singleton.php?&amp;singleton=true&amp;cruz_id=jgreene"><span>Jody Greene</span></a><span>, professor of literature, feminist studies, and history of consciousness, and director of the Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (CITL), led a team of faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates about ways to improve conditions in which students can learn.</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene introduced an array of speakers&#8212;including faculty as well as a group of eloquent and enthusiastic student interns with CITL&#8212;who addressed the importance of understanding student strengths for learning and how faculty and staff can better support students including first-gen learners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We think what is going on at UC Santa Cruz is a renaissance,&#8221; said U</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">C Santa Cruz Foundation Distinguished Professor of Psychology </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbara Rogoff, who is a CITL senior faculty fellow. &#8220;We are a model for making higher education much more accessible for learners.&#8221; &#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A weekend with engineering Slugs</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baskin School of Engineering had a full schedule of events throughout Alumni Weekend. Festivities began on Friday afternoon in Silicon Valley with a night of gaming and glimpses at the increasingly blurred edge between games and reality. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday&#8217;s events included a selection of teach-ins in intimate classroom settings. Slugs nestled in to learn about &#8220;Responsible Data Science&#8221; from this year&#8217;s faculty lecturer Lise Getoor, professor of computer science and engineering. Abhradeep Guha Thakurta, assistant professor of computer science and engineering, gave a provocative lecture titled &#8220;Decoding Genetic Privacy.&#8221; Meanwhile, Slugs curious about energy and biofuel were treated to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Fuel, Food, and Pharma: Can Synthetic Biology Empower Social Change?" </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Bernick, assistant adjunct professor of biomolecular engineering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slugs also got behind-the-scenes laboratory tours with pennant-waving Baskin Engineering student ambassadors. The Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells, featuring Camilla Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering; the Hybrid Systems Lab, featuring Ricardo Sanfelice, professor of electrical and computer engineering, and The CAVE, featuring Sri Kurniawan, professor of computational media, and Mircea Teodorescu, associate professor of electrical and &#160;computer engineering, all opened their doors and explained their research.</span></p>
<p><strong>An intoxicating discussion </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another one of the weekend&#8217;s surprise hits was history professor Ben Breen&#8217;s surprising, funny, irreverent, and sometimes gasp-inducing talk called &#8220;Summoning Spirits,&#8221; an exploration of the strange and mutable life of distilled liquor from the 15</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the 18</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> centuries, and its changing identities, from miracle elixir to alleged social scourge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Powerful liquors were prescribed by doctors in the Middle Ages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People drank it on their death beds, hoping for a last-ditch cure,&#8221; he noted. Breen showed the remarkable attitudinal shifts towards distilled alcoholic beverages, from a substance that could purge or &#8220;distill&#8217;&#8217; foolish behaviors, to a destructive and demonic force. One slide, dating to 1829, showed a &#8220;Gin Juggarnath&#8221; on wheels, crushing everyone in its path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of those frightening images, several people at the talk said that Breen&#8217;s presentation somehow made them look forward even more to the annual Beer and Wine Reception, which immediately followed his lecture.</span></p>
<p><strong>Bidding farewell to a chancellor </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual Beer and Wine Reception, held in a redwood-lined space between Quarry Plaza and the Quarry Amphitheater, had special resonance this year. It was the last reception that Chancellor George Blumenthal will attend as the Top Slug on campus. Alumni Council President Michael Riepe (Oakes &#8217;91, computer engineering) raised a toast to Blumenthal, and praised him as a caring and accomplished listener. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is a tremendous attribute I will try to learn from,&#8221; Riepe said. &#8220;I appreciate his honesty and accessibility.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blumenthal struck a note of humility at the reception. He gave special thanks to his assistant Margaret McGuire. He said he&#8217;s &#8220;not particularly comfortable&#8217;&#8217; with the accolades he has been receiving in light of his retirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s important is what we have done together,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not me. I think it&#8217;s very much a &#8216;we&#8217; thing. We&#8217;ve always been in this together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some, the reception and the send-off to the chancellor was a fitting conclusion to a jam-packed day. But for others, the reception was just a jumping off point to one last Alumni Weekend bash: a dance party hosted by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Research Center for the Americas at the Museum of Art and&#160;History featuring the sounds of the local band Cal&#237;co, known for its Latin-fusion beats. Others opted to remain on campus for a rare reunion concert from a popular campus band, the Flowers of Evil. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, dancing with friends was a fitting way to round out another successful Alumni Weekend celebration. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7074b9f48072701734bebd3c941534cf"><name>acting-dean-grad-studies</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Quentin Williams to serve as acting graduate studies dean</title><summary>I am delighted to announce that Quentin Williams, associate vice chancellor for research, has agreed to serve as UC Santa Cruz's acting vice provost and dean of graduate studies, effective June 1.</summary><start-date>1556607600000</start-date><display-name>Quentin Williams to serve as acting graduate studies dean</display-name><path>/2019/04/acting-dean-grad-studies</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/acting-dean-grad-studies</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1556664858320</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1556664858320</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I am delighted to announce that Quentin Williams, associate vice chancellor for research, has agreed to serve as UC Santa Cruz's acting vice provost and dean of graduate studies, effective June 1.</p>

at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium on Wednesday (May 1, 2019).</p>
<p>The event was part of College Signing Day, a national celebration spearheaded by former First Lady Michelle Obama, whose address from UCLA was live-streamed to more than 3,000 venues across the country.</p>
<p>Reach Higher, Obama's college access and success initiative, focuses on inspiring high school seniors and community college transfer students&#8212;especially first-generation and low-income students&#8212;to achieve their educational and career goals.</p>
<p>"Like me, you were told you weren't college material," Obama told an energized crowd in Pauley Pavilion at UCLA. "You were setting your sights too high. They told me I wanted too much&#8212;I should dream a little smaller."</p>
<p>A Princeton graduate, Obama encouraged her national audience of 600,000 students to brace for more negativity, but to never let the "haters" get the best of them.</p>
<p>"Ask yourself whether you are going to believe the haters, or whether you're going to believe the honest truth of your own story," she said. "That's what you've done to be here today. You've told all those doubters they'd better make room!"</p>
<p>Obama's remarks were met with enthusiasm in Santa Cruz. Students from 16 regional high schools were invited to attend the event, which was a collaborative effort put on by UCSC's Educational Partnership Center (EPC), Office of Admissions, and Division of University Relations. Students accepted to UCSC from 13 regional community colleges were also invited, said EPC Executive Director Maria Rocha-Ruiz.</p>
<p>Keynote speaker Alegra Eroy-Reveles, an assistant teaching professor of chemistry and biochemistry, described her own path from Watsonville High School to UC Santa Cruz and a doctorate in chemistry. She offered tips for success, including "ask for what you need," "do what you love," and "always do your best."</p>
<p>"There are people on campus who want to help you," she said. "They want you to be successful."</p>
<p>As part of the program, students were invited to introduce themselves, declare where they will enroll in the fall, and mention their career goal. Dozens of students joyfully proclaimed their intention to enroll at schools from Cabrillo College to Cornell University, and their pursuit of careers in science, law, education, social work, medicine, technology, and business.</p>
<p>Nelson Ramirez plans to study computer science and gaming at UC Santa Cruz, but the Harbor High School senior said he's leaving open his options to add psychology, writing, and journalism. Fellow Harbor High student Cristina Vargas plans to major in biology at UCSC, aiming toward a career in veterinary medicine. "I'll be living at home, so I'm going to join the cheer team and Latinx organizations to make friends," she said. "My family is here, and I enjoy this area. And I like my financial aid package."</p>
<p>Megan Harp, who plans to major in film and digital media at UCSC, will enroll as a junior transfer after completing two years at Gavilan College in Gilroy. She attended the event with her mother&#8212;and was happy to win a microwave oven during the raffle. Reach Higher, Obama's organization, provided mini grants that funded raffle prizes, including six laptop computers, a microwave oven, bedsheets, and two autographed copies of Obama's bestselling memoir, <em>Becoming</em>.</p>
<p>Obama wore a cropped Compton College t-shirt, black jeans, and sneakers at the UCLA event, saying, "I wanted to give our community colleges a little extra love. We are fortunate in this country to have an amazing community college system."</p>
<p>Obama's inclusive message honored the choices made by those choosing trade school, the military, community college, or a four-year university. "It's the best investment you can possibly make, she said.</p>
<p>She admonished the crowd to ask for help--for tutors and counselors--and "make those professors teach you!" "You have to build a community for yourself," she said. "You guys have to have a posse of support."</p>
<p>"If you stumble&#8230; I want you to get back up," said Obama. "It's not the failure, it's the ability to bounce back from the failure. That's what makes you a true champion."</p>

Her last day on campus will be June 30.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I am extremely happy for Marlene. The Boise State position is a wonderful opportunity. It is a university on the rise, and Marlene will have the opportunity to define its path. But Boise's gain is very much our loss. Marlene in her two years at UC Santa Cruz has done transformative work, helping shape our future through her tireless efforts leading creation of our Strategic Academic Plan. She ensured that the strengths of our campus &#8212; collaborative, interdisciplinary work &#8212; are its foundation. Once implemented, it will have far-reaching impacts, fostering new partnerships, boosting our reputation as a pre-eminent research university, and expanding our resources. Among her many other accomplishments, Marlene created an EVC Fellows program to advance faculty research, developed a Staff Fellows program to encourage professional development, and launched an administrative leadership program that will allow faculty to work on administrative projects in the offices of key leaders.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Marlene embraces the values our campus holds dear: a deep commitment to social justice, the pursuit of excellence, the value of diversity in all its forms, and the abiding belief that the status quo is not good enough. I have personally valued her counsel and collaboration. I wish Marlene the best of luck moving forward. She has served our campus exceptionally well.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">I am delighted to announce that Lori Kletzer, our graduate studies dean, has accepted my offer to take the reins as interim campus provost and executive vice chancellor. Lori has deep roots on campus, arriving in 1992 as an assistant professor of economics. She served as economics department chair, then vice chair and chair of the Santa Cruz division of the Academic Senate. In 2010 she become provost and dean of faculty at Colby College. She returned to UCSC as graduate studies dean last year, and served as interim arts dean for a short period, earning rave reviews. She brings to the CPEVC role great experience as a provost, a high level of intellectual prowess, and a track record of collaboration. She will be a great resource for the incoming chancellor, and I am delighted to have her on board.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d3971f278072704664be42b4877b51ca"><name>full-rss-feed</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>RSS Feed</title><start-date>1646208000000</start-date><display-name>RSS Feed</display-name><path>/2019/04/full-rss-feed</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/full-rss-feed</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1648522370845</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648522370845</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name><value>http://news.ucsc.edu</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name><value>20</value></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="bd9cbe40807270172739340f33aad174"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2019/04/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/04/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1545074425394</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1545074425394</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
