Le Guin is debuting tonight on PBS.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a landmark moment for filmmaker Arwen Curry (Kresge &#8217;96, language studies) whose movie, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes revelatory interviews with the author, who died last year at age 88.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The movie has been making the rounds of film festivals and universities, but tonight will be its broadcast premiere.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curry spent more than 10 years on the film project, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which includes footage of Le Guin and interviews with such literary luminaries as David Mitchell, Neil Gaiman, and Margaret Atwood. The movie also brings some of Le Guin&#8217;s most beloved creations, including the world of Earthsea, to vivid life with painstakingly crafted illustrations and animated sequences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film shows the path that Le Guin forged to make a name for herself in the sci-fi world at a time when that literary genre was male-dominated. She also helped to break down the boundaries of literary fiction and genre fiction&#8212;showing that fine writing and a love of language had a place in sci-fi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those barriers were quite strong when she began writing,&#8221; Curry said. &#8220;The excellence of her work made people turn their heads and say, &#8216;Literature is happening here. This is serious work.&#8217; Younger writers like Mitchell and Gaiman read her work and understood that they didn&#8217;t have to sacrifice literary quality to bring in fantastical elements they wanted to include in their work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curry started filming Le Guin in 2008 and filmed on and off into 2016. Sometimes there were long gaps between recorded interview sessions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She was extremely busy, and because of her age, I would plan carefully,&#8221; said Curry. &#8220;We would set it up a couple of months in advance. I wanted to film her in the different physical places that meant so much to her, so we planned a lot of production up on the Oregon Coast and in the Napa Valley. That was part of how we structured production.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;premieres tonight (Friday, August 2 at 9 p.m.) on PBS and will also be available for streaming at&#160;</span><a href="http://pbs.org/americanmasters"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBS.org/americanmasters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;and on the PBS Video app, which is available for iOS, Android, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and Samsung Smart TVs. Once the app is installed, visit&#160;</span><a href="http://pbs.org/activate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pbs.org/activate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, input your activation code

<p>Presented in collaboration with The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz, <em>Community Night</em> offers an opportunity for both longtime festival goers and first-timers alike to get a more intimate perspective on the talented artists who come from around the world to be a part of the Cabrillo Festival orchestra.</p>
<p>Cabrillo Festival Music Director Cristi Macelaru and members of the Festival Orchestra have put together a concert that will feature new and recent chamber works that showcase festival musicians as soloists and in small ensembles.</p>
<p>Executive Director of the Festival, Ellen Primack, noted that this year&#8217;s <em>Community Night</em> is particularly exciting for the staff, orchestra, and community, as it features world premieres written and performed by two of the Festival&#8217;s orchestra members. She added that both the Cabrillo Festival and The Humanities Institute are offering a limited number of free tickets to the Santa Cruz community to ensure everyone will have a chance to experience the Festival orchestra.</p>
<p>Primack observed that <em>Community Night</em> is unique in the way it brings together the Festival&#8217;s strengths and its core values.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cabrillo Festival stands on two pillars of strength--our artistic soul that lies with the incredible orchestra musicians who come from across the globe, and the culture of the organization that is born of this special community. When we can create an opportunity for our musicians to shine as individual artists--a bit more akin to rock stars--and at the same time open our doors more broadly to community members--with a pay-what-you-can sliding scale, as well as our free ticket offer--we&#8217;ve married the best of our strengths and our values.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Community Night is also a reflection</strong> of the Festival&#8217;s ongoing partnership with The Humanities Institute (THI) at UC Santa Cruz. This has lead to collaborative programming and festival events, such as the Ruth Bader Ginsburg tribute&#160;<strong><em><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/05/aptheker-justice-ginsburg.html">&#8220;My Own Words: The Law and Legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#8221;</a></em></strong>&#160;held in downtown Santa Cruz earlier this year.</p>
<p>The THI-Cabrillo Festival collaboration additionally provides opportunities for public humanities research and work experience through the THI's <strong><em><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/12/humanities-public-fellows.html">Public Fellowship Program</a></em></strong>. This summer Sienna Ballou, a graduate student in the Literature Department at UC Santa Cruz, is working with festival organizers on the logistics of the two-week long contemporary music festival as a public fellow. She has begun chronicling her experience through a blog on the Cabrillo Festival website. Her first post,&#160;<strong><em><a href="http://cabrillomusic.org/the-festival-through-my-eyes-introduction/">&#8220;The Festival Through My Eyes,&#8221;&#160;</a></em></strong>describes the festival offices and her work as a production assistant. An interview with Ballou can also be found on the <strong><em><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/sienna-ballou-summer-public-fellow-with-the-cabrillo-festival/">THI website</a></em></strong>,&#160;where she talks in detail about her experience as a public fellow.</p>
<p>The ongoing collaboration between the two organizations has proved to be beneficial to both partners, as well as the local community.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the Humanities Institute, we believe that art and the humanities are not a luxury, but a necessity,&#8221; noted THI managing director Irena Polic. &#8220;That is why we are committed to engaging with the broadest community possible--from first-generation students and scholars in every discipline, to local residents, and anyone interested in making sense of our complex world. &#160;We are thrilled to be partnering yet again with Cabrillo Festival, an amazing organization at the heart of our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>In turn, the collaboration has helped introduce new audiences to the Cabrillo Festival, and provided an opportunity for the festival to share its unique music and programming with the university.</p>
<p>As Primack noted, &#8220;This partnership has been extraordinary in building connections between the community and the university and sharing our respective commitment to the arts and humanities.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the university&#8217;s commitment to being transparent and publicly accountable, including on the way it compensates its faculty and staff, UC is conducting its annual disclosure of systemwide employee compensation for calendar year 2018. This disclosure parallels last year&#8217;s payroll disclosure and is consistent with similar practices at many other public institutions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The 2018 payroll data, along with a summary analysis, is&#160;<a href="https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/content-analysis/employees/compensation-reporting.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available online here</a>. The data will also be available to news media.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Because UC is a public institution, employee compensation is considered a public record under the California Public Records Act and is reflected in the staff personnel policy in Personnel Policies for Staff Members&#160;<a href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4010419/PPSM-80" rel="noopener" target="_blank">(PPSM 80(C):</a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Information which is public information and which should be released upon request includes name, date of hire, current position title, current salary, organizational unit assignment, date of separation, office address and office telephone number, current job description, full-time or part-time, and appointment type.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Academic personnel policy,&#160;<a href="https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/apm/apm-160.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Academic Personnel Manual (APM) 160-20(b)(4)</a><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/apm/apm-160.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1565117144945000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHmmgUJ0rO8Qa6LPghcPFq-mG6ttw" href="https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/apm/apm-160.pdf"></a>,&#160;also states that any &#8220;non-personal&#8221; information &#8220;is public information and is available upon request to any person or entity without limitation.&#8221; It defines &#8220;non-personal&#8221; academic personnel information as including name, date of hire or separation, current position title, and current rate of pay.</p>

<p>A member of the Music Department faculty since 1998, and an affiliate of Digital Arts and New Media, Paul was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in 2009 and lived with the disease, assisted by his partner and husband Robert, for 10 years. Paul assumed medical emeritus status in 2011, but continued teaching, and was active in the development of human-computer interface software for users with disabilities, until 2014. He continued composing actively until the end, using computer hardware that tracked his eye movements, and software that he helped develop.</p>
<p>After growing up in Columbia, Missouri, Paul earned bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Rochester and in music theory from the Eastman School of Music, and a Ph.D. in music theory from Columbia University. Paul was a beloved teacher, and a rare two-time awardee of UCSC&#8217;s distinguished Excellence in Teaching Award. His scholarly work was diverse and impactful, ranging from the perception of rhythmic complexity to harmonic structure, and his computational approaches to the organization of arbitrary time sequences have had a major impact on machine listening technology. A CD of his compositions,&#160;<em>A Distant Music</em>, was released by New World Records in 2015; the disc&#8217;s liner notes, by Professor Amy Beal, illuminate his approach to composing and the ways it changed in the context of his illness.</p>
<p>Paul is survived by his husband, Robert, and his brother, Jon, and his ashes will be scattered in a private ceremony in Monterey Bay. A memorial, date and time to be determined, will be held by the Music Department at UCSC. Memorial donations in Paul Nauert's name may be sent to the ALS Association Golden West Chapter, PO Box 565, Agoura Hills, CA 91376.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Department of Music</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6405c8ac8072701734bebd3cf38f6861"><name>campus-lane-closures</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Lane Closures </title><summary>As summer improvements continue, the campus will be implementing lane closures this week in the following areas: Crown Circle, Kerr Road, and College Nine. </summary><start-date>1564988400000</start-date><display-name>Campus Lane Closures </display-name><path>/2019/08/campus-lane-closures</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/08/campus-lane-closures</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1565046195568</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1565046591474</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>As summer improvements continue, the campus will be implementing lane closures this week in the following areas:</span></p>

research</article-subhead><article-text><p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">From its origins more than 300 years ago in Newton&#8217;s work on planetary orbits, the three-body problem has blossomed into a rich subject that continues to yield new insights for mathematicians. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Richard Montgomery, a distinguished professor of mathematics at UC Santa Cruz, calls it one of the classic quandaries in mathematical history. In an article in the August issue of </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Scientific American</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, he recounts the history of the three-body problem and the progress that he and other mathematicians have made in the past two decades. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It has challenged people for centuries, and that&#8217;s partly what makes it interesting. You&#8217;re adding to the work of people like Newton and Poincar&#233; and Lagrange,&#8221; Montgomery said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The fundamental problem is to predict the motions of three bodies (such as stars or planets) mutually attracted by gravity, given their initial positions and velocities. It turns out that a general solution to the problem is essentially impossible due to chaotic dynamics, which Henri Poincar&#233; discovered in 1890. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">There are solutions for special cases, but there&#8217;s not a simple formula to give you a general solution,&#8221; Montgomery explained.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">From the practical standpoint of predicting planetary orbits and planning space missions, approximations can be calculated with a high degree of accuracy using computers and a process called numerical integration. That may be good enough for NASA, but not for mathematicians, whose continued explorations of the problem have led to important advances in mathematics.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Falling cats</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The three-body problem ties together three different branches of mathematics: topology, geometry, and dynamics. Montgomery said that was what got him interested in it more than 20 years ago. He had been working on questions related to the mathematics and physics of how a cat lands on its feet, which has applications in control theory and satellite orientation.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">I kept simplifying the problem until the cat consisted of just three point masses,&#8221; Montgomery said. Then a colleague referred him to another mathematician who had been working on similar ideas, and before long he had switched from falling cats to celestial mechanics. Hearing that the best people working on celestial mechanics were in Paris, Montgomery spent a sabbatical there working with Alain Chenciner at Paris Diderot University on the three-body problem. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">One of their first major results, published in 2000, was a rediscovery and proof of a figure-eight-shaped solution, in which three bodies of equal mass chase one another endlessly around a figure-eight loop. Although Chris Moore of the Santa Fe Institute had first found this solution in 1993, using a numerical approximation method, its rediscovery by Montgomery and Chenciner had a much bigger impact on the field. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">We were able to give a rigorous existence proof of the figure-eight solution, and the way we did it allowed others to generalize the solution and find a lot of other interesting things,&#8221; Montgomery explained. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">A more general statement of the three-body problem for any number of bodies greater than two is called the N-body problem. Montgomery said when he first presented the three-body figure-eight solution at a conference, a member of the audience quickly pointed out how it should work for four bodies. Soon, mathematicians were discovering a diverse array of new orbits for the equal-mass N-body problem. These periodic solutions in which all of the masses chase each other around a fixed, closed curve without collisions were named &#8220;choreographies&#8221; by Spanish mathematician Carles Sim&#243;, who has discovered hundreds of them. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It created a mini-industry, so that we now know vast numbers of these choreographies,&#8221; Montgomery said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">New direction</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Years later, Sim&#243; helped send Montgomery&#8217;s research on the three-body problem in a new direction by suggesting he look for dynamical mechanisms underlying the periodic solutions. This led to a productive collaboration in recent years with Rick Moeckel of the University of Minnesota. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The new mathematical ideas that have emerged from Montgomery&#8217;s work on the three-body problem do not have practical applications, at least not yet. It is often the case that abstract mathematical concepts are developed long before anyone finds a practical use for them. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Many people have been captivated by the aesthetic appeal of the figure-eight solution and other choreographies. The concept has even made its way into science fiction through Chinese author Liu Cixin, whose novel </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>The Three-Body Problem</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> won the Hugo Award in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">But Montgomery says he would never have tackled the problem if he had not had tenure.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It&#8217;s such a hard problem, and you don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re going to make any progress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But persistence pays off sometimes. So I appreciate the tenure system, and also being able to take sabbaticals to work with collaborators. There&#8217;s something about physically meeting people that is so important for working together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In his </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Scientific American</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> article, Montgomery provides not only a detailed description of the three-body problem, but also a fascinating story of the international collaborations and personal relationships that enabled him to make progress on this compelling mathematical conundrum.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="690ed1228072701734bebd3cc80332a5"><name>message-campus-safety</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Working together for campus safety</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is saddened by the spate of mass shootings weâ€™re seeing nationwide.

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The A&#241;o Nuevo Island animal count project (</span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="http://sealcount.com/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">sealcount.com</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">) launched on Wednesday, August 7, on the </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Zooniverse</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> citizen science platform. Volunteers are needed to help identify and count the animals in a vast trove of aerial photographs of the island and its inhabitants. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Access to the island is limited to a small number of researchers each year, so we see this as an exciting opportunity to share the magic of A&#241;o Nuevo Island with the public,&#8221; said UCSC biologist Roxanne Beltran. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">A&#241;o Nuevo Island, part of the UC Natural Reserve System&#8217;s </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://anonuevoreserve.ucsc.edu/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, is an important breeding site for northern elephant seals, California sea lions, and other marine mammals, and for seabirds such as cormorants and gulls. Long-running research projects at the island and nearby sites on the mainland include elephant seal studies led by Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB) and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences. Beltran, a postdoctoral fellow in Costa&#8217;s lab, said annual census counts for individual species on the island have always been a challenge.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The traditional method is to use a hand-held clicker, and you can imagine looking at a beach packed with moving sea lions, with birds attacking your head, and trying to get an accurate count. It&#8217;s hard,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">NOAA conducts manned-aircraft surveys of the seals and sea lions once per year (if conditions allow), and Oikonos, a non-profit conservation organization, does seabird censuses. Improving the accuracy and frequency of surveys is key to tackling time-sensitive research questions, Beltran said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Drone images</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In 2016, reserve director Patrick Robinson obtained research permits to start flying a drone over the island, taking aerial photographs of the entire island every couple of weeks throughout the year for four years. The result is a huge database of about 50,000 photos with the potential to yield valuable information about how the animal populations on the island fluctuate over time. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">UCSC undergraduate Sarah Wood has taken charge of the Zooniverse project as part of her full-time summer internship with Costa&#8217;s lab through the </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="http://camino.ucsc.edu/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">CAMINO</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> program. Wood&#8217;s tasks included creating the project&#8217;s Zooniverse web site, as well as processing all the images and preparing them for the Zooniverse platform. This involved stitching together all the overlapping drone photos taken on a particular day into one seamless image of the entire island. Then each complete image of the island had to be broken down into manageable sections for the volunteers&#8217; animal counts.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">We are hoping to find enough volunteers to count each animal in more than 50 sets of drone photos,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;In an image from just one day of this year, Sarah counted over 18,000 animals, including more than 4,000 California sea lions and 12,000 cormorants.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Volunteers can choose between birds and marine mammals for their counts, and there are online tutorials to teach them how to identify different species. &#8220;Our goal is to get counts, but we want to educate citizen scientists as well, so Sarah included some great natural history content on the web page,&#8221; Beltran said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The population counts for each species will give researchers important insight into the health of the populations and how they change seasonally and from year to year. In addition, when the volunteers click on an animal in an image, it gives researchers the coordinates for that animal&#8217;s location, so they can study things like how the animals clump together, how the birds space out their nests, and so on. </span></p>

The new patents include novel compounds with potential medical uses, innovations in computer chip architecture, and new methods for genome assembly and analysis of genomic sequencing data. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Thanks to the outstanding efforts of our campus innovators, this represents a new high water mark for the UCSC campus, 27% more than our previous best of 20 patents in a single year,&#8221; said Vice Chancellor for Research Scott Brandt. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Brandt also credit</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">ed</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> this milestone to the Office of Research&#8217;s recent innovation and entrepreneurship initiative, funded by the AB2664 grant from the State of California, and the proactive leadership of the Industry Alliances and Technology Commercialization </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">office</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">led by</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> director of intellectual property management Jeff Jackson and senior intellectual property officer Christopher Reed.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The quality of the innovation </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">at UCSC</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> is reflected in the fact that about half of these issued patents are licensed to companies working to develop them into products. </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">T</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">he majority </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">of those companies</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> are startups based in Santa Cruz,&#8221; </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Jackson said</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">. &#8220;While issued patents are one indication of the health of the IP portfolio, another is the number of new inventions disclosed, </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">and t</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">he last fiscal year also was an all-time high in new inventions disclosed (up 10% over last year.)&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Several faculty members received multiple patents, including Mark Akeson, professor of biomolecular engineering, with five patents relate</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">d</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> to nanopore DNA sequencing, a concept invented and pioneered at UC Santa Cruz for analyzing DNA and other molecules as they pass through a tiny pore called a "nanopore."

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Patents with potential applications in clinical medicine include bacterial inhibitors discovered by Victoria Auerbuch Stone, professor of microbology and environmental toxicology, that could lead to the development of new antibiotics effective against multi-drug resistant bacteria.</span></p>

He was 28.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Hoshijima joined the laboratory of Kristy Kroeker, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, in 2018. He was studying how ocean acidification and warming affect kelp forest species in Alaska, with a particular emphasis on what makes some species more resilient to change than others. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Hoshijima was an accomplished scientific diver who began diving in 2011 and had experience in a wide range of conditions, including diving under the ice for his graduate work in Antarctica. He was also well recognized for his teaching and his generosity with his time, Kroeker said. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">He was an impeccable scientist, and often ran workshops to teach students how to code and do scientific analyses,&#8221; Kroeker said. &#8220;He was beloved by his lab mates and colleagues worldwide.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Hoshijima was also a talented musician who played multiple instruments. He would often sit on one of the benches outside the Coastal Biology Building during breaks from his work and play the accordion. &#8220;He would often do this in the evening as people were leaving work, and I have had many people tell me it was one of the highlights of their day,&#8221; Kroeker said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Hoshijima was broadly interested in the extent to which organisms are adapted to their environment and how that could confer resilience to global change. He started his scientific career as an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz, where he earned a B.S. in biological sciences, with minors in chemistry and electronic music, in 2013. In graduate school at UC Santa Barbara, he studied the effects of ocean acidification on marine species, from the sea urchins inhabiting the kelp forests near Santa Barbara to the tiny, planktonic snails at the base of the Antarctic food web. He earned his Ph.D. in ecology, evolution, and marine biology in 2018. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">An American citizen born to Japanese parents, Hoshijima grew up in Southern California where his father was an adjunct professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine. As a first-generation immigrant, he was passionate about making science inclusive for students of varied backgrounds. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Hoshijima is survived by his father, Dr. Masahiko Hoshijima, his mother Yukiko, and brothers Tsuki and Yumehiko.&#160;A memorial ceremony is planned at UC Santa Barbara on Friday, August 16 (see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/448452016011114">Facebook page</a> for details).</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8bf8e1f98072701734bebd3c9b0cf513"><name>gilliam-fellows</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two UCSC graduate students win HHMI Gilliam Fellowships for Advanced Study</title><summary>The Howard Hughes Medical Institute has awarded Gilliam Fellowships for Advanced Study to two UC Santa Cruz graduate students, Apple Cortez Vollmers and Donna Poscablo.</summary><start-date>1565679600000</start-date><display-name>Two UCSC graduate students win HHMI Gilliam Fellowships for Advanced Study</display-name><path>/2019/08/gilliam-fellows</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/08/gilliam-fellows</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1565716438728</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1565717044570</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/08/images/donna-poscablo-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/08/images/donna-poscablo-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>donna-poscablo-350.jpg</name><display-name>donna-poscablo-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>117324</file-size><width>350</width><height>377</height></image><image-alt>Donna Poscablo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/08/images/donna-poscablo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/08/images/donna-poscablo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>donna-poscablo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>donna-poscablo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>52684</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Donna Poscablo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Donna Poscablo</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/08/images/apple-vollmers-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/08/images/apple-vollmers-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>apple-vollmers-350.jpg</name><display-name>apple-vollmers-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>105155</file-size><width>350</width><height>428</height></image><image-alt>Apple Vollmers</image-alt><image-caption>Apple Vollmers (photo by&#160;Anh Nguyen)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) has awarded <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/science-education/programs/gilliam-fellowships-advanced-study">Gilliam Fellowships for Advanced Study</a> to two UC Santa Cruz graduate students, Apple Cortez Vollmers and Donna Poscablo. The Gilliam Fellowship program recognizes exceptional doctoral students who have the potential to be leaders in their fields and the desire to advance diversity and inclusion in the sciences.</p>
<p>Vollmers, who has also received a fellowship from the Ford Foundation, is working with Susan Carpenter, assistant professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology, to study the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating the inflammatory response of the innate immune system. They have identified a lncRNA called GAPLINC as a novel regulator of the immune response and are investigating its biological functions and molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe our research can have a broad impact, directing future therapies for sepsis and other inflammation-associated diseases,&#8221; Vollmers said.</p>
<p>After studying biology at UC San Diego and working in a research laboratory, Vollmers earned a teaching credential and taught high school mathematics in San Jose for four years before entering the graduate program at UC Santa Cruz. As a teacher at a school with a large population of low-income students, she found that her own background, having grown up in a disadvantaged community after her family immigrated from the Philippines, helped her to identify with and support her students. Vollmers is the first in her family to attend college and pursue a Ph.D. At UCSC, she serves as a mentor for undergraduates and continues to focus on supporting underrepresented students in the sciences.</p>
<p>&#8220;My experience as a classroom teacher fuels my need to continue advocating for underrepresented students,&#8221; Vollmers said, adding that she is excited to serve as a role model for her former students, five of whom are now undergraduates at UCSC, and she hopes to establish a peer-mentor program for graduate students.</p>
<p>Poscablo is studying age-related changes in platelets and their role in age-associated strokes, working with Camilla Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering. They discovered a platelet differentiation pathway activated during aging that results in two distinct populations of platelets in older mice. Poscablo is investigating how this pathway is induced and whether it is related to the abnormalities in platelet regulation that are associated with strokes. She has also received a fellowship from the American Heart Association.</p>
<p>&#8220;My long-term goal is to develop therapeutic and preventative strategies for stroke by directly targeting the key regulators of age-specific platelet formation and function,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Poscablo, whose family moved from the Philippines to Honolulu when she was 8, said education became the primary instrument of change in her life. In high school, her enthusiasm for science led to participation in a research program at the University of Hawaii, where she later enrolled as an undergraduate and became the first in her family to graduate from college. She did summer research projects at UCSF and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and later did research at UCSF for her master&#8217;s degree from San Francisco State University.</p>
<p>While the scientific community has felt like a &#8220;second home&#8221; to her, Poscablo said she was keenly aware of inequalities in the scientific workforce and the importance of an inclusive environment to attract and cultivate the potential of diverse scientific talent. She aims to support diversity and inclusion in graduate programs at UCSC by empowering graduate students&#8217; voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been very fortunate to have mentors along my scientific career to feed me with a simple message&#8212;that I belong and my voice is valued,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My mission is to use all aspects of scientific research as a dynamic mechanism for inclusion and to promote confidence and professional advancement of individuals from diverse cultural and social backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Gilliam Fellowships for Advanced Study program promotes excellence in the life sciences and related fields by supporting Ph.D. students committed to a career in academic research and faculty and training programs dedicated to developing the talents of promising graduate students from underrepresented groups.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8c25712e8072701734bebd3c759c4173"><name>nanopore-optofluidics</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Optofluidic chip with nanopore 'smart gate' developed for single molecule analysis</title><summary>A new chip-based platform developed by UCSC researchers integrates nanopores and optofluidic technology for high-throughput analysis of biomolecules.</summary><keywords>Holger Schmidt</keywords><start-date>1565946000000</start-date><display-name>Optofluidic chip with nanopore 'smart gate' developed for single molecule analysis</display-name><path>/2019/08/nanopore-optofluidics</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/08/nanopore-optofluidics</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1565719358984</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1565965697595</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/holger-schmidt-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/holger-schmidt-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>holger-schmidt-350.jpg</name><display-name>holger-schmidt-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>75496</file-size><width>350</width><height>432</height></image><image-alt>Holger Schmidt</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/holger-schmidt-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/holger-schmidt-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>holger-schmidt-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>holger-schmidt-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14692</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Holger Schmidt</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>Holger Schmidt has been&#160;developing optofluidic chip technology in collaboration with researchers at Brigham Young University, with applications in areas such as biological sensors, virus detection, and chemical analysis.

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In a paper </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11723-7"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">published </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>August 16</span></span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> in </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Nature Communications</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, the researchers reported using the device to control the delivery of individual biomolecules&#8212;including ribosomes, DNA, and proteins&#8212;into a fluid-filled channel on the chip. They also showed that the device can be used to sort different types of molecules, enabling selective analysis of target molecules from a mixture. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The capabilities of the programmable nanopore-optofluidic device point the way toward a novel research tool for high-throughput single-molecule analysis on a chip, said Holger Schmidt, the Kapany Professor of Optoelectronics at UC Santa Cruz and corresponding author of the paper.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"We can bring a single molecule into a fluidic channel where it can then be analyzed using integrated optical waveguides or other techniques," Schmidt said. "The idea is to introduce a particle or molecule, hold it in the channel for analysis, then discard the particle, and easily and rapidly repeat the process to develop robust statistics of many single-molecule experiments." </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The new device builds on previous work by Schmidt's lab and his collaborator Aaron Hawkins&#8217; group at Brigham Young University to develop optofluidic chip technology combining microfluidics (tiny channels for handling liquid samples on a chip) with integrated optics for optical analysis of single molecules. The addition of nanopores allows controlled delivery of molecules into the channel, as well as the opportunity to analyze the electrical signal produced as a molecule passes through the pore. This latest work was led by first author Mahmudur Rahman, a graduate student in Schmidt&#8217;s lab at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Nanopore technology has been successfully used in DNA sequencing applications, and Schmidt and other researchers have been exploring new ways to exploit the information in the signals produced as molecules or particles translocate through a nanopore.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">With the feedback control system (a microcontroller and solid-state relay) in the new device, real-time analysis of the current turns the nanopore into a "smart gate" that can be programmed by the user to deliver molecules into the channel in a predetermined manner. The gate can be closed as soon as a single molecule (or any number set by the user) has passed through, and opened again after a set time. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"The use of nanopores as 'smart gates' is a key step toward a single-molecule analysis system that is user-friendly and can work at high throughput," Schmidt said. "It allows user-programmable control over the number of molecules that are being delivered to a fluidic channel for further analysis or processing, selective gating of different types of single molecules, and the ability to deliver single molecules into a chip at record rates of many hundreds per minute."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Using bacterial (70S) ribosomes, the researchers demonstrated controlled delivery of more than 500 ribosomes per minute. Coauthor Harry Noller, the Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology at UC Santa Cruz, has done pioneering research on the structure and function of ribosomes, the molecular machines that synthesize proteins in all living cells, and has been collaborating with Schmidt's group since 2006. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The researchers also used a mixture of DNA and ribosomes to show the device's capacity to selectively activate the gating function for a target molecule (in this case, DNA). This can enable, for example, fluorescence experiments on a controlled number of target molecules, while unlabeled particles are ignored and discarded. Selective gating could also be used for purification or sorting of different particles downstream from the nanopore, based on the signals as the particles pass through the nanopore, Schmidt said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The programmable system allows flexibility for a wide range of potential applications, he said.</span></p>

<p>Tracing the origins of software back to the step-by-step instructions of how things were created in the workshops of 18th-century artists and artisans, he illustrates how today&#8217;s programming languages are the upshot of past efforts to describe the mechanical arts in the language of the liberal arts.</p>
<p>As a result, Sack views his book as an invitation to artists and humanists to see how their ideas are at the very root of software, as well as an invitation to computer scientists to envision themselves as artists and humanists.</p>
<p><em>The Software Arts</em> is the latest contribution to the emerging field of software studies and part of an MIT Press series about the subject. Software studies tracks how software is integrated into the practices of contemporary culture and society&#8212;both through the scholarship of the humanities and social sciences, and in the software creation and research methods of computer science, the arts, and design.</p>
<p>A media theorist, software designer, and artist, Sack is chair and professor of the Film and Digital Media Department at UC Santa Cruz. His artwork has been exhibited by SFMoMA (San Francisco), the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York), the New Museum of Contemporary Art (New York), the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), and the ZKM (Karlsruhe, Germany).</p>
<p>Sack&#8217;s research has been supported by the Paris Institute for Advanced Study, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Sunlight Foundation, and the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>I recently spoke with Sack about <em>The Software Arts</em>:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What inspired you to write this book?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>Ever since I was an undergraduate computer science major taking art courses, it seemed obvious to me that writing software is an art.&#160;My time in graduate school at the MIT Media Lab confirmed this intuition as did reading some of the most famous computer scientists like Donald Knuth and Steve Jobs, who always said, at practically every product launch, that Apple's competitive advantage was the combination of technology and the liberal arts.&#160; But when I started teaching students in the Arts Division how to program, I found this connection between software and the arts difficult to explain.&#160; I embarked on writing the book to discover whether or not this connection was real and, if so, to find a way to more clearly articulate the connection.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> <strong>Why is it important to look at software development from this point of view? What happens if we don&#8217;t?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>For the most part, software design is considered to be either a kind of engineering--as in software engineering--or a form of science--aka computer science.&#160;But, if Steve Jobs was right, it also becomes possible to imagine how computing research and development can be pursued as forms of arts research and humanities scholarship.&#160; With this insight, the path to the next &#8220;insanely great&#8221; computer technology widens to become a great expressway accommodating a much larger and more diverse group of fellow travelers.&#160;</p>
<p>One big issue is a lack of diversity, a problem that science and engineering suffers more than the arts and the humanities.&#160; For instance, I received an undergraduate degree in computer science in the mid-1980s when, nationwide, over one third of the other graduates were women.&#160; But, in the most recent figures we find that women make up only about one seventh of the undergraduate computer science majors.&#160; In the tech industry, the picture appears to be equally bleak.&#160; Software engineer Tracy Chou and others have crowdsourced up-to-the-minute diversity statistics at many companies in Silicon Valley. In their survey of 20,000 software engineers only about 20 percent (about four thousand) are women.&#160; If we can imagine software development to be science and engineering, why can't we also conceive of it as an art or a set of arts, the software arts?&#160; And, if we do, perhaps we can change education, industry, and government so that a more diverse group of people are involved in making the decisions about how our lives are being shaped by software.&#160;</p>
<p>The other big issue is the limiting conceptual framework of computer science that can be improved upon if we look at software development with the intellectual tools of the arts and the humanities.&#160;&#160;The book shows how software was born of an effort to forge language sufficient to describe to those with a liberal arts education the processes, operations, gestures, and machines employed in the workshops of artists, artisans and designers of the mechanical arts.&#160; These &#8220;recipes&#8221; of step-by-step procedures for how to make things were translated into the algorithms of computer science.&#160; But computer science has hobbled itself because the algorithm--its central conceptual construct around which much of computer science education, research, and industry is based--does not apply to the design or analysis of most of the software that we use.&#160;</p>
<p>According to the computer science definition, algorithms are processes that have discrete inputs, that run for a finite number of steps without interacting with anyone or anything, terminate, and then output a discrete number of results.&#160; Computer science (especially key figures in the 1960s, like Donald Knuth) developed this very limiting notion of algorithms basically because they wanted to make the field a form of mathematics and so algorithms were designed to match what we know in mathematics as functions, like the y = f(x) expression we all learn in high school algebra.&#160; But software is so much more complicated than functions.</p>
<p>The algorithms of computer science are not adequate for understanding interactive systems like games, web servers, social media, texting, email: basically anything with an interface.&#160;This shortcoming is struggled with in those areas of computer science and software engineering that are concerned with interactive and distributed systems, but because computer science has hewed so closely to trying to understand the world in terms of mathematical functions (aka their view of algorithms), emerging areas, like human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), agent-based modeling, and game design have all had to borrow or invent their theories and methods from outside the confines of computer science.&#160; Thus we find, for instance, that a lot of the prominent researchers in HCI are psychologists or anthropologists.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What kind of book is this? How would you describe it? Who is the target audience</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The book is a contribution to an emerging field called software studies and the latest addition to the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/series/software-studies">MIT Press series</a> of that name. There are several of us on campus who have contributed to the book series and/or the one existing journal of software studies, <em>Computational Culture</em>, including, from the Computational Media Department, Michael Mateas and Noah Wardrip-Fruin.&#160;Beyond the still-small group of colleagues who are software studies specialists, I wrote the book with two readerships in mind. One is a set of cultural&#160;workers, artists, and scholars of culture interested in examining what software might&#160;have to offer in terms of theories, methods, or tools. The other is a group of computer&#160;scientists and software engineers whose work is bound up with cultural production&#8212;game&#160;design, social media, or streaming video.</p>
<p>My message to all readers is that culture&#160;and computing are knotted together, and one way we can understand their entanglements is by closely reading the texts of software&#8212;code and technical books and papers.&#160;It's an academic book because I wanted to get the history and philosophy right and produce a rigorous argument that connects software and the arts.&#160; But, I wanted it to be a book accessible to a wider audience than just academics so, after I got the final set of peer reviews from MIT Press, I rewrote many parts of the book in dialogue with the Santa Cruz-based developmental editor Kathryn Chetkovich.&#160; So I trust that what I rewrote, after she critiqued my prose to make it approachable by non-academics, can be followed by anyone with an interest in the topics of the book-- like popular science books often make technical things understandable to a wider audience.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What actions do you hope people in general might take in response to this book? &#160;People on campus?&#160; Can you give some specific examples?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>The stakes of this book are threefold: pedagogical, industrial, and epistemological/ethical. First, if software is an art, then education needs to change to integrate it into the liberal arts. What do we teach? What do we learn? These are old questions that need to be posed once again in a world where basic literacy is not just a matter of English, Latin, and Greek, but also of software.</p>
<p>Second, if software can be written in the manner of an artist/humanist, then new avenues of software production beyond engineering and mathematics may be possible&#8212;avenues that some, like Steve Jobs, have already traveled.&#160;</p>
<p>Third, if software is the new lingua franca, then there are a series of ethical and moral questions that must be pursued in conjunction with this epistemological transformation. What counts as knowledge, for whom, and at what cost?&#160; In this country and many others, there is a rising awareness that a wider and more diverse set of people need to learn how to code.&#160; We see this in national efforts to integrate coding into the curriculum of primary schools (like in France) and in organizations like <a href="http://code.org/">code.org</a>.&#160; This form of digital literacy is a good first step and one my Ph.D. students, Fabiola Hanna, and I have been working with Provost Alan Christy to integrate digital literacy into the Cowell College core curriculum at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</p>
<p>I would like to see multiple efforts on campus to support digital literacy.&#160;My book is about the step after that, after just the basics of coding, after digital literacy.&#160; Maybe one could call the next step digital fluency, an effort to rethink the fundamentals of the software that is woven into our everyday lives and our academic theories and methods.&#160; For example, social media has had a bad influence on national elections in many countries and the U.S. Congress is considering measures to regulate it, but could we have university courses in, for example, political theory that explore how software platforms, like Facebook, should be redesigned?&#160; I have done experiments like this in some of my previous research, but it is also a research direction that I hope others in the arts, the humanities, and the social sciences might pursue.&#160;</p>
<p>Beyond the university in, for example, Silicon Valley, software designers need to become fluent in social, political, and cultural theories and methods so that when they work on an influential technology or platform, like Facebook, they can think through the implications of their designs.&#160; Did Facebook intend to facilitate Russian interference in the 2016 US elections?&#160; I doubt it.&#160; Instead, I assume that the Facebook software designers were simply ignorant of the last century of academic work in media studies that exposes the workings of political propaganda, starting with, for instance, Harold Lasswell's research on German propaganda during the two world wars.</p>

But scientists at UC Santa Cruz and the National Marine Fisheries Service have found a way to minimize this apparent conflict through a water management strategy that benefits both species, while also meeting the needs of agricultural water users downstream.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Releases of cold water during the spring and summer create favorable spawning conditions in the Sacramento River for the endangered winter-run chinook salmon, which were cut off from their historical spawning grounds at higher elevations by the construction of Shasta Dam. Salmon eggs require cold water temperatures to survive, but juvenile green sturgeon need the lower flows and warmer temperatures typical of the main stem of the Sacramento River to grow and thrive. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The researchers used statistical modeling to see if there is an optimal management scenario that can meet the needs of both species along with those of downstream water users. Their results, </span><a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13478"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">published </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>August 20</span></span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> in the </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Journal of Applied Ecology</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, show that dam releases can be managed to achieve all three objectives in all but the most severe drought years. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It&#8217;s a win-win-win here in the sense that we&#8217;re not giving up anything to get an improvement for the green sturgeon,&#8221; said Eric Palkovacs, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and senior author of the paper. &#8220;Currently, the primary management objectives are keeping it cold for the salmon eggs and delivering enough water downstream. As a result, we&#8217;ve been refrigerating the river in regions where historically the green sturgeon have been spawning.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">First author Liam Zarri conducted the study for his UCSC master&#8217;s thesis, working with Palkovacs and coauthors Eric Danner and Miles Daniels at the National Marine Fisheries Service laboratory in Santa Cruz. Zarri found that discharge rates and water temperatures strongly influence the body condition of larval green sturgeon. In years with high discharges of cold water, egg survival for winter-run chinook salmon was high but the condition of juvenile green sturgeon was poor. In drought years, however, with low flows and warmer water, green sturgeon did well while salmon egg survival was low. The sturgeon larvae seem to be especially sensitive to high discharges, which affect their swimming ability and availability of prey.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The key to meeting the needs of both species, Zarri said, is that they spawn at slightly different times of the year. &#8220;We&#8217;re able to suggest a management scenario which uses the differential timing of spawning in these two species. When they overlap, our model gives us the ideal temperature and flow for when both species are present,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Zarri noted that the dam releases can draw either cold water from the bottom of the lake or warmer water from closer to the surface. Under the optimal management scenario proposed in the paper, low flows of warmer water can be released early in the season (April and May) when only green sturgeon are spawning and demand for water for agriculture has not yet ramped up. Late in the season (July to November), high flows of cold water can be released to benefit salmon and meet agricultural water needs. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The overlap period in June and early July, when both salmon and sturgeon are present in the part of the river most affected by the dam releases, is more complicated. That&#8217;s where the statistical modeling approach, which takes into account the needs of both species, provides the ideal conditions of temperature and water flow that dam managers can aim for to ensure that the river is not too warm for salmon or too cold and fast for sturgeon.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Under the current management, there is quite a long period of cold water releases starting very early in the season before the chinook salmon have really started showing up in earnest. We&#8217;re saying that you can wait until the green sturgeon have matured and moved out of the system,&#8221; Palkovacs said. &#8220;That has a side benefit in drought years, when limiting those early releases saves water for later in the year when it&#8217;s more valuable, both for salmon and for downstream water demand.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Palkovacs noted that other native species in the river, including spring and fall runs of salmon, are probably also being affected by the cold water releases. At this point, however, the researchers did not have enough information about other species to include them in their analysis.</span></p>

<p>Now in its third decade, the National Dance Project is widely recognized as one of the country&#8217;s major sources of funding for dance, supporting both the creation and touring of new works.</p>
<p>A panel of national dance artists, presenters, and arts administrators selected this year&#8217;s recipients out of 170 competitive applications. Each project is awarded $45,000 for the creation of the new work, as well as $10,000 in unrestricted general operating support.</p>
<p>Casel noted that the grant also includes touring funds for national presenters and residency centers--such as the Maggie Allesee National Center for Choreography at Florida State University and the National Center for Choreography in Akron, Ohio--where they will hold creative and technical residencies. <br/><br/>He added that the show will tour to such venues as LaMama (New York), Contemporary Art Center (New Orleans), and the American Dance Festival (Durham, North Carolina). The premiere will be at CounterPulse (San Francisco) in Fall 2020. CounterPulse is also co-presenting the work and will provide additional resources, including administrative support and space for the company&#8217;s flagship community engagement program, Dancing Around Race.<br/><br/>Casel has danced professionally in companies including Michael Clark, Russell Dumas, the Metropolitan Opera Ballet, Lar Lubovitch and&#160;Stephen Petronio, where he also served as assistant director and director of education. He has created choreography for The Barnard Project, New York University&#8217;s Second Avenue Dance Company, Da Da Dance Projects and The X Factor Dance Company of Scotland.<br/><br/>Casel earned a BFA in Dance from The Juilliard School in 1991 and an MFA from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 2007.

<p>Widely recognized for pathbreaking scholarship and hands-on training, the center has evolved from a grassroots gardening program to a full-fledged research and advocacy endeavor. CASFS has helped shape the national conversation about agroecology, food insecurity on college campuses, social justice in the food system, and more. Staff and faculty affiliates will spend the coming year assessing how the center can keep pushing the food movement forward, executive director Daniel Press said.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The landscape has changed dramatically over the past 50 years, and even in the past decade," said Press. &#8220;Our challenge is to think critically about our future and position ourselves to remain a leader for decades to come."&#160;</p>
<p>To provide faculty and staff with the opportunity to thoughtfully craft a vision for the decades ahead, the center will also take a year off from its renowned Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, an intensive six-month residential program that enrolls 39 people each year.</p>
<p>The curriculum of the apprenticeship, which began in 1973, has evolved over the years to incorporate community-supported agriculture and issues of social justice and worker welfare, but Press said it&#8217;s time for a deeper review of what the program offers and how its delivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;This pause will give us the opportunity to evaluate how we want to grow and change to meet the needs of the 21st century food system,&#8221; he said.&#160;</p>
<p>The center plans to continue all its other programs in the year ahead, including cutting-edge research, undergraduate courses and internships, offering community workshops, growing food for dining halls and campus food pantries, hosting the annual Harvest Festival, and much more.</p>
<p>Press, a professor of environmental studies who was appointed CASFS executive director in 2012, will step down as director this fall, though he will continue as associate dean for the Division of Social Sciences. Stacy Philpott, a professor of environmental studies and the Alfred &amp; Ruth Heller Chair in Agroecology, will take over in October.</p>
<h2><strong>Expanding role</strong></h2>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Farm and Garden is an important part of the campus&#8217;s efforts to address food insecurity among students, and Philpott said she wants to develop new ways to increase its support for undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make sure our students have access to fresh, local, and healthy food, as well as the opportunity to learn more about our food systems,&#8221; Philpott said. &#8220;Our students care deeply about social justice and the environment, both of which intersect with how our food is produced."</p>
<p>A 2016 UC study that found 19 percent of students reported they sometimes had gone hungry during the year. Another 23 percent said they had limited access to a variety of good-quality food because of a lack of money.</p>
<p>Last year, the center installed four &#8220;hoop houses&#8221; that allow the UC Santa Cruz Farm and Garden to provide a year-round supply of healthy produce to dining halls, food pantries, and pop-up markets on campus.</p>
<p>The Farm and Garden also provides fresh produce to the Cowell Coffee Shop for the Peoples, an innovative nontransactional food store and cafe that opened last year. The cafe is helping to address food access issues among students by providing food free of charge.</p>
<p>A new major in agroecology being developed by the Environmental Studies Department will further expand student involvement in the center. While still under review, the major may launch as early as fall 2020, according to Philpott.&#160;</p>

<p>Johnson and Grunloh are among eight recipients of the population and ecosystem dynamics fellowship awarded nationally through a competitive selection process. The program supports students pursuing doctoral degrees in population and ecosystem dynamics, as well as marine resources economics. The two-year fellowship is a focused workforce development effort to train professionals in the highly specialized field for NOAA&#8217;s science-based approach to fisheries management and living marine resources.</p>
<p>Johnson is a Ph.D. student studying applied mathematics in the context of fisheries management. She graduated from Sonoma State University with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in applied and pure mathematics in 2017. Her research focuses on forecasting harvested populations from the California current ecosystem.</p>
<p>Although many fisheries are successfully assessed with traditional age-structured models, short-lived species in variable environments, such as market squid and the Pacific sardine, are hypersensitive to recruitment fluctuations. In order to accurately predict the populations and identify optimal harvest limits, recent studies have suggested empirical dynamic modeling may be a reasonable alternative to the conventional models.</p>
<p>As a fellow, Johnson will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using empirical dynamic modeling for the assessment and management of short-lived marine species in the California current. She aims to test the prediction accuracy of empirical dynamic modeling for six commercially valuable, short-lived species and use empirical dynamic programming to derive near-optimal harvest control rules for each stock. She will then improve the performance forecast by including spatial information.</p>
<p>This research will advance fisheries modeling in general and will, in particular, help improve NOAA's ability to accurately forecast the dynamics of economically valuable, highly variable species.</p>
<p>Grunloh (B.S., '12, marine biology) is a Ph.D. student studying statistics and applied mathematics. He works as a statistician at the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center in Santa Cruz. His research interests include questions at the intersection of Bayesian statistics and quantitative fisheries management.</p>
<p>Fisheries managers use stock assessments&#8212;collections of demographic information about fisheries populations&#8212;to determine the health of the population and inform fisheries management. Modern stock assessments use models to compile data from different sources to inform management decisions about fish populations. The decision-making process, based on these models, can be simulated and evaluated via a process called Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). Presently there is no clear, objective, and practical way to determine how competing sources of information should be weighted in stock assessment models.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Grunloh will use Bayesian optimization methods together with MSE simulations to evaluate and optimize the effectiveness of stock assessment models with respect to how data sources are weighted. He aims to test these methods against existing assessment models of rockfish populations which live along the California coast.&#160;</p>
<p>This research builds upon the most current methods of data weighting, and is novel in its use of simulation together with efficient optimization algorithms to objectively calibrate stock assessment methods. Using these methods, he hopes to provide stock assessment scientists with tools to better serve population health and better inform management objectives.</p>
<p>The joint fellowship program has supported 100 population and ecosystem dynamics students and 36 marine resource economics students since its inception. Ninety-five percent of alumni remain in their field of study after completing the fellowship program.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown&#8217;s academic and residential buildings share the same stark white exterior and brownish-red tile roofing, which can be seen from far away, even on a foggy day. Maze-like pathways split off into various quads offering an array of places for students to study, socialize, or relax.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students interact in and around the dining halls and Fireside Lounge, a designated space for Crown students to meet for group work and studying. Residence halls host various activities centered around student interests like socials, video game nights, and movie nights.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Crown College is a pretty quiet college with a very good academic environment,&#8221; said Emily Kobayashi (Crown &#8216;19, bioinformatics).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this low-key, close-knit community has an oversized impact on undergraduates.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Alumni Council member and pioneer class graduate Susan Nerton (Crown &#8216;71, psychology; &#8216;87, computer and information science) had a life-changing experience at Crown. She remembers walking out to the lawns that surround the college and seeing a community of bright students excited to be there.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There was a lot of face-to-face time together, impromptu get-togethers with faculty and other students, and the education was unbelievable,&#8221; Nerton said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Vision of a science community</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown&#8217;s science culture began over 50 years ago. The college was founded in 1967 through public funds and a generous gift by the Crown Zellerbach Foundation, which supports organizations making positive impacts in their communities. Kenneth Thimann, Crown College&#8217;s founding provost, was a plant physiologist who came from Harvard University with a vision to create UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s first college dedicated primarily to the sciences. To this day, Crown holds on to its science legacy and strong community of driven students, who call themselves Crownies. Most major in one of the science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) fields and are involved in cutting-edge research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further enhancing the college&#8217;s science culture, the residential buildings are named after famous scientists like Galileo, Maxwell, and Harvey, just to name a few. Inside the residence halls, student-drawn murals, comic art, mathematical equations, and inspirational phrases line the walls.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also a sizeable population of non-science Crownies who seek out Crown&#8217;s interdisciplinary approach to education. The mix of students brings different perspectives to the coursework and allows for deeper conversations to develop.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The student body is extremely diverse, and they really care for each other,&#8221; said Crown Core lecturer Marilyn Patton. &#8220;They look beyond labels immediately.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Science, Technology, and Society</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown&#8217;s theme is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science, Technology, and Society</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Students examine the social impacts of technology and its ethical implications. Crown faculty understand that students must go beyond the technical aspects of science to effectively navigate the complexity of today&#8217;s world and become responsible citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Today&#8217;s technology is really the product of a long history, of a philosophical framework, of economic interests, and has both positive and negative implications for us as individuals and as a society,&#8221; said Manel Camps, Crown College provost and associate professor in microbiology and environmental toxicology.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown&#8217;s 10-week core course, commonly referred to as Core, is</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a required five-unit class for first-year students. This interdisciplinary class examines the social impacts of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), surveillance technology, social media, transhumanism, and self-driving cars.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Crown&#8217;s core class places technology in its intellectual and social context,&#8221; said Camps.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drawing from old and new texts, students complete writing assignments, take part in online discussions, and complete a research project in groups of five to six.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students also have a chance to show off their creative talents. Faculty encourage their students to write flash fiction, short science fiction stories that indirectly refer to the topics they learn about in their core course and science classes. Stories are reviewed by a science fiction writer and then published.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Suddenly students are going far beyond equation-solving to dreaming of scenarios that might happen in the future,&#8221; Patton said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following recommendations from the college&#8217;s Alumni Council, Crown is encouraging further alumni engagement in the classroom. A group of alumni have already started to support Core through participation in classroom discussions and by providing mentorship during the research project component of the course.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students complete Core with foundational academic skills preparing them for rigorous coursework, and a valuable network of alumni mentors and peer connections.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Trailblazing programs&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown is one of the colleges that hosts classes for the College Scholars Program, a prestigious program that immerses students in challenging coursework and research. Students can choose from a number of interdisciplinary courses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown&#8217;s College Scholars classes have a unique focus on foundational career competencies such as digital literacy, teamwork, and problem solving, which are transferable skills between different disciplines and highly sought out by employers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We recruit lecturers outside of academia to teach subjects that are narrowly represented on campus, offering our students a unique window into industry-related, professional careers,&#8221; Camps said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown hosts two entrepreneurship classes, which attract many students in and out of the college. One of the classes focuses on for-profit organizations, while the other focuses on social entrepreneurship.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown also hosts its own </span><a href="https://crown.ucsc.edu/activities/social-fiction-conference/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Fiction Conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This event, building on the college&#8217;s theme of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science, Technology, and Society</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ties together Crown&#8217;s academia and residential education to provide students with the opportunity to showcase their creative work. Kobayashi, the recent bioinformatics graduate, presented a screening of her fictional stop-motion film on mind-cloning rights during her first year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In my video, I got to talk about a lot of themes we discussed in the core class,&#8221; Kobayashi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Kobayashi prepares for her Ph.D. program in bioinformatics and systems biology at UC San Diego, the teachings of Crown College still resonate with her.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I will still stop and think, &#8216;What about the ethics?&#8217;&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Deeply involved alumni</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through grassroots fundraising, Crown College&#8217;s pioneer class raised $75,000 to fund the college&#8217;s library renovations. Crown alumni launched the fundraiser in 2016 in honor of Crown&#8217;s upcoming 50th anniversary, which took place a year later. They were responding to a critical need. The library was deteriorating and students were running out of spaces to meet.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other generous contributions from alumni and donors went toward enhancing Crown&#8217;s educational experience through renovations to the Fireside Lounge; Core re-transformation that resulted in smaller class sizes and the addition of co-curricular activities; increased mentored internship opportunities; and the expansion in the number and variety of classes offered at Crown.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The experience of students is paramount,&#8221; said Henry Chu (Crown &#8216;72, history), a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee. &#8220;Enrichment of education for these kids is my hope and goal, whether it&#8217;s by space or by opportunity or by curriculum.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To strengthen the permanent stream of resources available to enhance the Crown student experience, the Crown Alumni Council is in the planning phase of an endowment campaign. The goal is to add $1 million to the Crown endowment by 2021, the 50th anniversary of Crown&#8217;s first graduating class.&#160;</span></p>

Your calls alerted us, then helped us determine there was no danger or threat. The person was a teen with a toy that closely resembled a firearm. <br/><br/>We understand, given the mass shootings we&#8217;ve seen across the nation, that notifications like the one you received can be unnerving. That hour between Cruz Alerts was a very long one for many people. Decisions to send alerts are not made lightly. The safety of our campus community is always our top priority, and we sent it out of an abundance of caution. <br/><br/>The incident highlights how our community can work together to keep our campus safe: If you see something or someone suspicious, hear someone talking about harming themselves or others, call our Dispatch Center at 831-459-2231, ext. 1. In an emergency, immediately call 911.<br/><br/>Our department is currently training various campus groups on how best to respond during these types of incidents. In October, we plan to hold additional trainings for anyone in our campus community who wants to come. We will notify the campus and post more details on our <a href="https://police.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">department website</a> as they become available. <br/><br/>Finally, remember campus has resources available to anyone impacted by Wednesday&#8217;s incident. In addition to support services offered by staff in our colleges, <a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> provides assistance for students. The <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Employee Assistance Program</a> can provide counseling and support for staff and faculty. In difficult times, it is vital that we support one another.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Nader Oweis, Chief of Police</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bb6fa1f78072701734bebd3c992fc1c8"><name>rosales-aauw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Psychology Ph.D. student receives AAUW fellowship</title><summary>Christine Rosales, a Ph.D. student in psychology, has been awarded a 2019-20 fellowship from the American Association of University Women (AAUW). </summary><keywords>AAUW, fellowship, psychology</keywords><start-date>1566457200000</start-date><display-name>Rosales-AAUW</display-name><path>/2019/08/rosales-aauw</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/08/rosales-aauw</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1566512750313</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1566512814133</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt>8313349325</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Program aims to tackle barriers women face in education</article-subhead><article-text><p>Christine Rosales, a Ph.D. student in psychology, has been awarded a 2019-20 fellowship from the American Association of University Women (AAUW).</p>
<p>The fellowships recognize recipients whose academic work and community projects empower women and girls.</p>
<p>Rosales, who received the AAUW's American Fellowship, is pursuing a doctorate in social psychology with an emphasis on feminist studies and critical race and ethnic studies. <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/02/bullock-blum.html">Her work</a> explores what she calls the "hidden resistance" of Latinas&#8212;the everyday actions and attitudes that push back against social injustice.&#160;</p>
<p>AAUW is one of the world&#8217;s oldest leading supporters of graduate women&#8217;s education. Established in 1881, it is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that focuses on promoting education and equity for women and girls. For the coming academic year, the group has awarded more than $4 million in fellowships and grants to roughly 260 scholars, research projects, and programs.</p>
<p>In its statement announcing the fellowship recipients, AAUW noted that financial support for students is especially important because women are disproportionately burdened by&#160;<a href="http://www.aauw.org/research/deeper-in-debt/">student debt</a>,&#160;and their ability to repay loans is hampered by a&#160;<a href="https://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/">lifelong pay gap</a>&#160;that&#160;affects women in nearly every profession.</p>

The project is scheduled to continue through 2023. This exciting project will add a new academic building and residence halls to the college; refurbish existing 50-year-old buildings with more durable materials; maintain the college's unique architectural style and color; and make Kresge more accessible for those with disabilities.&#160;<br/><br/>However, with construction, there will be impacts to parking and roads in the area. See below for key dates and closures. Thank you all in advance for your patience as this exciting project comes to life:<br/><br/><strong>Aug. 26:</strong>&#160;Fencing will be erected around the work area. This will include Lot 142, which will be repurposed as part of the foundation for the new academic building, and thus will no longer be available for parking.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Aug. 29:</strong>&#160;Lots 142, 143 and 147 will be closed 7-9 a.m. for fire-hydrant testing. All lots must be clear of cars and will not be accessible to any traffic during this time.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Sept. 3-19:</strong>&#160;Porter Kresge Road will be closed to the public from Lot 143 to North Perimeter Lot 150.&#160;<br/><br/>The lower segment of Porter Kresge Road from Heller Drive (the Porter entrance) to Lot 143 still will be accessible to the public, and North Perimeter Lot 150 will be accessible via upper Heller Drive, north of McLaughlin. Large vehicles and trucks will be utilizing the lower road and may block traffic as they enter or exit Kresge. Flaggers will be directing traffic if trucks block a portion of the road for a period of time.<br/><br/><strong>Sept. 20:</strong>&#160;Porter Kresge Road temporarily reopens for student for move-in weekend.<br/><br/><strong>Sept. 21-25:</strong>&#160;Lot 145 will be closed to the public through April 2021; portions of Lot 143 will be closed to the public through April 2021.<br/><br/><strong>Oct. 15 to April 2021:</strong>&#160;Porter Kresge Road from Lot 143 to North Perimeter Lot 150 once again will be closed to the public. Only construction and emergency vehicles will have access.&#160;<br/><br/>For more details about the project, visit the&#160;<a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kresge special report</a>&#160;in the online&#160;campus newscenter.<br/><br/>For questions about the project, contact project coordinators&#160;<a href="mailto:tanyag@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tanya Guerrera</a>&#160;or&#160;<a href="mailto:kernsj@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jolie Kerns</a>.&#160;<br/><br/>TAPS will continue to post traffic and parking-impact updates related to this project on&#160;<a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our website</a> and on social media.

<p>This volume is the fruit of a life's work, a gift to aspiring and experienced orchardists alike. Master gardener Orin Martin captivates readers with the skill of a storyteller, deftly carrying them along every step of the way, from fruit-tree selection and soil preparation to planting, pruning, care, and harvest. Writing with lyricism and melody, Martin has accomplished the impossible: He has written a can't-put-down grower's manual, a text that's destined to become a classic.</p>
<p>Martin developed his knowledge and talent as an educator over more than four decades at UC Santa Cruz, where he manages the Alan Chadwick Garden.</p>
<p>"Fruit trees are just addictive," says Martin. "Learning to grow fruit trees is fascinating, humbling, and rewarding."</p>
<p>In <em>Fruit Trees for Every </em>Garden, Martin gives readers everything they need to become successful fruit farmers, including "bite-sized, digestible morsels" of the science behind the steps he carefully lays out. "This is a book for curious gardeners&#8212;those who want step-by-step instructions and a little bit more," he says.</p>
<p>Graphics and line drawings illustrate key principles and concepts, including how to build a compost pile and pruning, a subject to which Martin devotes 50 pages of his 265-page book. "That's appropriate, because you will spend more time pruning and training than all the other activities combined," he notes.</p>
<p>Pruning warrants careful demystification in part because it is "scary and counterintuitive. The harder you cut back a branch, the stronger it grows." Pruning can overwhelm and paralyze home gardeners, who tend to be either "whackers or haircutters." Moderation is the key, he notes, adding that pruning can also reclaim an old, unproductive tree.</p>
<p><u>A thorough, engaging guide to success</u></p>
<p>Martin coauthored <em>Fruit Trees for Every Garden</em> with his daughter Manjula Martin, an author and the managing editor of the literary journal <em>Zoetrope: All-Story</em>. His wife, Stephanie Martin, created etchings that grace the beginning of each chapter, as well as the illustrations; restaurateur Alice Waters wrote the forward, and Liz Birnbaum provided dozens of photographs.</p>
<p>Through his work at UC Santa Cruz, Martin has taught nearly 5,000 apprentices, undergraduates, and home gardeners, all of whom have been fortunate to hear from the master himself about the art and science of growing fruit trees organically. Martin became smitten with apples more than 30 years ago. The 3-acre Chadwick Garden is now home to more than 120 varieties of apples, as well as an extensive collection of pears, citrus, and stone fruits, including apricots, peaches, nectarines, plums, pluots, and apriums.</p>
<p>Martin describes gardening as "a process of observation, decision, action, and reaction. Rinse, repeat." Successful organic gardening is based on understanding the ecological systems at work in and around one's trees, and observation is the key to success, he notes. A hand-lettered sign posted prominently in the Chadwick garden proclaims, "The best fertilizer is the footsteps of the farmer or the shadow of the gardener. Walk the garden daily. Look around."</p>
<p><u>A handbook for all regions</u></p>
<p>Although he has spent his career on the West Coast, Martin has Massachusetts roots, and he has written a book of value to orchardists and gardeners across the country. USDA hardiness zones guide readers to fruits and varieties that will do well where they live. He also provides an extensive list of resources, including nurseries, soil-testing labs, and educational resources.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most challenging lesson Martin offers is that planting a fruit tree is not, ideally, an impulsive thing; it takes 12-36 months to identify and prepare a site.</p>
<p>"If your soil is in poor condition, you might be wise to engage in a rigorous soil-building program for as long as one to three years," he advises. Compost and cover crops are Martin's "tools for improvement," and he shares his expertise with zeal, ending the section on compost with a friendly request: "Please, I implore you: You must make compost!" Additionally, aspiring orchardists want to create a biodiverse ecosystem, with flowers that attract pollinators and beneficial insects, and birds that help control pests. "It's not just the tree, it's the environment the tree is growing in," says Martin. "What you hope to create is a little slice of paradise in your backyard."</p>
<p>For those with patience, and those who lack it, Martin's book will greatly enhance their chances of success. He certainly understands the irresistible urge to plant fruit trees, which he links to humans' "long and storied" relationship with fruit trees. Archaeobotanists have uncovered evidence that orchards may predate ancient grain production by 1,000 years or more, and studies show trees in the landscape have a calming effect on people, he proclaims proudly. Moreover, trees are the &#8220;lungs of the planet," removing carbon dioxide, sequestering carbon, and "exhaling" oxygen. And at the end of each season, the gardener's commitment and dedication is rewarded with the best prize: fruit.</p>
<p>"Your relationship with a tree is like a conversation&#8212;a really long conversation," says Martin, who wants more than anything to empower more gardeners to begin those conversations.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c0ba9dbd8072701734bebd3c62d844ef"><name>warburton-dance-education</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ted Warburton named inaugural Senior Fellow of Institute for Dance Education Research, Policy &amp;

The goal is to support public policies that promote opportunities for high quality dance education in schools that are accessible, affordable, and equitable to all students.<br/><br/>A co-author of the proposal, Warburton described the Institute as a &#8220;unique and unprecedented opportunity to conduct and translate policy-relevant research on dance to transform educational environments for children, families, and communities.&#8221; <br/><br/>He also spoke to the academic value of dance as a physical art form, noting that researchers increasingly find that the process of learning is deeply physical. <br/><br/>&#8220;People understand and retain information better when they experience it through the senses&#8212;and such &#8216;embodied learning&#8217; has been shown to be especially powerful for young children,&#8221; said Warburton. &#8220;Cognitions and emotions are interwoven,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And that describes the experience of dance.&#8221;<br/><br/>Warburton is the recipient of the National Dance Education Organization&#8217;s 2016 Outstanding Dance Researcher Award.

<p>That's the conclusion of Julie Guthman, author of the new book, <em>Wilted: Pathogens, Chemicals, and the Fragile Future of the Strawberry Industry</em>. Guthman, a professor of social sciences at UC Santa Cruz, is arguably one of the most knowledgeable scholars of the industry, having studied it for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>In <em>Wilted</em>, Guthman writes that a confluence of factors unique to the state's strawberry industry are jeopardizing the status quo and making the industry's future quite uncertain. Those factors include high up-front costs, labor shortages, increased pesticide regulation, the sky-high cost of coastal acreage, and the impacts of climate change, including hotter and drier conditions.</p>
<p>But the biggest factor that set the crisis in motion, according to Guthman, was the industry's early embrace of chemical-intensive fumigants to control soil-borne pathogens that cause strawberry plants to wilt and die. Effective but controversial, fumigants offered a "quick fix" approach that is common to large-scale industrial agriculture. But their use has had far-reaching repercussions that compound the bind berry growers find themselves in today.</p>
<p>"The strawberry industry co-evolved with all these factors&#8212;the plants, soils, chemicals, climate, regulations, labor, land prices, science, and marketing&#8212;and fumigants were the glue that held it all together," said Guthman.</p>
<p>Fumigants, including the notorious methyl bromide, ushered in the berry boom. These chemicals, which effectively sterilize the soil and rid it of disease, made it possible to grow berries on the same land year after year. Coupled with the breeding of new varieties, fumigation transformed what had been a seasonal luxury crop into a massive, year-round behemoth of California agriculture. Strawberries today are the fourth highest-grossing crop in the state, and 88% of the strawberries in the United States are grown in California. Fumigation opened the door to growing for a national market&#8212;and to making strawberry production the most intensive agrochemical regime of all the state's crops.</p>
<p>Guthman said this set of interlocking threats, which she calls an "assemblage," jeopardizes the future of the industry. As part of her research for <em>Wilted</em>, Guthman interviewed 75 growers, 50 workers, and dozens of industry representatives. "My conclusions likely won't satisfy the industry or the farming idealists who are calling for a more integrated, agroecological approach," she said. "A truly integrated system would require scaling down to an extent that the numbers just don't pan out. Growers can't pay the rent on high-value strawberry land if strawberries are a minor crop."</p>
<p>Since the loss of methyl bromide&#8212;it was finally taken out of strawberry fruit production in 2017&#8212;new pathogens never before detected in strawberry fields have appeared, and a host of other problems are catching up with the industry.</p>
<p>Decades of reliance on fumigants freed breeders to focus on appearance, durability, and productivity rather than disease resistance. And being able to grow year-round yielded volumes&#8212;and profits&#8212;that kept pace with the rising cost and demand for land in California's berry-friendly coastal regions.</p>
<p>These days berry producers are embracing innovations, including organic alternatives to chemical fumigants, soil-less growing systems, and breeding for disease resistance. However, Guthman nevertheless sees a difficult path ahead for the industry. "There's very little room to maneuver. There are no easy outs," she said, noting that the immigration crackdown is contributing to labor shortages, and wages and land costs continue to increase.</p>
<p>"The shakeout and consolidation is already happening," she said. "Growers are going out of business. I just heard about an independent farm in Oxnard that now sells to a major shipper. People are letting go of acreage, and the big companies are taking the top talent."</p>
<p>The takeaway is "the problem with solutions," said Guthman. "Sometimes the quick, easy fix creates a big mess. We need a more truly integrated agricultural science to address the stubborn, interlocking consequences of monoculture."</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The proposed draft revises the existing Policy and Procedures on Curation and Repatriation of Human Remains and Cultural Items. The policy addresses the treatment and repatriation of Native American and Native Hawaiian human remains and cultural items under the University&#8217;s stewardship and the University&#8217;s compliance with the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The proposed draft was developed by the Cultural Affiliation and Repatriation Policy Advisory established by Provost Brown. The group is comprised of four members nominated by the Academic Senate, and four members nominated by the Native American Advisory Council, a body established by President Napolitano to advise on a broad range of issues pertaining to Native Americans and Native Hawaiians at the University.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The proposed draft policy is <a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/policiesinreview/cultural_affiliation_repatriation">available online</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The revised policy is substantially different and more detailed than the <a href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2500489/HumanCulturalRemains">currently issued policy</a> (2001). Significant updates include:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>Creates a list of principles that emphasizes the repatriation of Native American and Native Hawaiian human remains as a fundamental objective and value of the University. Proposed draft, &#167; III.B.</li>
<li>Reconstitutes the Systemwide Committee and Campus Committees to strengthen Native American representation. Proposed draft, &#167; V.A.</li>
<li>Shifts final approvals of repatriation to the campus from UCOP to reduce delays in repatriation; the Systemwide Committee and UCOP will provide an oversight role and consider appeals of campus decisions. Proposed draft, &#167; V.E.4.</li>

It was 2008 and the bottom had dropped out of the economy. He and his girlfriend had both lost their jobs and, eventually, their house. Then, one night, he watched </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fight Club.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey had grown up rough, living on the streets and dealing drugs when he was young, and as he watched a scene in the 1999 movie starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, something clicked. In the scene, Brad Pitt&#8217;s character holds a gun to the head of a convenience store clerk, demands his identification, and asks the man what he wanted to be when he grew up. When the puzzled clerk says he wanted to be a veterinarian, Pitt&#8217;s character tells the man he&#8217;ll check back in six months and if the clerk isn&#8217;t taking steps toward his goal, he&#8217;ll murder him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I saw that and thought, &#8216;I&#8217;d wanted to be a veterinarian too,&#8217;&#8221; said Bailey (College Nine &#8217;15, biochemistry and molecular biology). He&#8217;d been taking classes at Cabrillo College, thinking he&#8217;d major in philosophy, but after the movie, decided to work toward a degree in veterinary medicine.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the way, the man who some people said never had a future fell in love with biology and chemistry and got into graduate school thanks to the Summer Research Experience program at UC Santa Cruz, which receives funding from Monterey Bay Aquarium Director and alumna Julie Packard (Crown &#8217;74, biology; MA, &#8217;78). This year, he earned a doctorate in biochemistry and molecular biology, and is now doing cancer research at the University of Maryland, Baltimore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was just overjoyed that he&#8217;d done it (got his Ph.D.),&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz STEM Diversity Office Director Yulianna Ortega of Bailey, who was in the first cohort of Packard Scholars. &#8220;There were many obstacles that could have deterred Patrick from going on, but his resilience paid off, as did his talents.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ortega added that stories like Patrick&#8217;s demonstrate the importance and impact of philanthropic support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With her help, we are changing the directions of students&#8217; lives. We focus our efforts on students with the greatest needs&#8212;for example, community college transfer students, who have fewer opportunities to gain research experience,&#8221; said Ortega. &#8220;We know that there will be more students like Patrick in the future.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, two-thirds of all the students who have been supported by this program have gone on to STEM careers after graduation.</span></p>
<p><strong>A rough beginning</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey, now 43, grew up dirt poor. He and his single mom lived in the woods and then in a converted horse barn on a communal farm on the northern edge of Santa Cruz. Food and money were scarce and so was supervision.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was a wild child,&#8221; Bailey said by phone from his Maryland home. &#8220;I did what I wanted because no one was watching. I ran amok. By the time my mom realized she needed to do something about it, it was too late. I was already set in my ways. I was on my way to becoming what I was going to be.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He dropped out of high school at 16, couch-surfed or squatted in vacant buildings, became addicted to drugs and, by the time he was 19, he was selling them on the street. But a near-death experience changed everything and Bailey turned to Christianity. He got clean.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other part of Bailey&#8217;s story was that he&#8217;d always been intelligent. While high school bored him, he got top grades in junior college and earned high marks when he transferred to UC Santa Cruz. However, because of circumstances, he wasn&#8217;t able to get into a research lab his junior year, and so, in spite of his academic record, didn&#8217;t get a single interview after applying to graduate schools his senior year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s where the UC Santa Cruz STEM Diversity Office and the Packard Scholars program stepped in. Bailey was one of 10 students awarded an eight-week, paid summer internship in a research lab. The program was funded through Packard's support of the Dean&#8217;s Fund for Diversity in Science in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, because of his research experience, Bailey won multiple interviews and was accepted into every program that had conversations with him. He chose the University of Maryland, Baltimore, where he completed his Ph.D. in less than four years and is now a post-doc fellow. The overarching theme of his research involves how, in some cases, chemotherapy may actually contribute to cancer relapse after therapy.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Finding answers</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now married and the father of an 8-year-old daughter, Bailey said no one gave him a shot until he got to college. No one told him in high school about grants or scholarships available for low-income students, he said. Nobody said there was a chance for him to get a UC degree.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, later, there was a group of women who did take a chance on him, Bailey said. They included Sue Tappero, former director of the Math, Engineering, Science Achievement Program at Cabrillo College; Ortega and Malika Bell of the UC Santa Cruz STEM Diversity Office; Claudia Parrish of the campus Services for Transfer and Re-entry (STARS) program, who is now retired; and, of course, Packard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey said if there was one thing he could tell students who don&#8217;t think they could go to college, it would be to never count themselves out. But he grew quiet when asked if there was a part of his personality that helped him succeed.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s that I&#8217;ve been through a lot in life and made it through a lot of hard things, and I knew my abilities,&#8221; he said finally. &#8220;Because science is hard. It&#8217;s a fickle taskmaster, the hardest thing you&#8217;ll do in life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But for every 10 failed experiments, there is the one that works, and there is no other feeling in the world like it. It&#8217;s something you create from your thoughts. You put an experiment together, collaborate to make it happen, and then you watch it come out the other side &#8230; and there you are answering a question no one ever answered before, and, for all the heartache and pain, it&#8217;s so worth it.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cf4622208072701734bebd3cb0f175e4"><name>undergraduate-education-appt</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> David Draper appointed faculty director of Undergraduate Honors</title><summary>The Division of Undergraduate Education is pleased to announce the appointment of David Draper, as Faculty Director of the Undergraduate Honors Programs, effective July 1, 2019.</summary><start-date>1566802800000</start-date><display-name> David Draper Appointed Faculty Director of Undergraduate Honors</display-name><path>/2019/08/undergraduate-education-appt</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/08/undergraduate-education-appt</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1566845574903</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1567550218212</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>The Division of Undergraduate Education is pleased to announce the appointment of </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/draper&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567636503500000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVPs1Tn1DLjBChbTAdszZd-1m2sQ" href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/draper" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>David <span class="il">Draper</span></span></a><span>, as Faculty Director of the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://honors.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567636503500000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPRyEpz3VmGz-rdkM9GrOPry_2Mg" href="http://honors.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Undergraduate </a></span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://honors.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567636503500000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPRyEpz3VmGz-rdkM9GrOPry_2Mg" href="http://honors.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Honors Programs</a></span><span>, effective July 1, 2019.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Faculty Director oversees UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s <a href="https://honors.ucsc.edu/honors-programs/college-scholars/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">College Scholars Program</a> (CSP).&#160; In collaboration with the <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Academic Senate</a>&#8217;s Joint Honors Subcommittee, the CSP seeks to bring to our campus diverse cohorts of high-achieving students within a challenging year-long program.&#160; Students will be prepared to take advantage of <a href="https://ugr.ue.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">undergraduate research opportunities</a> early in their careers.&#160; The 2019-20 fall cohort is expected to include about 100 students at <a href="http://cowell.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cowell College</a>, <a href="http://crown.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crown College</a>, <a href="http://merrill.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merrill College</a>, and <a href="http://porter.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Porter College</a>, with the spring 2020 cohort adding another 100 or more students from all colleges on campus.&#160; The Director also works with honor societies such as Golden Key and Phi Beta Kappa, and is a resource for colleges and departments developing new honors opportunities or seeking to grow existing ones.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;My own background and interests have been almost exclusively in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects,&#8221; said Draper, &#8220;but I look forward to working with students and faculty from all Divisions on campus, and all regions of the world of ideas, to enrich the undergraduate honors experience at UCSC.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Draper is a Professor of Statistics in the <a href="http://engineering.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Baskin School of Engineering&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/statistics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Department of Statistics</a>. He received his Ph.D. in 1981 from the University of California, Berkeley, and has since taught and worked on research projects at the University of Chicago; the RAND Corporation; the University of Washington; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Bath (U.K.); the University of Neuchatel (Switzerland); and UC Santa Cruz. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Statistical Association, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the Royal Statistical Society, and the International Society for Bayesian Analysis.&#160;</p>
<p dir="ltr">His research concerns methodological developments in Bayesian statistics and data science, with particular emphasis on hierarchical modeling, Bayesian nonparametric methods, model specification and model uncertainty, quality assessment, risk assessment, and applications in the environmental, medical, and social sciences. He is the author or co-author of about 150 contributions to the research literature, which together have been cited about 15,500 times. Since 1993 he has been PI or co-PI on 23 grants totaling about $12 million. His current applied projects include a collaboration with medical researchers at Stanford on the measurement of quality of care at neonatal intensive care units; this work has documented alarming differences in quality of care as a function of the ethnicity of the baby and the socio-economic status of the mother.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From 2001 to 2007 Draper served as the founding chair of the Applied Mathematics and Statistics Department at UCSC, and in 2002 he was President of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis. He has been an Associate Editor for 6 leading journals, and he has organized or co-organized 6 international research conferences.

<p dir="ltr">&#8220;David&#8217;s mixture of scholarship, administrative prowess, and dedication to students, especially undergraduates, is inspirational,&#8221; noted Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education Richard Hughey. &#8220;During and since building campus excellence in Bayesian statistics and applied mathematics, David has been recognized as an inspirational teacher with a focus on engaging classes in real-world problem solving and the careful cultivation of learning.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Draper replaces Matt O&#8217;Hara, who served as Director since 2014.&#160; Please join me in thanking Matt for his significant contributions to the undergraduate honors program, especially the growth and expansion of this enriching experience for our undergraduate students.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Division of Undergraduate Education</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d40398fd8072701734bebd3cbadfe535"><name>massaro-app</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Massaro introduces app to boost literacy</title><summary>Dominic Massaro, a professor emeritus of psychology, has developed a new iPhone app designed to help children learn to read. </summary><keywords>iPhone, app, literacy</keywords><start-date>1566889200000</start-date><display-name>Massaro-App</display-name><path>/2019/08/massaro-app</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/08/massaro-app</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1566925100506</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1566925100506</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/08/images/massaro_350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/08/images/massaro_350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>massaro_350.jpg</name><display-name>massaro_350.jpg</display-name><file-size>19863</file-size><width>350</width><height>254</height></image><image-alt>Screenshot of the app in the App Store</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/08/images/massaro_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/08/images/massaro_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>massaro_80.jpg</name><display-name>massaro_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>3297</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Screenshot of the app in the App Store</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dominic Massaro, a professor emeritus of psychology, has developed a new iPhone app designed to help children learn to read. The app, which also helps people learning English as a second language, allows users to experience spoken and written English in a natural, real-world context.</p>
<p>The app, "<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/understand-my-world/id1298250806">Understand My World</a>," immerses users in written words, which jump starts their comprehension, said Massaro.</p>
<p>"The app encourages pre-literate and partially literate children to discover written language and learn to read," said Massaro, whose research focused on how people understand language.</p>
<p>As a cognitive psychologist, Massaro discovered parallels between understanding speech and reading. He developed a fuzzy logical model of perception that was capable of quantitatively describing how people perceive spoken language and how they read.</p>
<p>However, Massaro was puzzled by the different ways children learn these two modalities: Children learn spoken language from birth but typically don't learn how to read until they go to school, or have direct instruction. The proven strategy for teaching reading involves phonics, in which children learn the sounds that letters make and how these sounds are blended together in order to access written words.</p>
<p>Massaro reasoned that if children were exposed to as much written language as spoken language, they would <a href="https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.ucsc.edu/dist/0/158/files/2015/02/2012-07MassaroFinal2.pdf">learn to read naturally</a>&#8212;or at least learn the mechanics of reading without direct instruction.</p>
<p>The new app provides the "immersive" environment Massaro sought, as the phone's camera and microphone help users understand spoken words and see written language.</p>
<p>"The app is designed to be intuitive and seamless to use," said Massaro. "Images captured by the camera are labeled and defined in both speech and writing. Participants speak into their device to record their speech or ask questions, then the app presents the dictated words or answers in both spoken and written form."</p>
<p>The rate of speech and size of the letters are easily adjusted to accommodate all different learners, and the microphone allows user to ask a variety of open-ended questions, such as "Tell me about&#8230;" or "Define&#8230;" and "What is&#8230;?". A required internet connection preserves the participants' anonymity, and indecent or offensive words are not acknowledged in dictation or used in responses, noted Massaro.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ddef543d8072701734bebd3cba431d1d"><name>campus-data-center-vpn-outage</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus and Data Center VPN Outage</title><summary>The campus and data center virtual private network (VPN) services are experiencing an outage as of 8PM this evening, August 28. </summary><start-date>1566975600000</start-date><display-name>Campus and Data Center VPN Outage</display-name><path>/2019/08/campus-data-center-vpn-outage</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2019/08/campus-data-center-vpn-outage</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1567091544322</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1567091544322</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>The campus and data center virtual private network (VPN) services are experiencing an outage as of 8PM this evening, August 28.

2016--a work of speculative fiction about a young woman who escapes a life of slavery on a Georgia plantation and heads north on a subterranean train.</p>
<p>The novel won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, along with rave reviews from almost everyone. <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> described it as &#8220;stunningly daring.&#8221; <em>NPR</em> hailed it as &#8220;An American masterpiece.&#8221; Oprah Winfrey called it &#8220;heart-stopping.&#8221; And Barrack Obama said it was &#8220;terrific.&#8221;</p>
<p>On September 19, Bookshop Santa Cruz and The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz will present a special reading with Whitehead from his latest book, <em>The Nickel Boys</em>, at Peace United Church in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><em>The Nickel Boys</em> examines another slice of institutionalized racism in American history, this time told through the story of two boys at an abusive reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida. The novel is based on the true story of a reform school in the Florida panhandle that existed for more than a century and traumatized thousands of children.</p>
<p>"<em>The Nickel Boys</em> chronicles the depths of racism, carceral torture, and child abuse in modern America&#8221; said Tyler Stovall, dean of humanities at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;As the nation commemorates the 400th anniversary of slavery, Colson Whitehead's novel serves as a powerful reminder of the fact that the after-effects of black slavery lingered long after the Emancipation Proclamation, and in some forms are still with us today."</p>
<p>"With the recent passing of Toni Morrison, Colson Whitehead is perhaps the preeminent novelist of the black experience writing in America today,&#8221; added Stovall.&#160;&#8220;His Pulitzer Prize-winning novel <em>The Underground Railroad</em> is a classic blend of history and fantasy."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz history professor Greg O&#8217;Malley noted that the popularity of Whitehead&#8217;s work speaks not only to his talents as a writer, but also to Americans&#8217; interest in the history of slavery.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think many people understand, on an almost unconscious level, that slavery is the original sin behind many modern American problems, so we gravitate to novels like <em>The Underground Railroad</em>&#160;to understand ourselves&#8221; said O&#8217;Malley. &#8220;Fiction offers an especially valuable way to engage with slavery because historical methodologies are often stymied by the lack of sources from enslaved people&#8217;s perspectives. Very few enslaved people had the opportunity to write their own stories for posterity, in letters, diaries, etc., so as a historian of slavery, I have very limited access to the voices and perspectives of enslaved women and men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Novelists, especially novelists like Whitehead who are deeply knowledgeable about American history and culture, can open windows on aspects of the past through imagination that historians can&#8217;t open with textual evidence,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The same interest that draws us to Whitehead&#8217;s novels, I think, is what currently has Americans fascinated by the anniversary of the arrival of the first Africans in Virginia, 400 years ago. We know that the legacies of slavery define us, in many ways, and we want to understand how.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raised in Manhattan, Whitehead worked at the <em>Village Voice</em>, writing reviews of television, books, and music, after graduating from Harvard College. His work has also appeared in such publications as the <em>New York Times, The New Yorker, Harpers&#8217;</em> and <em>Granta</em>. His previous books include <em>The Noble Hustle,&#160;Zone One,&#160;Sag Harbor,&#160;The Intuitionist,&#160;John Henry Days,&#160;Apex Hides the Hurt</em>, and <em>The Colossus of New York</em>.</p>
<p>Academy Award-winning director Barry Jenkins (<em>Moonlight</em>) is currently working on a television series based on <em>The Underground Railroad</em> for Amazon. Whitehead recently told the <em>New York Times</em> that he &#8220;offers occasional advice on the adaptation, but isn&#8217;t heavily involved,&#8221; adding &#8220;I wrote it once and I don&#8217;t want to write it again.&#8221;</p>
