400;">Ricky Bluthenthal </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Merrill &#8217;86, History and Sociology)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;trailblazer, advocate, and champion of health equity and social justice for disadvantaged and marginalized groups&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been named the 2022 Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award recipient.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award is awarded annually to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">graduates of the division whose careers are characterized by their sustained and exemplary contributions to society through research, practice, education, policy, or service. Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell had high praise for this year's alumni award recipient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dr. Bluthenthal&#8217;s influential and cutting-edge social research paves the way for forward thinking in every topic he studies,&#8221; Mitchell said. &#8220;UC Santa Cruz's Social Sciences division is honored to name Dr. Bluthenthal as the 2022 Alumni Award recipient.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The award reception will be held on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 20th as part of </span><a href="https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Bluthenthal will be joined in discussion by Alicia Riley and Naya Jones</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professors of Sociology and core faculty members in UCSC's Global and Community Health program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I'm aware of many deserving social science graduates at UC Santa Cruz, who've done amazing things, and the folks who had been awarded previously are incredible,&#8221; Bluthenthal said. &#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased to be recognized by UCSC.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bluthenthal has published over 170 manuscripts in peer-reviewed scientific journals,&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is on the editorial board of the International Journal of Drug Policy and Drug and Alcohol&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dependence, and is an Associate Editor of the Addiction Section for Annals of&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicine.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has received the Senior Scholar Award from the Drugs and Society Section of the American Sociological Association in 2020 and the Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Public Interest Award from the Society of Addiction Psychology (Division 50) of the American Psychological Association in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bluthenthal says that his time at UC Santa Cruz was life-changing and instrumental in shaping his career path.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had access to incredible faculty who were willing to let me sit in their office and ask them thousands of questions about life, research, and teaching,&#8221; Bluthenthal said. &#8220;Even after I graduated, the faculty that I worked with were always in my corner, giving moral support, and even sometimes intervening directly on my behalf. My experience was amazing, and I feel very indebted to UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at UCSC, Bluthenthal was involved in the creation of the campus-wide student government, the anti-apartheid divestment movement, and the adoption of an ethnic studies breadth requirement. He also was a part of the Third World and Native American Student press collective </span><a href="https://twanaspress.com/about-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TWANAS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where he met his wife, Nancy Berglass </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Merrill &#8217;85, Community Studies)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the </span><a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/awards/alumni-awards/dis-soc-sci-alumni-award/previous-winners/nberglass.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2010 recipient </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating in &#8217;86, Bluthenthal went on to work at the Institute for Policy Studies, where he focused on issues of urban poverty for two years. He then went on to pursue his Ph.D. in sociology at UC Berkeley, during which time he was hired to conduct one of the first HIV epidemiology studies among people who inject drugs in the Bay Area. The study found high rates of HIV among individuals living in Richmond, Oakland, and East Palo Alto who inject drugs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the face of that, I had to grapple with the fact that it was obvious the government wasn't going to step in to try and arrest the spread of HIV in this population,&#8221; Bluthenthal said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the high rates of infection the study uncovered, Bluthenthal helped start the Oakland needle exchange program, and ran it for five years while he was a doctoral student. Bluthenthal says that both racial and social inequities he has seen and experienced throughout his life, motivates him to advocate for and aid disadvantaged populations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There's a lot of talent that gets left on the table, because we have a system that discriminates against people, not only because of their race, but also because of their income,&#8221; Bluthenthal says. &#8220;We have a level of inequality that's only grown in my adult life</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and that's a choice. We&#8217;ve ended up accepting diminished life opportunities for people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently serving as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Dean for Social Justice, Vice Chair for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and Professor in the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences and the Institute for Prevention Research at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bluthenthal</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has designed and taught numerous pioneering courses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of his current research includes both qualitative and quantitative research with unhoused people who inject drugs, describing both their material and social circumstances.&#160; Bluthenthal also looks at intensive case management for houseless individuals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bluthenthal has stayed connected to UC Santa Cruz throughout his endeavors, having served on the Alumni Council, the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board of Trustees, and as a generous donor. Bluthenthal will also be a speaker at </span><a href="https://www.ucghi.universityofcalifornia.edu/event/uc-global-health-day-2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Global Health Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hosted at UCSC on May 7.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really do authentically love UC Santa Cruz, and I&#8217;m really proud of the institution,&#8221; Bluthenthal says. &#8220;UCSC has a bright future.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e20d29978072704664be42b4734ff389"><name>svsh-research-spotlight</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Title IX graduate interns shine a light on sexual violence and sexual harassment research</title><summary>Two UC Santa Cruz graduate students are working to showcase campus research focused on  preventing, responding to, and addressing gender-based violence, harassment, and discrimination with a new online spotlight series.</summary><start-date>1649167200000</start-date><display-name>svsh-research-spotlight</display-name><path>/2022/04/svsh-research-spotlight</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/svsh-research-spotlight</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1648764987784</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1649181020087</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Erin Elliott</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/spotlightbanner.png</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/spotlightbanner.png</link><site>news</site><name>spotlightbanner.png</name><display-name>spotlightbanner.png</display-name><file-size>100379</file-size><width>1584</width><height>396</height></image><image-alt>SVSH spotlight banner with blue and yellow geometric designs</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt>SVSH Spotlight Banner Graphic with decorative designs</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Two UC Santa Cruz graduate students are working to showcase campus research focused on&#160; preventing, responding to, and addressing gender-based violence, harassment, and discrimination with a new online spotlight series.<br/><br/>Title IX interns Natali Levin Schwartz and Brenda Gutierrez created the <a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu/campus-research/featured-profile.html">Spotlight on Sexual Violence Sexual Harassment (SVSH) Campus Research</a> as an extension of last year&#8217;s <a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu/about/ccrt1/svsh-folder/svsh-sym-2021.html">2021 Sexual Violence Sexual Harassment Symposium</a> hosted by the UCSC Coordinated Community Review Team and a former Title IX graduate intern, Sona Kaur.&#160;<br/><br/>April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM). Coordinated by the <a href="https://www.nsvrc.org/">National Sexual Violence Resource Center</a>, SAAM is a nationwide campaign to raise awareness about sexual assault and educate individuals and communities about how to prevent sexual violence. This April, as organizations across the country offer numerous programs, initiatives, and events highlighting the impact sexual violence has within our society, two University of California, Santa Cruz graduate students will be working hard to do the same.<br/><br/>The 2021 symposium brought nearly 100 campus community members together in conversation about how to use empirical research to inform best practices for responding to sexual violence and sexual harassment. The <a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu/">Title IX Office</a> plans to host another <a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu/about/ccrt1/svsh-folder/index.html">SVSH Symposium in 2023</a>. In the meantime, Levin Schwartz and Gutierrez created the spotlight to ensure the conversations started in last year&#8217;s symposium carry on uninterrupted.&#160;<br/><br/>Levin Schwartz and Gutierrez said the spotlight is meant to bring awareness to a topic that people often prefer not to consider. Though the work of Title IX has done much to bring greater attention to sexual assault, especially on college campuses, openly discussing sexual violence and sexual harrasment can still be challenging for many.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;We want the spotlight to make people familiar,&#8221; Levin Schwartz explained. &#8220;These are things that are happening. These are the people who are working on this. These are the questions they are asking. These are maybe some of the solutions they are finding in their research. Maybe some of this research could be helpful in thinking about preventative efforts in Title IX, trauma-informed response to survivors, through the CARE office, through the SHOP office, or anything else related to sexual violence and sexual harrassment on campus.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>Published monthly, the spotlight will feature the work of researchers across disciplines and divisions. Both fifth-year doctoral students with research interests in gender-based discrimination, sexual violence, and sexual harassment, Levin Schwartz and Gutierrez did not have to look far to identify the subjects for the first two spotlights: themselves. Levin Schwartz&#8217;s dissertation research, Testimony, Resistance, and Sexual Violence: Towards a Political Theory of Testimony as a Democratic Practice, is April&#8217;s feature. Gutierrez&#8217;s work, Linking Ambivalent Sexism to Violence-Against-Women Attitudes and Behaviors: A Multilevel Meta-Analytic Review, will be featured in May. Come June, they want to shine the light on other researchers in the UC Santa Cruz community.&#160;<br/><br/>Levin Schwartz and Gutierrez are calling for other campus researchers to submit their research to be featured in future spotlights. They want to amplify the work of undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff who are researching issues of sex- and gender-based discrimination, including topics of sexual violence and harassment. Anyone conducting such research should consider submitting their work via the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQEdshRLuT4ogNEcAjuRODW6U6ET-XzYkWfioloddrGETRCQ/viewform">Title IX SVSH Research Spotlight Submission form</a>.<br/><br/>By promoting the work of many across campus, the Title IX graduate interns hope their new platform will also build a bridge between researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. This bridge is essential to promoting collaboration that will improve sexual violence prevention efforts on campus.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;For us, as researchers, who do some more practical work in the Title IX [office], we get to see how important it is to put different worlds in conversation,&#8221; Levin Schwartz said. &#8220;Our work in Title IX is informed by our research, and, at the same time, our work in Title IX crystalizes our thoughts about our own research. This experience made me think about the importance of putting into conversation people who do such important work but oftentimes they don&#8217;t know about each other&#8217;s work.&#8221;<br/><br/>More than benefiting researchers and practitioners, ideally these connections will also facilitate conversations that benefit students and the broader campus community. Gutierrez spoke of the effort&#8217;s potential, &#8220;hopefully this spotlight is the branch and then, from there, multiple things can grow from people&#8217;s collaboration.&#8221; Both Levin Schwarts and Gutierrez get excited thinking about the possibilities that could come from a staff member collaborating with a researcher to better inform and advance their unit&#8217;s effort to address sexual violence and sexual harassment.&#160;<br/><br/>Gutierrez also shared her hopes for the spotlight to create a community of support.<br/><br/>&#8220;As someone who does this work, you can feel very overwhelmed by the state of things,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m reading a paper from the early 90s and thinking these issues are still coming up [today]. Knowing that a lot of other people besides me are doing this work is helpful. There are other people on campus doing this work. It&#8217;s a big network. People care about this issue. I feel like knowing this is a supportive aspect of this work. It&#8217;s important.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e213167c8072704664be42b43c245b14"><name>quarry-summer-concert-series</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Rock on: summer concert series coming to Quarry Amphitheater</title><summary>In partnership with Noise Pop Industries, UC Santa Cruz announces summer concert series to be hosted in the Quarry Amphitheater.</summary><start-date>1649786400000</start-date><path>/2022/04/quarry-summer-concert-series</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/quarry-summer-concert-series</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1648765376110</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1649787622799</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Erin Elliott</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/quarry1.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/quarry1.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>quarry1.jpeg</name><display-name>quarry.jpeg</display-name><file-size>890975</file-size><width>2560</width><height>1707</height></image><image-alt>Quarry Amphitheater</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/quarry-thumbnail.png</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/quarry-thumbnail.png</link><site>news</site><name>quarry-thumbnail.png</name><display-name>quarry-thumbnail.png</display-name><file-size>15834</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Quarry Amphitheater Aerial view</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz and Noise Pop Industries plan to fill the Quarry Amphitheather this summer.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This summer, the Quarry Amphitheater will rock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz, in partnership with Noise Pop Industries, will produce a series of concerts in the university&#8217;s storied, outdoor venue. The musical lineup currently includes two performers across three show dates: Carla Morrison will take the stage on June 24 and Sound Tribe Sector 9 (STS9) will entertain audiences Aug. 12 and 13.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carla Morrison is a Mexican-born singer/songwriter. An anomaly in the regionalized world of indie pop, she sings almost exclusively in Spanish but is beloved around the world for her poignant, tender, love songs. Her alto voice communicates deep emotions in settings ranging from acoustic constructions and elegantly constructed indie rock to atmospheric electronic pop.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">STS9 has been a sonic pioneer for two decades. Using electronic and acoustic means, the instrumental five-piece channels the primordial and celestial, producing a cutting-edge sound that has forged a path for multiple generations of electronic dance music. Seamlessly integrating their exploratory and improvisation-based music with a fully immersive light show, each performance is a transcendent celebration of humanity.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tickets for Carla Morrison and STS9 will go on sale Friday, April 15 at 10 a.m. and can be purchased directly from the </span><a href="https://quarryamphitheater.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quarry Amphitheater&#8217;s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Morrison and STS9 are just a few of the sounds that will fill the Quarry this summer. UC Santa Cruz and Noise Pop Industries plan to announce additional performances soon.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based out of San Francisco, Noise Pop Industries is one of the nation&#8217;s leading independent music promoters. Annually, they produce hundreds of events spanning more than two dozen venues throughout the Bay Area and Northern California. In addition to featuring many early-career performances by artists such as Modest Mouse, The Flaming Lips, The White Stripes, Death Cab for Cutie, they also co-founded Treasure Island Musical Festival and Another Planet entertainment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jose Reyes-Olivias, general manager of Quarry Amphitheater, noted Noise Pop&#8217;s past work as just one of the reasons to be excited about the Quarry&#8217;s upcoming summer, &#8220;Noise Pop&#8217;s connection to independent music and culture felt like a perfect fit to find some great artists to play here.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Noise Pop welcomes the collaboration with UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Noise Pop is honored to present the inaugural public concerts at The Quarry Amphitheater and breathe some new live music life into the greater Santa Cruz region,&#8221; said Noise Pop Industries founder Kevin Arnold. &#8220;We&#8217;re fortunate to have forged a partnership built on a shared vision and passion for the potential of the Quarry with Jose and the UCSC community,&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advent of the 2022 summer concert series marks an important&#8211;and long awaited&#8211;moment for the Quarry Amphitheater. After an $8 million dollar renovation brought the amphitheater back to life in fall 2017, campus officials hoped the space would again become the vibrant gathering ground it once was.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its heyday, the Quarry Amphitheater was central to campus life. Hosting convocations, rallies, and performances, the amphitheater&#8217;s stage welcomed public figures like Angela Davis, Ravi Shankar, Alfred Hitchcock, and Dolores Huerta. Not only did the recent renovation restore the quarry&#8217;s vital role in campus life, it also created an opportunity to establish the quarry as a prominent, local entertainment venue.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Quarry reopened in 2017, the Dean of Students office took over management of the amphitheater and planned to make this vision a reality. Reyes-Olivias explained, &#8220;This has been part of the vision since we re-opened in 2017 and is the result of a lot of hard work by staff across campus. We are really looking forward to welcoming our audiences to this magical open air beauty of a venue.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a general admission capacity of 2700, the Quarry is not only the largest outdoor amphitheater in the Santa Cruz area, it&#8217;s also one of the most uniquely designed. Carved from a former lime quarry, tucked within redwoods and amidst rocky outcroppings, the Quarry&#8217;s asymmetrical terrace design will offer concert-goers breathtaking views in every direction.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garrett Naiman, dean of students and associate vice chancellor for student development and engagement, shared his enthusiasm for the Quarry&#8217;s milestone, &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This effort&#8211;originally planned to be on a larger scale&#8211;was initiated prior to the pandemic. We are really excited to finally see this idea come to fruition and have the Quarry host its first ever public facing summer concert series. We see it as a big moment for the Quarry Amphitheater, for our campus and for our connection to the broader community and region.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last, it&#8217;s time to rock the quarry and let the good times roll.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e62643e68072704664be42b4b2b27468"><name>sanchez-asp-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Biochemist Laura Sanchez wins ASP Matt Suffness Young Investigator Award</title><summary>Laura Sanchez, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry, has been chosen by the American Society of Pharmacognosy as the 2022 winner of the ASP Matt Suffness Young Investigator Award.</summary><start-date>1648796400000</start-date><display-name>Biochemist Laura Sanchez wins ASP Matt Suffness Young Investigator Award</display-name><path>/2022/04/sanchez-asp-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/sanchez-asp-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1648833741781</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648834153987</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/laura-sanchez-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/laura-sanchez-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>laura-sanchez-350.jpg</name><display-name>laura-sanchez-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>84034</file-size><width>350</width><height>459</height></image><image-alt>Laura Sanchez</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/laura-sanchez-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/laura-sanchez-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>laura-sanchez-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>laura-sanchez-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16842</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Laura Sanchez</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Laura Sanchez (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Laura Sanchez, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, has been chosen by the American Society of Pharmacognosy (ASP) as the 2022 winner of the ASP Matt Suffness Young Investigator Award.</p>
<p>The award is given in recognition of the research contributions of early career natural product scientists engaged in multidisciplinary research. In particular, the ASP commended Sanchez for her development of &#8220;powerful tools... for biomedical research using natural products, and commitment to training the next generation of diverse scientists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sanchez studies the chemistry by which cells and microbes communicate with one another or with their surroundings to coordinate biological functions in complex backgrounds. Her lab uses analytical mass spectrometry techniques, such as tandem mass spectrometry and imaging mass spectrometry, to probe and elucidate the molecules involved in communication between cells and microbes in a variety of biological models.</p>
<p>For example, Sanchez is studying the specialized metabolites involved in biofilm formation, which is a contributing factor to virulence and persistence of up to 80% of microbial infections in the human body. Other projects involve ovarian cancer and the microbial communities in cheese rind. Her lab&#8217;s research is very interdisciplinary and encompasses aspects of natural products discovery, mass spectrometry, microbiology, and host biology.</p>
<p>Sanchez earned her B.A. in chemistry at Whitman College and her Ph.D. in chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. She was an associate professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Illinois Chicago before joining the UCSC faculty in 2021.</p>
<p>The Suffness Award will be presented to Sanchez at the 2022 ASP annual meeting to be held in July in Charleston, South Carolina, where she will give a featured award lecture.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e64ef68c8072704664be42b4173f01ce"><name>filipino-history-archive-launch</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Watsonville Filipino history digital archive now available for public viewing</title><summary>The Watsonville is in the Heart Digital Archive is now viewable online and features oral history recordings, original documents, photos, and family artifacts highlighting Filipino history in the Pajaro Valley.&#13;

UC Santa Cruz faculty and students had been collaborating with leaders of Watsonville&#8217;s Filipino community <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/05/manong-generation-oral-history.html">for the past year</a> on the project. The archive is now viewable online and features oral history recordings, original documents, photos, and family artifacts highlighting Filipino history in the Pajaro Valley, starting with the &#8220;Manong generation,&#8221; the first wave of Filipino immigrants who arrived in the 1920s and 1930s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project was initiated by community leader Dioscoro &#8220;Roy&#8221; Recio, Jr., whose parents were descendants of local Manong. Recio noticed a conspicuous lack of inclusion of Filipino narratives in local historical accounts, and he wanted to ensure that the stories of early immigrants weren&#8217;t lost to time. So he started </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">organizing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> community members&#160;through an initiative called <a href="https://www.toberaproject.com/">The Tobera Project</a>, which included a call to share stories and showcase family heirlooms reflecting Filipino heritage.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those efforts grew into a partnership with UC Santa Cruz, and faculty and student researchers from the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Arts Divisions have since been collecting oral histories as part of the McHenry Library&#8217;s special collections and developing a digital archive website with support from the library. The Watsonville is in the Heart Digital Archive is an iterative project and will continue adding stories from the Pajaro Valley Filipino community, but the launch event shared how to view it online and featured pop-up exhibits and interactive kiosks to help guests explore the archive&#8217;s current content.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC team has done a wonderful job,"&#160;Recio said of the archiving work thus far. "They&#8217;ve been very diligent, very professional, and very true to the mission and vision of the project, and they&#8217;ve been working hard to make the archive lively, enchanting, and engaging. We&#8217;re making excellent progress.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch event also featured a panel discussion with three community members&#8212;Juanita Sulay Wilson, Eva Alminiana Monroe, and Antoinette DeOcampo Lechtenberg&#8212;who are key contributors to the digital archive. The discussion highlighted the role that women have played as organizers and cultural carriers in the local Filipino community, as they passed down customs, history, and a sense of pride to their children across generations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, family is a unifying theme throughout the archive materials, which speaks to the strength and resilience of the community. Most members of the Manong generation left the Philippines as single men and were recruited into agricultural work in the Pajaro Valley. Women and children in the Philippines were often legally barred from joining them, and racist laws in California also made it largely illegal for the Manong to marry women they met after arriving in the state. But there are many stories of how love overcame those barriers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The archive contains several testimonies of marriages in neighboring states, like Washington and Arizona, that show how some interracial couples built families. Manong also maintained close ties with family in the Philippines, sending photos and heartfelt correspondence back and forth. In some cases, family members from the Philippines were ultimately able to reunite with loved ones in the Pajaro Valley as immigration policies changed. But for the majority of Manong, who never had children of their own, the tight-knit local Filipino community became their family.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the types of stories that the digital archive shares. Steve McKay, an associate professor of sociology and one of the faculty leaders of the project, said it has been a moving experience for UCSC researchers to work alongside community members on these efforts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are so honored to be able to share such intimate stories that people tell us about their families and that they trust us with that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The families I&#8217;ve talked to have been thankful that there&#8217;s going to be an archive so that their family stories aren&#8217;t lost. That&#8217;s really important, and we feel a lot of responsibility around that. It&#8217;s something that we can give back to them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through sharing perspectives from the community, the archive documents Filipino life in the Pajaro Valley with a depth and richness that&#8217;s currently missing from historical accounts. Most records of early Filipino immigrants in the area focus only on their exploitation as low-wage farm laborers, or on the violence they endured, like the 1930 Anti-Filipino Watsonville Race Riots.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one of the new archive&#8217;s first <a href="https://wiith.ucsc.edu/exhibits">digital exhibits</a>, titled &#8220;More Than Their Labor,&#8221; takes a very different approach by broadening the frame beyond those traumas to show Manong and their families in happy moments of leisure. Christina Ayson Plank, a doctoral candidate in UCSC&#8217;s History of Art &amp; Visual Culture Department&#160;and co-director of the archive, curated the exhibit.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wanted this exhibit to showcase how the Manongs were more than their laboring bodies, and you can actually see from the archives how they moved around when they were just having fun and hanging out, and that shows how they made friends and created community,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is part of how they were building a home in Watsonville.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the archive continues to grow, a K-12 ethnic studies curriculum will also be developed around the archive materials, and the archive collection efforts will culminate in a 2024 exhibit at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History. In the meantime, Kathleen Gutierrez, an assistant professor of history and faculty leader on the archive, said that UCSC members of the project team are looking forward to hearing many more stories from the community and are grateful to Recio for the opportunity to be involved.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Roy&#8217;s energy for this initiative is endless, and I&#8217;m often struck by his commitment,&#8221; Gutierrez said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He drives this work and reminds me of the power of community-engaged projects. It&#8217;s wonderful to see his vision&#8212;and that of other Pajaro Valley community members&#8212;materialize.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e70ad7f18072704664be42b4d731205c"><name>celebrating-ramadan</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title> Information about Ramadan at UCSC</title><summary>This message is intended to provide our campus community with information about observing and celebrating Ramadan. &#13;

<p><strong>Dining Options</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: UCSC Dining Services is now offering the Spring 30 meal plan for students who are observing Ramadan. This meal plan is ideal for 5- or 7-day meal plan holders who would be using the Dining Halls less frequently during this month. Learn about the </span><a href="http://dining.ucsc.edu/spring60/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring 30 meal plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be increased Halal food options at all of the Late Night Dining Halls, as well as access to date palms for students to break their fast with. Learn more about </span><a href="http://dining.ucsc.edu/ramadan/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dining Services offerings during Ramadan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Late Night Dining begins at 8pm. Students may also choose to apply their Spring 30 plan during dinner service (before 8pm). It is important to keep track of your 30 meal swipes as to not exceed your allocated meals during the month. Those with meal plans can request a &#8220;Ramadan breakfast box&#8221; at the dining hall the night before to take out food for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">suhoor</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There will be a variety of items available at breakfast such as hard-boiled eggs, cereal, oatmeal, bagels, yogurt, whole fruit and dates.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Available Spaces for Prayer</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: For individual daily prayers, students may access the reflection center on the first floor of the Bay Tree Building. In addition, the Sentinel Room in the University Center (above the Colleges 9/John Lewis Dining Hall) will be available from 7:00pm to 11:00pm from now until May 2nd. Dates and water will be available outside the room. We ask that participants not access other areas of the facility with the exception of the restrooms.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Testing Accommodations</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><a href="https://registrar.ucsc.edu/soc/final-examinations.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via the UCSC registrar policy website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Given the diversity of religious practice within the campus community, academic and administrative units are encouraged to make reasonable accommodations when the schedule of a required campus event conflicts with an individual&#8217;s religious creed. It is the official policy of the University of California, Santa Cruz, to accommodate, without penalty, requests for alternate test or examination times in cases where the scheduled time for the test or examination violates a student&#8217;s religious creed, unless the request cannot be reasonably accommodated.&#8221;</span></p>

The first working draft of a human genome sequence was assembled on our campus in 2000, which has led to enormous leaps in our collective understanding of human biology and disease.</p>
<p>Crucial regions of the human genome have remained hidden from scientists even after our campus&#8217;s mapping breakthrough two decades ago because of the limitations of DNA-sequencing technologies.</p>
<p>That has now changed. The first truly complete sequence of a human genome &#8212; covering each chromosome from end to end with no gaps and unprecedented accuracy &#8212; <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/t2t-genome.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1648923643970000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0mxMe0O82EAKY6f4Hv4IuG" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/t2t-genome.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">is now available for the whole world to access.</a></p>
<p>Karen Miga, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, and Adam Phillippy of the National Human Genome Research Institute in 2019 organized an international team of scientists &#8212; the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium &#8212; to fill in the missing pieces. Their efforts have paid off.</p>
<p>These newly sequenced parts of the human genome are important to our understanding of how the genome works, genetic diseases, and human diversity and evolution. The new T2T reference genome will complement the standard human reference genome, which had its origins in the publicly funded Human Genome Project and has been continually updated since that first draft in 2000.</p>
<p>The T2T Consortium has now joined with the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, which aims to create a new &#8220;human pangenome reference&#8221; based on the complete genome sequences of 350 individuals. Our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/pangenome-project.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1648923643970000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3z26yENmm88nLxCgvp5Rj0" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/pangenome-project.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Genomics Institute</a> is playing a leading role in this ambitious effort, which will generate and maintain a completely new and comprehensive reference sequence of the human genome that represents human genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Please join us in recognizing this remarkable achievement for UC Santa Cruz &#8212; and for humanity.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC

Physical and Biological Sciences (PBSci) as the recipients of the PBSci Distinguished Alumni Awards.</p>
<p>The division established the awards to honor graduates of the division who have gone on to extraordinary accomplishments in diverse fields and whose careers are characterized by sustained and exemplary contributions to society through research, practice, education, policy, or service.</p>
<h2>Jacob Martinez</h2>
<p>In 2014, Jacob Martinez founded Digital NEST, a technology workforce development hub providing youth in rural communities with high-demand technology skills, mentoring, and hands-on experience so they can secure well-paying jobs. Serving predominantly Latinx youth in Salinas and Watsonville, Digital NEST has connected more than 2,500 vulnerable youth to digital technology, skill-based training programs, and a transformative community of mentors and advocates.</p>
<p>Martinez earned his B.S. in ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC in 2005. Before founding Digital NEST, he spent nearly 10 years running a successful program funded by the National Science Foundation encouraging underrepresented Latina girls to study computer science. The program was instituted throughout the Pajaro Valley Unified School District and eventually expanded to include boys. Martinez received the James Irvine Foundation &#8220;Leadership Award&#8221; in 2020 and was selected as a Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation &#8220;Entrepreneur Fellow&#8221; in 2018. He currently serves on the Board of Directors of Santa Cruz Works and as an external special adviser to UCSC Chancellor Cindy Larive.</p>
<h2>Michael Morgan</h2>
<p>Michael Morgan earned a B.A. in chemistry at UCSC in 1988 and went on to become an extraordinarily impactful high school chemistry teacher and a leader in science education. He taught science at four high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) before joining Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet School, where he now teaches honors and advanced placement chemistry, mentors student teachers, and coaches several extracurricular clubs.</p>
<p>During the past 25 years, Morgan has presented more than 100 workshops for educators and school leaders and has provided in-service training and leadership to new teachers. He participated in a state-wide collaborative effort that resulted in comprehensive standards for science education adopted by the California Department of Education.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Michael has worked closely with the American Chemical Society (ACS) on education issues. In 2020, he was named an ACS Fellow, an extremely rare honor for a high school teacher, and received the ACS James Bryant Conant Award for High School Chemistry Teaching. He also received the 2020 Sal Castro Award for LAUSD teachers who advocate for students and improve the quality of education in minority communities, and he was named a Los Angeles County Teacher of the Year in 2014.</p>
<h2>Risa Wechsler</h2>
<p>Risa Wechsler received her Ph.D. in physics at UCSC in 2001 and is now a professor of physics and of particle physics and astrophysics at Stanford University and director of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC). She is widely recognized for her work on the connection between galaxies and the underlying dark matter halos in which all galaxies reside. She has a vibrant and active research group, and many of her former students are now leaders in the field.</p>
<p>Wechsler has held leadership positions in several major scientific collaborations. She served as spokesperson for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and is a founding member of the Dark Energy Survey and the Rubin Observatory&#8217;s LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration. As director of KIPAC, she has been relentless in working to improve diversity and inclusion within the institute and the Stanford Physics Department. She facilitated development of a strategic plan for equity and inclusion and created a code of conduct for the institute. Wechsler is also a strong voice for public engagement in science and gave a widely-viewed <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/risa_wechsler_the_search_for_dark_matter_and_what_we_ve_found_so_far">TED talk</a> on the search for dark matter in the universe.</p>
<p>The PBSci distinguished alumni will be honored at an awards dinner to be held on Friday, April 22.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f532218b8072704664be42b48ebc7282"><name>usher-covid-tool</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Genomics Institute tool becomes primary method to identify lineages of COVID-19 worldwide</title><summary>As COVID-19 continues to mutate, software developed and maintained at the University of California, Santa Cruzâ€™s Genomics Institute will now be at the core of the primary tool used by health officials worldwide to track the spread of variants in their community.

It is now the default software behind the ubiquitously used tool </span><a href="https://cov-lineages.org/resources/pangolin.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pangolin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, replacing previous software to more accurately assign genomic samples of COVID-19 to a known branch on the virus&#8217;s family tree.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software tool, called </span><a href="https://usher-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UShER.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultrafast Sample Placement on Existing tRees (UShER)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is used to maintain and update a phylogenetic tree &#8211; a diagram of the virus&#8217;s evolution &#8211; of the more than 1,500 lineages that have been identified as mutated from an early genomic sequence from Wuhan, China in late 2019. The majority of all public health organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and the California Department of Public Health will now use this tool on a daily basis. It is a key element in tracking Omicron&#8217;s BA.2 sublineage, which is now the U.S.&#8217;s dominant strain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This lineage system is the primary way we track the virus right now, it&#8217;s the number one thing we&#8217;re looking at to see where it&#8217;s spreading, where it&#8217;s coming from,&#8221; said Russ Corbett-Detig, an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering and co-creator of the tool. &#8220;When new important variants show up, such as Omicron, this Pango-lineage assignment is the way you [track spread] &#8211; so that's the central component of this process.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Using UShER</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a public health official runs a sample of COVID-19 genomic data through UShER, the tool tells them on which branch of the broader phylogenetic tree their samples fit, therefore telling them which lineages of the virus are present in their community. Subtrees are then generated to help officials understand the most closely related genomic samples, which is useful for understanding the virus in a specific population.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tree currently represents about 8.8 million genomic samples of COVID-19, a massive scale never seen before in phylogenetics. UCSC researchers worked to enable UShER to computationally support this unprecedented amount of data, and in real time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All of our work is built on UShER&#8217;s ability to rapidly add a new genome sequence to a very large tree of genome sequences,&#8221; said UCSC Bioinformatics Programmer Angie Hinrichs. &#8220;So at UCSC, we've been maintaining a gigantic tree of all of the SARS-COV-2 genomes, and it's up to 8.8 million genomes and growing &#8211; it's just unprecedented.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinrichs updates the tree daily to include all new genomes shared by researchers worldwide from data repositories such as </span><a href="https://www.gisaid.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GISAID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.insdc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adding new branches for previously unseen mutations of the virus along with many sequences identical to existing branches.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some branches show both new mutations and epidemiological significance, such as appearing in a new geographic location and/or growing faster than other branches. In these instances, the </span><a href="https://www.pango.network/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pango</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lineage curation team may give the branch a name (such as B.1.1.7, which was later designated as the Alpha variant by the World Health Organization) and it can later potentially be identified as a variant of concern by public health agencies like the CDC or the WHO.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPhyloPlace"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UShER</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was crucially used in this way to help identify the contagious Omicron variant responsible for the recent global surge of cases, when a researcher uploaded Omicron sequences to the UShER tree and noticed that they formed a radically diverged new branch.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public health officials can use this information from UShER to trace chains of transmission in superspreader events by comparing the genomic information of samples: if the sequences are similar one person is likely spreading the virus to many and if the sequences are very different, there are probably multiple unrelated infections.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Health officials, and by effect, the public at large, will greatly benefit from this revolutionary method of tracing COVID-19&#8217;s mutations,&#8221; said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;The Genomics Institute continues to be at the forefront of building software essential for the understanding of disease.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Sizing up the software</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UShER was developed in the early days of the pandemic when Corbett-Detig and UC San Diego assistant professor and former Genomics Institute postdoctoral scholar Yatish Turakhia realized the world would need an efficient, scalable way to track COVID-19&#8217;s family history. Along with their collaborators, they created the centralized resource so that anyone around the world can upload data and use the tool for free.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This only works because it is a massively distributed effort where lots and lots of people are sharing genome sequences and contributing to the development of bioinformatics tools to analyze them,&#8221; Corbett-Detig said. &#8220;It's an absolutely amazing thing and I think it&#8217;s exciting to contribute.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, UShER is the default software behind the ubiquitously used tool called Pangolin, which was developed at the University of Edinburgh to determine which lineage of the virus a given genome sequence fits into. Previous versions of Pangolin defaulted to a different software called PangoLEARN, which used machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence algorithm, to do this same work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virological.org/t/sars-cov-2-lineage-assignment-is-more-stable-with-usher/781"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A preprint comparing UShER and PangoLEARN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> posted on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virological</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a discussion forum for the analysis of virus genomes, showed that the UCSC software was much more consistent and accurate at placing genomic samples on the COVID-19 family tree. The results of this comparison prompted the Pangolin team to offer to make UShER the default software in the next major update to the tool.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s been my dream for over a year,&#8221; Hinrichs said. &#8220;I think phylogenetic trees are the way this should be done, and I&#8217;m really grateful that the Pangolin team has been willing to work with us on that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UShER phylogenetic tree is more visually and conceptually interpretable than PangoLEARN&#8217;s machine learning black box, where the algorithm is extremely complicated.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crucially, UShER is more stable in its lineage assignment in that it is less likely to retroactively switch the lineage assignment of samples when updated, something that frequently happened with PangoLEARN.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For [public health officials] obviously it's a big pain point, because if the lineage designation of their samples keep switching then they just don't know how to interpret it,&#8221; Turakhia said. &#8220;That could end up wasting a lot of their valuable hours. So they need to be able to trust the tool, and I definitely feel that [UShER] having stability and being fairly accurate, that should make them more comfortable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the PangoLEARN machine-learning model assigns samples to lineages relatively faster, it is more likely to make mistakes in assigning lineages. So, it is well worth the trade-off in time for the much more precise lineage assignment that UShER offers, said Corbett-Detig, given that this time difference is negligible in the overall process of gathering COVID-19 genomic samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UShER&#8217;s free tree is also used to power other COVID-19 bioinformatics tools like </span><a href="https://cov2tree.org/?protoUrl=%2Fnodelist.pb.gz"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taxonium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cov-spectrum.org/explore/United%20States/AllSamples/Past6M"><span style="font-weight: 400;">covSPECTRUM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allow researchers and public health officials to visualize and understand the virus&#8217;s family tree.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the future, researchers hope to continue to optimize the software to increase the accuracy of lineage assignment, make the software faster, and Turakhia also hopes to see this model be made generalizable to other infectious diseases.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f68260c78072704664be42b49f6b40a8"><name>associate-director-eep</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Rosa Garcia to serve as associate director of Equity &amp; Equal Protection, ADA Officer</title><summary>The Equity &amp; Equal Protection Office is happy to welcome back Rosa Garcia as Associate Director of Equity &amp; Equal Protection, ADA Officer.</summary><start-date>1649055600000</start-date><display-name>Equity and Equal Protection</display-name><path>/2022/04/associate-director-eep</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/associate-director-eep</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1649108213937</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1649109824546</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear UC Santa Cruz Community,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://equity.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity &amp; Equal Protection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Office is happy to welcome back Rosa Garcia as associate director of Equity &amp; Equal Protection, ADA Officer.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On view April 14-August 14, 2022 at the MAH, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strange Weather: From the Collections of Jordan D. Schnitzer and His Family Foundation </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is co-organized by IAS director Dr. Rachel Nelson and UCSC History of Art and Visual Culture Professor Jennifer Gonz&#225;lez and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">explores the relationships and boundaries between bodies and the environment.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strange Weather</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we selected artworks from the Collections of Jordan D. Schnitzer and His Family Foundation with climate change weighing heavily on our minds,&#8221; Dr. Nelson explains. &#8220;While this is certainly not a didactic exhibition, living through wildfires and drought motivated us to explore the impressive collections of over 19,000 objects for the different aesthetic approaches artists use to illuminate the histories, experiences, and socio-political contexts that lead to this moment.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The artworks on view span five decades, from 1970-2020, and are drawn together for how they creatively call attention to the impact and history of forced migrations, industrialization, global capitalism, and trauma on humans and the contemporary landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julie Mehretu&#8217;s three prints, created as a response to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, render abstract an intricate cartography of a rapidly changing climate. Kehinde Wiley&#8217;s large-scale painting, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marechal Floriano Peixoto II</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2009 monumentalizes issues of identity and nature. Wendy Red Star's photographic series, &#8220;Four Seasons,&#8221; links weather patterns to the consumption and commodification of Native American culture.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibition also includes work by such luminaries as Lorna Simpson, Edgar Heap of Birds, Carlos Amorales, Kiki Smith, Leonardo Drew, Joe Feddersen, Alison Saar, and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It has been such a pleasure to work with my colleague Rachel Nelson in selecting works by some extraordinary contemporary artists,&#8221; says Prof. Gonz&#225;lez. &#8220;We are delighted to collaborate with the MAH to bring these works to our students and the Santa Cruz public. The exhibition provides a glimpse of the richness of contemporary art and its capacity to enliven both our understanding of human history and the critical questions facing us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Jordan D. Schnitzer has made it a priority for his collection to be available for education, supporting numerous art museums at universities in Oregon and Washington and making his collection available for other museums and universities to borrow. He and his staff have facilitated more than 180 exhibitions at 160 museums.&#160;<br/>&#8220;I have often said, artists are chroniclers of our time,&#8221; says Schnitzer. &#8220;This exhibition by many of the most important artists of our time references that statement. The voice of art has the power to inspire us! While we are challenged by the themes in this exhibition, it is an exhibition of hope.&#8221;<br/><span></span></p>
<p><span>Concurrent with </span><i><span>Strange Weather</span></i><span>, the Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery at UCSC will feature a capsule exhibition of works by artist Glenn Ligon from the Collections of Jordan D. Schnitzer and His Family Foundation. The capsule exhibition highlights Ligon&#8217;s influential works exploring how constructions of blackness in the U.S. infuse popular culture, literature, and history, from slave narratives to children&#8217;s coloring books.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson has more than 15 years of professional experience in higher-education information technology. She comes to campus from the University of Colorado Boulder, where she is that university&#8217;s first Assistant Vice Provost and Assistant Vice Chancellor for Academic Technology and Student Success. Before that, she held various manager and director positions in CU Boulder&#8217;s Office of Information Technology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson&#8217;s appointment at UCSC, which begins Aug. 1 pending approval of the University of California Office of the President, caps a nationwide recruitment and campuswide stakeholder-engagement process that began in October. University Extension Dean PK Agarwal and Vice Chancellor for University Relations Mark Delos Reyes Davis co-chaired the search advisory committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aisha Jackson is a collaborative and thoughtful leader, and a strong addition to our leadership team,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;I am grateful for the efforts of the search advisory committee and appreciative of everyone in our campus community who shared their insights during the recruitment and stakeholder-engagement process. We leaned deeply on community feedback throughout this process."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson brings to campus a wealth of experience. She got her professional start in information technology at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus, Trinidad and Tobago. She has spent the past dozen years at CU Boulder. Her current position was created to ensure the continued advancement of campus technology in service to both faculty and students. It is a unique role in that it bridges the interdependent domains of academics and administration. The position includes the operational oversight of numerous product and service units. These include academic technology, the student portal, student-success analytics, web and customer relationship management, and an automated administrative platform used in CU Boulder&#8217;s online degrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson said she does not have a preconceived vision of where UCSC&#8217;s Information Technology needs to go, but sees the division as a key player in helping the university reach its goals of improved student success; expanded research impact; a more inclusive campus climate; and better operational efficiency, effectiveness, resilience and sustainability.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need to be in alignment with the campus vision,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;IT needs to be seen as a strategic partner across campus, and we will work hard to be just that.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She described herself as a collaborative leader who empowers staff: &#8220;I believe in humble inquiry and inclusive leadership. I&#8217;m not the expert in everything. I ask a lot of questions. It&#8217;s important to me that we listen to the folks closest to the work. We need to make sure their voices are being heard.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson said she was drawn to UCSC for a number of reasons &#8212; its status as a Research 1 university, its smaller size in relation to the 35,000-student CU Boulder campus, for UCSC&#8217;s shared governance model, and because the campus is designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution that pays special attention to the needs of first-generation students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As an Afro-Latina &#8212; I was born in Panama &#8212; I really connect to the value of supporting Latinx students and students from underrepresented groups,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to me to work at a place that also shares those values.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson holds a doctorate in education from the University of Colorado, Denver; a master&#8217;s in education from the University of Florida, Gainesville; and a bachelor of arts in elementary education from Flagler College in St. Augustine, Fla.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until Jackson begins her appointment, interim Vice Chancellor for Information Technology Byron Walker will continue to serve as the division&#8217;s interim leader, a role he has held since August 2021, when former Vice Chancellor for Information Technology Van Williams was appointed the chief information officer and vice president for information technology services for the University of California system.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="faa053fd8072704664be42b4158025a7"><name>new-vc-it</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Announcing the appointment of Vice Chancellor for Information Technology</title><summary>We are excited to announce that Aisha Jackson will serve as our next Vice Chancellor for Information Technology.

<p>Aisha is a collaborative leader who brings to our campus and leadership team a wealth of experience in higher-education information technology. She is currently the University of Colorado Boulder&#8217;s first-ever Assistant Vice Provost and Assistant Vice Chancellor for Academic Technology and Student Success. Her current position was created to ensure the continued advancement of campus technology to serve both faculty and students. It is a unique role in that it bridges the academic and administrative aspects of the university, with operational oversight of academic technology and student-success analytics as well as some administrative platforms. This experience will be helpful as Aisha continues work already underway to involve our Information Technology division in efforts to achieve our campus goals of advancing student success; elevating our research profile; fostering an inclusive campus climate; and improving the efficiency, effectiveness, resilience, and sustainability of our operations.</p>
<p>Aisha has spent the past dozen years at CU Boulder, working in various director and manager positions in the university&#8217;s Office of Information Technology. She began her career in information technology at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus, Trinidad and Tobago. She earned a doctorate in education from the University of Colorado, Denver; a master&#8217;s in education from the University of Florida, Gainesville; and a bachelor of arts in elementary education from Flagler College in Florida.</p>
<p>I am grateful to interim Vice Chancellor for Information Technology Byron Walker, who has served as interim CIO since August, when former VC-IT Van Williams was named chief information officer and vice president for information technology services for the University of California system. Byron has worked with leadership, faculty, staff and students across campus on how best to leverage technology in ways that support teaching, learning, research and discovery, while also supporting all aspects of campus operations.</p>
<p>I am also grateful to the search advisory committee, chaired by University Extension Dean PK Agarwal and Vice Chancellor for University Relations Mark Delos Reyes Davis, for its work reviewing candidates and providing advice and feedback at every stage of the search process.</p>
<p>Thank you, as well, to the many members of our campus community who provided valuable feedback during the stakeholder-engagement process before we launched the search, then again after meeting with our candidates. The input was exceptionally helpful.</p>
<p>Please join me in welcoming Aisha and congratulating her on joining our campus community!</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cindy Larive </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fafb6aca8072704664be42b4722301b0"><name>indoor-mask-guidance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Indoor mask guidance for staff </title><summary>With the indoor mask mandate lifted, we are leaving it to each individual to decide what works best for them.

<p dir="ltr"><span>I understand why some people may continue to wear a mask and support them.

<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Employees, such as advisors, who do not wish to meet with unmasked individuals:</span></h3>

<p>For this year&#8217;s event, Popova joins forces with Natalie Batalha, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, to explore the marvel and mystery of life, from the creaturely to the cosmic, with stories from the history of science and our search for truth, illustrated with poems about entropy and evolution, trees and mushrooms, consciousness and dark matter, the birth of flowers and the death of stars.</p>
<p>The event will feature the work of poets ranging from Emily Dickinson to Gwendolyn Brooks, performed by a constellation of artists and scientists: Batalha and fellow astronomer <strong>Jill Tarter</strong>, writers <strong>Rebecca Solnit</strong> and <strong>Roxane Gay</strong>, musicians <strong>Zo&#235; Keating</strong> and <strong>Joan As Police Woman</strong>, artists <strong>Debbie Millman</strong> and <strong>Wendy MacNaughton</strong>, poet <strong>Diane Ackerman</strong>, cosmologist and jazz saxophonist <strong>Stephon Alexander</strong>, cognitive scientist and writer <strong>Alexandra Horowitz</strong>, physicist and writer <strong>Alan Lightman</strong>, and <em>On Being</em> creator <strong>Krista Tippett</strong>. There will be live music and stargazing, and some thrilling surprises.</p>
<p>Batalha, who has participated in <em>The Universe in Verse</em> in previous years, is a pioneer in detecting and characterizing planets orbiting other stars (exoplanets) with the goal of understanding where are the most likely cradles of life. She leads the interdisciplinary <a href="https://astrobiology.science.ucsc.edu/?_gl=1%2A1xjcfih%2A_ga%2AMTU5NzA5ODkwMy4xNjQzMDM4NzY3%2A_ga_BWJ4Z4Y66X%2AMTY0OTE3NzI3OS40LjEuMTY0OTE3NzM0Mi4w">Astrobiology Initiative</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>For ticket information, directions, and additional details, please see the <a href="https://astrobiology.science.ucsc.edu/newscenter/events/">event website</a>.</p>
<p>To make <em>The Universe in Verse</em> maximally open to all, tickets are available on a pay-what-you-can basis at three levels. Please contribute the maximum you are able, knowing that it would make the experience possible for someone else of humbler means. All proceeds from the show will benefit The Nature Conservancy and a new scholarship at UCSC honoring the life and legacy of astronomer and search-for-life pioneer Frank Drake.</p>

<p>Coming to UC Santa Cruz immediately after graduating from the University at Albany with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in applied mathematics and computer science, Levine had no idea what he wanted to do for the rest of his life&#8212;a sentiment commonly shared by many 21 year olds.</p>
<p>An avid interest in computer science and engineering research and the desire to be close to Silicon Valley is what led Levine to move across the country to join the Baskin School of Engineering master&#8217;s in computer engineering program. For several years, he worked closely with his faculty mentor J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, distinguished professor of computer science and engineering, to earn a master&#8217;s and doctor&#8217;s degree in computer engineering. Levine explained that his time at UCSC was pivotal.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I credit everything to my advisor J.J. He took a chance on me&#8212;only 21 years old at the time when I first met him&#8212;and for that I am incredibly grateful,&#8221; said Levine. &#8220;I &#160;learned a lifetime's worth of knowledge from him, and the mentorship and encouragement I received during my time as a graduate student made it an easy decision for me to choose academia over industry.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Career niche: Academia</strong></h2>
<p>When Levine graduated from UCSC, many of his peers were accepting job offers from startups in Silicon Valley. The dotcom era presented exciting opportunities for new graduates to join industry; however, Levine was interested in only one career path.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;My time at UCSC inspired me to become a professor. I wanted to try to make at least a fraction of the same impact that J.J. and all the other Baskin Engineering professors had on me.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Choosing academia over industry meant Levine could continue his research in peer-to-peer networking, the transferring and sharing of content across platforms, and help students earn an engineering education so they can go on to make a positive impact in society. The humanistic impact of engineering has always been the most important driving factor for Levine&#8217;s teaching and research.&#160;</p>
<p>Levine joined the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst) in 1999 as an assistant professor of computer science. In 2010, he was elevated to full professor in the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences. He is the founding director of the UMass Amherst Cybersecurity Institute and co-leads the UMass Amherst Rescue Lab.&#160;</p>
<h2><strong>Socially responsible, high-impact research</strong></h2>
<p>Levine researches the security, privacy, and forensics of computer networks. His recent work has focused on thwarting online child exploitation and other topics, including network privacy, mobile networking, and cryptoeconomics.</p>
<p>Levine has observed repeatedly that while new networking technologies such as peer-to-peer networks and mobile apps bring many benefits, they also surface privacy concerns for children. Noting that children are at a much higher risk for being exploited online, Levine focused on how law enforcement addresses crimes against children, specifically crimes involved in the sharing of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Recognizing the lack of available tools to identify perpetrators and prevent child exploitation, Levine and his team of Rescue Lab researchers offered their help.</p>
<p>Levine regularly partners with the FBI and the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force Program to develop tools for network forensics that help in the identification and apprehension of child sexual abuse suspects.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Revictimization is common for victims of child exploitation, leading to life-long trauma and sometimes worse,&#8221; said Levine. &#8220;Our goal is to stop the sharing of content and provide justice to the victims of crime. Many times when law enforcement suspects someone of sharing sexually abusive material, they discover the victim within that residence. This area of research is important in finding ways to thwart these crimes from happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>The digital forensics tools developed by Levine and his team are used nationally and internationally, aiding in the rescue of hundreds of children from sexually abusive situations. Another area of privacy research Levine is currently investigating is the dangers of social networking apps for teenagers. He is working on scientific observational tools capable of deciphering which apps are the most problematic to help educate families and protect the safety and privacy of teen and pre-teen users.</p>
<h2><strong>Honoring a legacy of engineering for good</strong></h2>
<p>Levine has published more than 100 papers and is the recipient of numerous awards, including an NSF CAREER Award (2002), UMass Amherst Spotlight Scholar recognition (2016), and the IEEE Infocom Test of Time Award (2017). He became an ACM fellow in 2020 &#8220;for contributions to network forensics, security, and privacy, and thwarting crimes against children.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>During Alumni Week, Levine will be honored as the 2022 Baskin School of Engineering Distinguished Graduate Student Alumnus, an annual recognition given to one Baskin School of Engineering graduate student alum who has made major contributions to industry or the fields of teaching and research. Levine will be celebrated for his engineering for social good teaching approach and high-impact research.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to UCSC changed my life, and it feels absolutely amazing to be recognized for my efforts since then,&#8221; Levine said.</p>

All incoming slugs are invited to join Summer Edge where students take Session 2 courses before their first fall to fulfill prerequisites or major requirements and build connections with faculty and support resources. They also receive an exclusive 25% discount on per-credit summer tuition.</p>
<p>Starting early can open up time for an internship, research, study abroad, or even graduating early. Financial Aid grants are available for eligible students taking a minimum of seven credits. There are additional savings for out-of-state students because they pay the same tuition rate as California residents over the summer. Last year, almost 600 Edge students completed 4,700 credits online, said Summer Session Director Monica Parikh.</p>
<p>In addition to the academic benefits, Edge students can move to campus this July to live in a residence hall with other newly admitted students. &#8220;We&#8217;re so excited to again offer an on campus experience,&#8221; Parikh said. &#8220;Students not only get an edge on degree requirements and have a lot of fun. Summer is the perfect time to explore UCSC&#8217;s unique location, culture, and community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throughout the program, students receive support through workshops and individual guidance from campuswide staff and Peer Mentors dedicated to their needs. There are also lots of social events where they can make friends before fall!</p>
<p>&#8220;This summer session was my first set of classes at UCSC and they were an amazing experience. I was eager to get started with college and summer session was the perfect bridge between high school and college.&#8221; - Asher Chelder (2021 First Year Edge)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goat herd, on campus until the last week of May, is just one part of a multi-pronged strategy to effectively manage the wildfire risk at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus partners with Cal Fire to conduct prescribed burns and maintain a shaded fuel break along Empire Grade, grazes and mows grasslands, and regularly works to educate members of the campus community about the danger wildfire poses to UCSC and the broader Santa Cruz community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz residential campus is in the wildland urban interface&#8212;the area in which natural landscape transitions into a developed environment. Campus Fire Marshal Nick Otis said it is critical for UC Santa Cruz to create vegetation buffers on campus that can slow down wildfires and reduce the risk of a catastrophic event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 CZU wildfire, which destroyed more than 1,000 homes in the Santa Cruz Mountain and came within a mile of campus, underscored how dangerous and unpredictable wildfires have become because of climate change. It is the eighth most-destructive wildfire in the state's history.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goats will be eating down plants and shrubs as tall as six feet, significantly reducing the ladder fuels that allow a fire to envelop tall trees and grow even more destructive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is a fresh approach to a real campus concern," said Campus Fire Marshal Nick Otis. "I think we'll be able to show real results."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goats will be at the UCSC Farm, the Chadwick Garden, the Quarry Amphitheater, and in some of the ravines with thick brush that are difficult to manage because of the steep topography. Except for bringing the goats to campus in trailers, the effort is free of any carbon emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Goats are invaluable for fire management," said Deputy Fire Marshal Erin Johnson. "They'll eat the vegetation right down to a nub."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goats will not be grazing on the Campus Natural Reserve or other areas with rare plants or on-going research projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goats will be surrounded by a temporary electric fence to protect them from potential predators, such as mountain lions, Otis said. They will also be with a goat herder day and night.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otis said he's already in discussions with other UCSC land managers to see if grazing goats would help with vegetation management.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="055e32fa8072704664be42b4ac9a4281"><name>william-long</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>William Long named 2022 Arts Division Distinguished Graduate Student Alumnus</title><summary>William Longâ€™s (B.A. Music â€™11, M.A. Music â€™13) passion for music began when he was six years old.

The awards ceremony for the 2022 cohort will take place April 23 of Alumni Weekend.</strong><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz alumnus and conductor William Long </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(B.A. Music &#8217;11, M.A. Music &#8217;13)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has had a passion for music since he was six years old. Holding onto that passion through high school and into his years at UCSC, Long now finds himself on international stages conducting both opera and symphony productions for award-winning composers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long has been named UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Arts Division Distinguished Graduate Student Alumnus, an&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">honor given to one graduate student alumnus/a/i per academic division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m honored because I feel that UC Santa Cruz did a lot for me,&#8221; Long said. &#8220;It means a lot to&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be recognized by the university.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from UCSC with a B.A. in Music and an M.A. in Music with a concentration in c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">onducting, Long immediately began his professional career as an Assistant Conductor at San Francisco&#8217;s Opera Parall&#232;le. He prepared productions of Jake Heggie&#8217;s <em>Dead Man Walking</em>, Terence Blanchard&#8217;s <em>Champion</em>, and many more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long said his first step into the professional music industry wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without former UCSC Director of Ensembles Nicole Paiement. A close mentor of Long&#8217;s, Paiement is the Artistic Director of San Francisco&#8217;s Opera Parall&#232;le and landed Long his first job as an assistant conductor in the music industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I learned a lot from watching her and working with her, and then she opened the door for me&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">into the professional world,&#8221; Long said. &#8220;She was basically the springboard for my whole career. I think none of this would have happened without her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After gaining additional experience in San Francisco, Long worked with Washington National&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opera, Opera Theater of St. Louis, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, the Metropolitan Opera and is currently based in London serving as a cover conductor for the London Symphony Orchestra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Long conducted the world premiere of renowned jazz trumpeter and film&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">composer Terence Blanchard&#8217;s opera <em>Fire Shut up in My Bones</em> at Opera Theater Saint&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Conducting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a life changing event for me,&#8221; Long said. &#8220;Not only was it my first time&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading a production at this level, it was also a world premiere of a piece which explored&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">narratives and experiences that are not often represented on the opera stage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long said he didn't get a completed full score until the first day of rehearsal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We continued to&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweak the piece up until opening, cutting scenes, adding new scenes, changing the vocal lines, and changing the orchestration.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a very collaborative effort which is my favorite aspect of making music and the main&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reason why I wanted to become a conductor. I feel honored to have played a&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">part in bringing such an important work of art to life.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Building a passion at an early age</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a child, Long enjoyed television shows and films like Looney Tunes, Star Wars, and Indiana Jones, which caught his attention not by typical means, but for the screenings&#8217; use of classical music in their soundtracks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a fascination with classical music at an early age, Long asked his mother for piano&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lessons when he was six years old. He continued lessons through his school years and joined&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his high school band program in Half Moon Bay, where he grew up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was at a high school jazz band festival hosted at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Music Hall that Long fell in love with the university&#8217;s campus and the music department&#8217;s facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To be honest, UC Santa Cruz wasn&#8217;t even on my radar,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But, after that visit where we played at the recital hall, I saw the view from the music building overlooking Monterey Bay and I thought, &#8216;wow, I actually really want to be here.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For current UCSC music students, Long emphasizes the importance of taking advantage of&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tools made available by the Music Department. As a student, Long participated in the orchestra, opera, and chorus programs and played chamber music, served as an accompanist to the string and woodwind studios and even took voice lessons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of other people also wanting to do what you want to do,&#8221; Long said. &#8220;Part of it is&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just being at the right place at the right time, but you also need to be prepared for when that&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">opportunity arises so that you can embrace it and put your best foot forward. UC Santa Cruz&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">played an instrumental part in preparing me to seize every opportunity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently based in London, Long plans to return to the West Coast in August and will be working on the world premiere of John Adams&#8217; new opera <strong>Antony and Cleopatra</strong>, which will premiere at San Francisco Opera in September of 2022. Long will be unable to attend Alumni Weekend 2022 as he will be working on a production of <strong>Carmen</strong> at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C..</span></i></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="057007908072704664be42b45f53499d"><name>harryette-mullen</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Harryette Mullen named 2022 Humanities Division Distinguished Graduate Student Alumna</title><summary>The Humanities Divisionâ€™s 2022 Distinguished Graduate Student Alumna, Harryette Mullen (M.A. Literature â€™86, Ph.D. Literature â€™90), published her first poetry book Tree Tall Women in 1981 and has since published dozens of poems, stories, books, and essays that have been published worldwide and reprinted in over one hundred anthologies. </summary><start-date>1649361600000</start-date><display-name>harryette-mullen</display-name><path>/2022/04/harryette-mullen</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/harryette-mullen</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1649358669691</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1649358669691</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value><value>Feminist Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Haneen Zain</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/harryettemullenlead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/harryettemullenlead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>harryettemullenlead.jpg</name><display-name>harryettemullenlead.jpg</display-name><file-size>196996</file-size><width>351</width><height>500</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/harryettemullenthumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/harryettemullenthumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>harryettemullenthumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>harryettemullenthumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>20773</file-size><width>56</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harryette Mullen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (M.A. Literature &#8217;86, Ph.D. Literature &#8217;90)&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been named UC Santa Cruz's 2022 Humanities Division Distinguished Graduate Student Alumna.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harryette Mullen</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (M.A. Literature &#8217;86, Ph.D. Literature &#8217;90)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;Established poet, writer, and scholar&#8212;has been named UC Santa Cruz's 2022 Humanities Division Distinguished Graduate Student Alumna.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said faculty at UCSC, as well as the poetry community in Santa Cruz, both impacted and encouraged her work. Late UCSC professors and poets Al Young, Lucille Clifton, and Norman O. Brown profoundly influenced her at the university. She was also befriended by professor emerita Roz Spafford, Cowell Provost John Lynch, and Ph.D. graduate alumna bell hooks. Michael Cowan, Nathaniel Mackey, and Priscilla Shaw supervised her dissertation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I was already a published poet when I got to Santa Cruz," Mullen said. "But I didn't lose my connection to that poet self because UC Santa Cruz allowed me the space to develop intellectually as both a poet and a scholar."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mullen published her first poetry book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tree Tall Women</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1981, written while attending the University of Texas, Austin, where she received her undergraduate degree. She has since published dozens of poems, stories, books, and essays worldwide. Her work has been reprinted in over one hundred anthologies. She is the recipient of dozens of fellowships and has received numerous prestigious awards, such as the PEN Beyond Margins Award, the Elizabeth Agee Prize, the U.S. Artist Fellowship, the Jackson Poetry Prize, and the Academy of American Poets Fellowship. Her book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleeping with the Dictionary,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a finalist for the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Award, and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mullen arrived in Santa Cruz as a student, she had less than $100 to her name and found herself navigating a tumultuous housing market. bell hooks introduced Mullen to Roz Spafford, who rented a garage to Mullen.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While pursuing her Ph.D, Mullen worked in writing programs directed by Spafford; as a TA for professor emerita Michelle Cliff, and as a reader for bell hooks in women&#8217;s studies courses. When bell hooks published her first book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ain&#8217;t I a Woman</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in 1981, Mullen wrote a book review for a local paper at the time, The Santa Cruz Express. In addition to her TA roles, Mullen also worked in graduate admissions, the EOP Summer Bridge Program, and the Women&#8217;s Reentry Writing Program to support herself financially. John Lynch hired her as a graduate resident at Cowell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I was working for a living, and I wanted something related to what I was trying to become&#8212;a teacher, a scholar&#8212;and I wanted to stay close to the university community," Mullen said. "All of those jobs showed me different facets of the university."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her Ph.D. dissertation examined fugitive slave narratives as literary texts focusing on the writings of Frederick Douglass and Harriett Jacobs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"All of that was very exciting; it was not always clear in a Literature Department or an English department at the time that these texts could count as literature," Mullen said. "So I was very excited to write about them not just as historical texts, but also as literary texts."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After earning her M.A. in Literature in 1986, and while writing a dissertation for a Ph.D. in Literature in 1990, Mullen pursued a fellowship with the Center for Black Studies at UC Santa Barbara. From there, she was hired to teach at Cornell University. She spent a year on leave as a Rockefeller Fellow at the University of Rochester&#8217;s Susan B. Anthony Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Mullen serves as a professor of English at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). She has taught numerous creative writing courses and courses in American and African American literature. While a professor at UCLA, Mullen continues to work as a creative artist. She recently published a short story in Indiana Review and a collage art series in Air/Light Magazine. Edinburgh University Press will publish a critical edition of her poetry in fall 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"At UCLA, I am blessed with brilliant colleagues in a department that encourages interdisciplinary study and innovation," Mullen said.</span></p>
<h2>Lifelong learning<strong>&#8212;a family tradition&#160;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harryette Mullen can't remember a time when she wasn't writing poetry. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she was younger, though, her writing came in different forms&#8212;short songs, humorous verses and comic books, stories for friends, greeting cards for holidays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mother was a teacher and had taught Mullen and her sister to read and write before they started attending school in Fort Worth, Texas. While Mullen was between the ages of 8 and 12, her mother was working towards her B.A. and M.A. in education at the University of North Texas. Mullen and her sister would often accompany their mother to the university library while their mother was studying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The university felt like a utopian space,&#8221; Mullen said. &#8220;It was not like the community where we&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lived; it was different. There were precious resources that we did not have in our community,&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">so I think I was drawn to the university as an attainable paradise where books on every subject were available all the time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, Mullen, her sister, and their mother all enrolled at the University of Texas, Austin&#8288;&#8212;their mother was pursuing her Ph.D. while Mullen and her sister were undergraduates.&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Santa Cruz connections&#160;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mullen published her first poetry book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tree Tall Women</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1981 and embarked on a book tour that led her from Texas through New Mexico to California. She read in Berkeley at an event organized by Ishmael Reed, at the L.A. Watts Towers, and in Bookshop Santa Cruz. It wasn't until she was enrolled as a Ph.D. student at UC Santa Cruz that she recognized Santa Cruz as a stop on her book tour.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Pacific Avenue looked like a hippie museum,&#8221; Mullen recalled. &#8220;I suddenly remembered that I&#8217;d been here before, on that poetry tour from Texas to California for my first book.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah Peelo </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ph.D. Anthropology &#8217;09)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been named UC Santa Cruz's Social Sciences Division Distinguished Graduate Alumna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peelo was constantly surrounded by natural and human history at a young age. Her family spent nearly every family vacation at a museum, national park, or heritage site. When she started her undergraduate education at Santa Clara University&#8212;which sits beside a 1777 consecrated Roman Catholic church&#8212;Peelo was once again surrounded by the field she grew up around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peelo graduated from Santa Clara University in 1999 and received her B.A. in combined sciences with a minor in anthropology, and went on to pursue her M.A. in anthropology from Colorado State University in 2002. When it was time for Peelo to pursue her Ph.D., she looked to UC Santa Cruz as an institution beaming with inspirational women in leadership.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was inspired by the fact that all of the senior faculty in the anthropology department were women,&#8221; Peelo said. &#8220;It was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judith [Habicht Mauche], Diane [Gifford-Gonzalez], Adrienne [L. Zihlman], Alison [Galloway], </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and that was inspiring to me. It felt like it was really rare to have the entire faculty that I'd be taking classes from in the anthropology department all women.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peelo is now a woman in leadership herself. She serves as co-owner and president of Albion &#8212;a women-owned cultural resource management and consulting firm in California. In 2017, Peelo and five other women in Albion partnered together to purchase the company's shares from the previous owners moving into retirement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There was an opportunity, and a group of very capable women already here working at Albion stepped up to take on the responsibility and seize that opportunity,&#8221; Peelo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a company president, Peelo oversees projects that impact colonial and postcolonial archaeological sites. Some of Albion's clientele include the City of Santa Cruz, Caltrans, the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, and her alma mater Santa Clara University. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peelo helps clients understand and protect cultural and natural resources that might be on their properties within areas they want to develop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While pursuing her Ph.D. in anthropology at UCSC, Peelo focused on ceramics produced in California missions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She examined the technological style of the pottery from missions to understand its cultural origins and how Native peoples made it their own. Peelo worked closely with Judith Habicht Mauche, a significant factor in Peelo's decision to pursue her Ph.D. at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peelo said that the critical thinking skills she honed at UCSC, along with Habicht Mauche's emphasis on continued learning, still impact her today.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Judith is a world-renowned archaeologist and a very well-known expert in her specialty and her field, but she's very interested in the world and interested in all the things about archaeology,&#8221; Peelo said. &#8220;Her perspective on continued learning in the field, even when you have those degrees, has really influenced me and allowed me to do the job that I'm doing because I am still learning every single day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peelo has taught a number of classes at UCSC since graduating. In particular, she is instrumental in organizing the archeological field methods class, which provides students with hands-on experience in cultural resource management, a skill they can take with them into the professional field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It's been really fulfilling to continue my relationships with the folks at UCSC,&#8221; Peelo said. &#8220;And I hope to continue to do so in the future.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0a5607188072704664be42b4110c8a1a"><name>aasf-30-year-anniversary</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Alumni Week to highlight three decades of alumni-sponsored student support</title><summary>The founders of the Alumni Association Scholarship Fund are using the occasion of its 30th anniversary to increase philanthropic support in the scholarship, setting a goal of raising $100,000 from alumni.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most exciting things about the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association Scholarship is that it comes as a surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike with most scholarships, which require students to fill out applications, the Alumni Association Scholarship is chosen from names provided by the university&#8217;s Financial Aid Office.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the winter holidays, the recipients learn that they will be receiving $3,000 a year for up to four years until they finish their degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I heard about the scholarship, it was a relief,&#8221; said Michelle Pichardo Munoz (College Nine &#8217;22).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Munoz, who is studying applied physics and pure mathematics, said she doesn&#8217;t get family financial support and had to work two to three jobs as a community college student to save enough money to transfer to UC Santa Cruz. She uses the scholarship to help with necessities like groceries and the cost of her commute from her home in San Jose to campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now celebrating its 30</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anniversary, the </span><a href="https://crowdfund.ucsc.edu/project/29511"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Association Scholarship Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has distributed $1.86 million to 788 students since it began. Sixty-five percent have come from historically underrepresented backgrounds. Last year alone, the fund provided scholarships to 41 students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund's 30-year anniversary will be recognized and celebrated at the </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/annual_beer_and_wine_reception"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheers to 30 Years! Alumni Reception &amp; Reunion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during this year's </span><a href="https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, April 19&#8211;24.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven Jung (Stevenson &#8217;78, politics) cofounded the fund with fellow alumni Rob Sawyer (Porter '72, music) and Marnie Bodek (Cowell '74, environmental studies/environmental design), with an initial goal of trying to raise $10,000&#8211;$15,000. They were thrilled to be able to give out a handful of small scholarships that first year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With encouragement from alumni, they decided to keep going.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It slowly took off and began growing and growing,&#8221; Jung said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Jung stepped down from the board and moved on to other endeavors while continuing to donate to the scholarship fund. He recently decided to come back when he saw that donations to the scholarship fund were dropping off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, the fund raised money at in-person student reunions. But during the pandemic, that faded away, and so did many donations. Jung and others started to worry about the future of the scholarship.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thought the fund&#8217;s 30</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anniversary would be a good time to get the excitement going again and increase philanthropic support.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is an important program to revitalize,&#8221; Jung said. &#8220;Every UCSC student is eligible for the scholarship&#8212;not just students from one college or one major. It&#8217;s open to the entire UC Santa Cruz student body based on financial need.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jung hopes more alumni will consider making regular annual donations to the fund. This year, the fund has </span><a href="https://crowdfund.ucsc.edu/project/29511"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set a goal of raising $100,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from alumni.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volunteers from the Alumni Association read over the applications provided by the Financial Aid Office. The volunteers look for students who stand out in four criteria: resilience (ability to overcome difficult circumstances); commitment to service (contributions to community); initiative (leadership qualities); and thirst for knowledge (excitement for educational opportunity).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One student is also selected each year for the Eric Thomas Memorial Award, named in honor of the beloved former Alumni Association president who died suddenly in 2004. Thomas (Oakes '85, economics) was always available to help others, whether that was students, fellow alumni, or others associated with the university. Michelle Pichardo Munoz, mentioned earlier, received the award because of her volunteer tutoring work at her community college.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scholarship winners also get access to a free experiential leadership program put on by the university. It gives the students a chance to develop their professional leadership skills.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corinne Kappeler (Kresge &#8217;11, sociology), the current chair of the Alumni Association Scholarship Fund, decided to help with the endeavor because she appreciated the scholarships she received as a student.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she didn&#8217;t get this particular scholarship, she did receive other aid. The youngest of five children, she was the first in her family to go to college and needed all the financial aid she could get.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I would have been able to attend otherwise,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kappeler, who grew up in Salinas, remembers her joy at learning about the university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was blown away by UC Santa Cruz because of the beauty of the campus, the alternative spirit,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The rich history of building and fostering a community of critical thinkers really spoke to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wants to help other students have that same experience. A nice benefit of helping with the Alumni Association Scholarship Fund is that participating alumni also have the opportunity to serve as mentors to the students. They are encouraged to help scholarship recipients navigate their college careers, offer coaching in speaking and other skills, and more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kappeler said alumni will be impressed when they take the time to learn about the scholarship recipients.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every one of these students is really impressive,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s gratifying that we are able to play a small part in their success.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0b2a0cdc8072704664be42b4431bfe00"><name>sua-gsa-election-notification</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Spring 2022 Campus Elections Announcement</title><summary>The ballot initiative language for the Spring 2022 Campus Elections is now available for review.</summary><start-date>1649746800000</start-date><display-name>SUA and GSA Election Notification</display-name><path>/2022/04/sua-gsa-election-notification</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/sua-gsa-election-notification</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1649454746827</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1649780242544</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>Date: </strong>April 12, 2022</p>

AWS and UCSC are committed to accelerating genomics research by integrating the Dockstore project, a leading repository for scientific and biomedical workflows created in part by Genomics Institute researchers, with the recently released <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/genomics-cli/"><span class="s2">Amazon Genomics Command Line Interface</span></a> (CLI).&#160;</span><span class="s3"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Researchers at the Genomics Institute seek to understand the mechanisms of human disease, and this work typically requires huge quantities of data and processing capabilities. Cloud-based platforms that store and run workflows make it possible to analyze such data, and are equally available to all researchers, independent of wealth and location.</span><span class="s3"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dockstore, a joint development between the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute and the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, acts as an app store for bioinformatics analysis tools and is used by scientists worldwide. It provides a global cloud library of analytical workflows, so that researchers can easily find and use existing analysis tools, facilitating large-scale biomedical research collaborations. Dockstore follows the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR) to promote the reproducibility of complex bioinformatics analyses.</span><span class="s3"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The integration with AWS&#8217;s new open source tool for genomics and life science customers allows rapid deployment and execution of Dockstore-based workflows on Amazon Genomics CLI with a minimum of setup and configuration. In addition to all of the Dockstore-based workflows, the Amazon Genomics CLI natively supports Cromwell, miniWDL, Nextflow, and SnakeMake.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Dockstore's ability to share bioinformatics workflows has already proven critical in federally funded projects such as <a href="https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/"><span class="s2">NHLBI BioData Catalyst</span></a> and <a href="https://anvilproject.org/"><span class="s2">NHGRI AnVIL</span></a> that allow for secure, cloud-based genomics analyses,&#8221; said Benedict Paten, Associate Director of the Genomics Institute and professor in the Department of Biomolecular Engineering at the UCSC Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;We are excited about this new collaboration, as it unlocks an entirely new category of users that can quickly utilize available workflows in the cloud to accelerate their research."</span><span class="s3"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new integration of Dockstore with Amazon Genomics CLI aligns with technical standards set by the <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/"><span class="s2">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health</span></a> (GA4GH), a global organization that ensures common standards across genomics research projects to enable portable genomic analysis and data-driven, life-saving therapeutics faster. These standards include Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that may be used to allow interconnectivity between different computational platforms, overcoming barriers that limit productivity.&#160;</span><span class="s3"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Specifically, the new integration allows Dockstore to execute workflows by using the GA4GH Workflow Execution Service (WES) API. Amazon Genomics CLI provides the WES endpoint that Dockstore utilizes, thereby allowing researchers to efficiently launch analysis on AWS cloud resources with little coding or intervention.&#160;</span><span class="s3"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Amazon Genomics CLI promises to simplify genomics analysis in the cloud,&#8221; said Dr. Taha Kass-Hout, Director of Machine Learning at Amazon Web Services. &#8220;Our new collaboration with UCSC allows quick utilization of existing bioinformatics workflows via the Dockstore repository, and will further enhance the opportunities for computational biologists to rapidly ramp up new research directions while using AWS&#8217;s proven global infrastructure.&#8221;</span><span class="s3"></span></p>

The awards ceremony for the 2022 cohort will take place on April 23 of Alumni Weekend. Risa Wechsler has been named UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Physical and Biological Sciences Distinguished Graduate Student Alumna.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risa Wechsler </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ph.D. Physics&#8217; 01)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has always been interested in the biggest questions of the universe:&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did the universe form? What is it made of? How did it evolve over the last 13.8 billion years? How did structure form in the universe?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those questions stayed with Wechsler throughout her academic career as she pursued an S.B. in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a Ph.D. in physics at UC Santa Cruz. She has since played an instrumental role in groundbreaking research in the cosmology field, with pioneering galaxy structure and cosmic structure surveys&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and more than 300 widely cited publications. Wechsler has also taken strides in ensuring the growth of diversity and inclusion within the physics and astronomy community. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the great privileges of being in this field is that I get to think about these really big questions every day,&#8221; Wechsler said. &#8220;The last 25 years in this field have been incredible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wechsler said that it wasn&#8217;t until she began graduate school at UCSC that she truly dove into the cosmology field. She added that the years 1996-2001, while she was at UCSC, were a fascinating time to be in the cosmology field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While I was in graduate school at Santa Cruz, there was a real revolution in our understanding of this question of what the universe was made of, this question of how much matter is there, and then the question of dark energy,&#8221; Wechsler said. &#8220;A lot of that got pinned down when I was at Santa Cruz, so it was a very exciting time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wechsler&#8217;s research interests are focused on understanding the growth of structure in the universe, how structure formation drives galaxy formation, and how galaxies can be used to probe the fundamental physics of the universe. A majority of her work looks at the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Wechsler uses large computer simulations, physical and empirical models, and the deepest and largest galaxy surveys to determine how the universe formed and evolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At UCSC, Wechsler&#8217;s Ph.D. dissertation, &#8220;Dark Halo Merging and Galaxy Formation,&#8221; focused on creating simulations of the formation of dark matter halos and their implications in the universe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everything in the universe is connected to that dark matter skeleton,&#8221; Wechsler said. &#8220;The evolution of this underlying structure has implications for galaxies on all scales, from the tiniest to the largest. It has implications for understanding how black holes form and merge and how gas gets into galaxies. I love working in this area because understanding how structure evolves in the universe helps us understand how everything in the universe evolves and what it is made of."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She worked with her advisor, UCSC professor Joel Primack, with professors Sandra Faber and former UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal. Wechsler was one of the last students to work with Blumenthal while he was a professor for her first-year project on cosmological models of dark matter halos.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Santa Cruz had the best of both worlds, in terms of being a strong physics department, but also having a really broad and exciting program in astronomy and astrophysics,&#8221; Wechsler said. &#8220;That definitely was one of the things that brought me there and contributed to my lifelong interest in working at the interface of theory and observations.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from UCSC in 2001, Wechsler pursued research fellowships at the University of Michigan and then at the University of Chicago.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 2014 to 2018, she was the co-spokesperson for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (</span><a href="http://desi.lbl.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DESI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and is a founding member of the Dark Energy Survey (</span><a href="http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DES</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and the </span><a href="http://www.lsst-desc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LSST dark energy science collaboration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Wechsler has also played an important role in understanding the smallest galaxies in the Universe and understanding how our home galaxy, the Milky Way is connected to other similar galaxies, including through a project she leads with another former UCSC alumna, Marla Geha, called the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs ( </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SAGA</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wechsler is currently a professor of physics at the </span><a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Stanford University. She is also the director of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC). Committed to public outreach and the advancement of diversity and equity, Wechsler founded an equity and inclusion committee within KIPAC, citing the underrepresentation of women and people of color not only within Stanford, but in the physics and astronomy communities as a whole.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I felt that there was a lot more we could be doing locally,&#8221; Wechsler said. &#8220;Being at a top department like Stanford means that when we do things, it can have a significant impact. The students we graduate often become leaders in the field. So if we&#8217;re able to not only train a more diverse set of students but also cultivate scientists who are thoughtful about how to build inclusive practices into the way we do science, it can have a real impact on the physics community.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">five years, Wechsler said the department saw a 50% increase in the fraction of women that got undergraduate degrees in physics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The universe is for everyone,&#8221; Wechsler said. &#8220;That&#8217;s really what motivates me every day. It&#8217;s such an amazing privilege to get to think about how the universe works and our place in it, and that motivates me to open that opportunity to more people.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="19e0807f8072704664be42b4779518e1"><name>dean-celine-parrenas-shimizu-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Dean Celine ParreÃ±as Shimizu to receive prestigious award</title><summary>The Association for Asian American Studies has selected UC Santa Cruz Division of Arts Dean, Dr. Celine ParreÃ±as Shimizu, for its 2022 Excellence in Mentorship Award.</summary><start-date>1649660400000</start-date><path>/2022/04/dean-celine-parrenas-shimizu-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/dean-celine-parrenas-shimizu-award</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1649701585001</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1651514874911</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>aapi-history</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Nina Sazevich</name><title></title><phone/><email>nina@sazevichpr.com</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/screen-shot-2022-04-11-at-2.25.28-pm.png</path><link>site://news/2022/screen-shot-2022-04-11-at-2.25.28-pm.png</link><site>news</site><name>screen-shot-2022-04-11-at-2.25.28-pm.png</name><display-name>screen-shot-2022-04-11-at-2.25.28-pm.png</display-name><file-size>3959947</file-size><width>1390</width><height>1396</height></image><image-alt>Dean Celine Parrenas Shimizu</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/dean-celine-headshot-thumbnail.png</path><link>site://news/2022/dean-celine-headshot-thumbnail.png</link><site>news</site><name>dean-celine-headshot-thumbnail.png</name><display-name>dean-celine-headshot-thumbnail.png</display-name><file-size>13971</file-size><width>80</width><height>64</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Dean Celine Parrenas Shimizu</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu, film scholar and filmmaker, is Dean of the Division of Arts at the University of California at Santa Cruz. &#160;(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Association for Asian American Studies has selected UC Santa Cruz Division of Arts Dean, Dr. Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu, for its 2022 Excellence in Mentorship Award. Inspired by her work and the great care she has given to the next generation of Asian American Studies scholars and filmmakers, the Association will present the award to Dr. Shimizu at a banquet April 16 as part of its annual conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An accomplished filmmaker and author, and one of the country&#8217;s foremost scholars of Asian American cinema and media studies as well as Asian American gender, sexuality, and feminism, Dr. Shimizu has mentored countless undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, and colleagues in the past two decades, from UC Santa Barbara as Professor of Asian American, Feminist, and Film and Media Studies to San Francisco State University as Director and Professor of the School of Cinema, and to her current position at UCSC as Dean of the Arts and Distinguished Professor of Film and Digital Media, and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anaiis Cisco, Assistant Professor of Film and Media Studies at Smith College and a practicing filmmaker, was Dr. Shimizu's student at SFSU. Cisco says, &#8220;Dr. Shimizu is a sage mentor, modeling the qualities of a compassionate educator and artist. In my time working with her, Dr. Shimizu has motivated and inspired me to strive for opportunities that seemed impossible to land, reminding me of the merit of my creative and professional work. Her guidance has been invaluable, especially during critical moments of navigating entrenched power imbalances within the film industry and academia.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelley Lee, a leading Asian American studies scholar and Chair and Professor of Comparative American Studies at Oberlin College, was a fellow graduate student at Stanford University. Lee states, &#8220;So many of the most powerful lessons I&#8217;ve learned about how to be a dedicated, hardworking professional with an abiding passion for intellectual engagement and equity in higher education come from my many conversations with Dr. Shimizu at all the stages of my career, from graduate school to my current position.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Colorado Doctoral Candidate and soon-to-be Assistant Professor at the University of Miami, Kim Truong-Vu, knew she had to enroll in one of Dr. Shimizu&#8217;s classes at UCSB after hearing her speak at an event. &#8220;She made me feel so included,&#8221; says Truong-Vu. &#8220;I was a first generation college student and wasn&#8217;t sure I belonged. Dr. Shimizu helped me to believe in myself, and also to see that academia, in fact, needed me. Now, I&#8217;m going to be a professor because of her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says Dr. Shimizu, &#8220;It is because of the mentorship I received&#8212;the confidence-building, career-launching, field-breaking advice and the support of programs that enabled underrepresented people to enter the academy&#8212;that I am inspired to create mentorship programs wherever I am, whether as Chair of the Senior Women&#8217;s Council at UCSB, or developing the Equity and Leadership Program to diversify the leadership at SFSU, or the mentoring programs I am prioritizing now for the Arts Division at UCSC. I am so honored to continue this work with my own students and colleagues who nominated me for this award&#8212;work I do for our field and in nurturing an abundance of voices.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Books Dr. Shimizu has authored include </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Proximity of Other Skins</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Oxford, 2020), </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Straitjacket Sexualities</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Stanford, 2012), and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hypersexuality of Race</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Duke, 2007) which won Best Book in Cultural Studies from the Association for Asian American Studies in 2009. She co-edited </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Feminist Porn Book</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (The Feminist Press, 2013) and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unwatchability of Whiteness</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Brill, 2018). Her new book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Movies of Racial Childhoods: Screening Self-Sovereignty in Asian / America</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is forthcoming from Duke University Press.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Celine Archive</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2020), her latest film, won several festival awards and is distributed by Women Make Movies. She is currently working on a new film, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">80 Years Later: On Japanese American Racial Inheritance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which will premiere in May 2022.&#160;</span></p>

Philip Longo, Continuing Lecturer in the Humanities Division&#8217;s Writing Program, and Caitlin Keliiaa, assistant professor in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Feminist Studies Department, will both be receiving awards that will allow them to take leave to continue their scholarly research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel very grateful,&#8221; said Longo. &#8220;It&#8217;s especially surprising because I thought it was very much a long shot as a lecturer, but I&#8217;m really excited to have research support for this project.&#8221; Keliiaa shares her colleague&#8217;s enthusiasm about this award. &#8220;I was thrilled to hear the news,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m very happy to know that it worked out and very excited to be starting this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For over 100 years, the ACLS has been providing support for humanities and interpretive social science scholars around the world. For 2022, the organization will award over $3.7 million to 60 scholars that were chosen from nearly 1,000 applicants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longo will be using his award to further develop his project &#8220;Circles of Sex: The Queer Origins of Sexual Revolution,&#8221; which will explore how queer writers and theorists in America helped set the tone for a period of sexual liberation in the 1960s and &#8217;70s. At the center of Longo&#8217;s research is the life and work of Gavin Arthur, an amateur sexologist and astrologer who was the grandson of former U.S. President Chester A. Arthur. During his life, Gavin Arthur created &#8220;The Circle of Sex,&#8221; a visualization of 12 different sexual orientations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longo first learned about this work via a 1965 article written for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playboy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by one of Arthur&#8217;s friends, Alan Watts. As Longo looked deeper into his history, he was able to follow the evolution of &#8220;The Cirle of Sex&#8221; through mentions of it in early publications for gay and lesbian audiences like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ladder</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> magazine and through a book Arthur wrote for Pan-Graphic Press, the first gay owned-and-operated publishing house in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As I started to track Arthur through this print network, I found that he had an extremely fascinating life,&#8221; said Longo. &#8220;Especially in terms of his relationships with many of the main sexual theorists from the early 20th century all the way to the gay liberation movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Longo argues, many of those relationships Arthur had, and the work he did elucidating his theories in print, soon had an impact far beyond LGBTQIA+ communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A print network emerges where people are starting to write about, name, and offer different conceptions of identity,&#8221; Longo said. &#8220;That&#8217;s taken up by the mainstream press in the U.S. It starts in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playboy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and with its success, you have magazines like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newsweek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ebony</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">LIFE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all start to write articles about the &#8216;Sexual Revolution&#8217;. And they&#8217;re drawing on a lot of the ideas that are being developed in these queer print networks.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Keliiaa, the ACLS Fellowship will allow her to continue work on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsettling Domesticity: Native Women and 20th-Century U.S. Indian Policy in the San Francisco Bay Area</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, her forthcoming book that looks into the Bay Area Outing Program, an exploitative program that sent Indigenous children living in boarding schools into nearby communities to serve as laborers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This program existed from 1918 until about World War II,&#8221; said Keliiaa. &#8220;This program was specifically for Native girls, many of them between the ages of 14 and 19. They all became live-in housemaides through this labor program.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, this Outing Program was meant to help assimilate these young women into so-called civilized society, but in reality, they were being forced into exploitative, and often dangerous, situations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that as a starting point, Keliiaa is using her research and her book to follow threads into the history of domestic labor in the American West. That includes a discussion on how communicable diseases were able to spread through the Native population due to the biased treatment they received at medical clinics in the early 20th century, as well as the larger community that was born out of the shared experiences of those from Indian boarding schools and the Outing Program.</span></p>

Photo courtesy of Michael Stern.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>A unique partnership between The Humanities Institute, a leading national media outlet, and a generous UC Santa Cruz donor amplifies opportunities for UC Santa Cruz students</article-subhead><article-text><p>A unique partnership between The Humanities Institute, a leading national media outlet, and a generous UC Santa Cruz donor is amplifying opportunities for UC Santa Cruz students. The three have joined together to create a paid fellowship for humanities students at The American Prospect, a daily online and bimonthly print American political and public policy magazine.</p>
<p>For Ronald Gunna, the first fellowship recipient, the experience has been nothing short of transformational.</p>
<p>This fellowship is opening up a new realm of life,&#8221; says Gunna, a first-generation college student. &#8220;Academia opened one door, and this is opening a whole new area. Half of success is education and degree&#8212;and the other half is putting it to practice.&#8221;<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Intersection of Values</h3>
<p>The paid fellowship was the inspiration of Michael &#8220;Mike&#8221; Stern, a long-time supporter of The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;The intern program at the Prospect and the ability of UC Santa Cruz to field interns from the humanities is where my two great interests intersect,&#8221; says Stern. &#8220;Many students are being indoctrinated that the only way they&#8217;re going to get a job and do something useful is by doing something in STEM. At UCSC, the message is that the Humanities equip you well, not only as a global citizen, but as someone who can get a good job. Those are the things that the university is working on, and that aligns with my values as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that civic accountability journalism is at the forefront of his pursuits, and that The Prospect is one of only a handful of policy journalism outlets out there.</p>
<p>Stern&#8217;s ties to The American Prospect go back to his college days, when he attended Columbia with one of the magazine&#8217;s co-founders, Paul Starr. He and Starr were roommates and fellow editors of the university&#8217;s student newspaper, The Spectator. Stern has served on The Prospect&#8217;s board of directors for many years.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Prospect is something unique, which is reported policy journalism,&#8221; Stern says. &#8220;It tries to explain how policy choices affect people&#8217;s daily lives not through scholarly or more academically oriented research but by doing deeply reported stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>The American Prospect internship has been made permanently virtual as a result of the pandemic, making it more equitable and accessible&#8212;a student doesn&#8217;t have to incur the expense of relocating in order to participate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a way to diversify the internship and contributors to the magazine both economically and geographically,&#8221; Stern says. &#8220;It means that not everyone needs to come from an elite Eastern university in order to be an intern.&#8221;<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Future Investment</h3>
<p>Stern recognized that the magazine could offer a life-changing experience for a UCSC student through a paid, virtual fellowship. By funding the internship for the next few years, Stern is investing in the future of Humanities undergraduates.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of The Prospect&#8217;s major contributions to journalism is to train future journalists. By having students have access to internships there&#8212;then see that all the things they&#8217;ve learned how to do in school like how to think critically, how to read critically, how to do research&#8212; can bear fruit in a real job,&#8221; Stern says.<br/>Gunna agreed, saying the fellowship appealed to him because of the opportunity it offered him to learn outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;At school we learn the theory, the academic work, the structure. But once you leave, what do you do with it? How do you apply it&#8212;and make an actual difference? I&#8217;m getting that now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gunna participates in staff meetings, facilitated by The American Prospect&#8217;s executive editor David Dayen, alongside the magazine&#8217;s editors, writers, and other interns and feels free to participate on an equal footing with everyone.</p>
<p>Gunna is in good company. The American Prospect&#8217;s fellowship program enables young writers to develop their skills under an intensive mentoring program that is widely regarded as one of the foremost springboards to fulfilling and impactful careers. Alumni of its internship and writing fellows programs include Bernie Sanders's adviser Matt Duss; Shera Avi-Yonah, a Harvard Crimson editor who was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship for 2021; Ezra Klein, who also attended UC Santa Cruz 2002-2004; Matt Yglesias; Jamelle Bouie; Adam Serwer; Pulitzer Prize winner Chris Mooney; Joshua Micah Marshall; Dana Goldstein; Nicholas Confessore; and Kate Sheppard.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Close Connections</h3>
<p>Stern was inspired to create the paid fellowship for UC Santa Cruz students because the Prospect offers students a great mentorship opportunity and connection to journalists and professionals.<br/><br/>But not only is Stern creating mentorship opportunities for Gunna and the future American Prospect/UCSC interns that he has committed to funding, he is serving as a mentor for Gunna directly. Stern and Gunna connect on a regular basis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve really seen him gain confidence,&#8221; Stern says. &#8220;It&#8217;s expanding his ability to see the big picture. He is getting a sense of how that perspective translates to being able to think and write about the issues that face us. I&#8217;ve seen him grow in his ability to put classroom theory to work in a professional setting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gunna is grateful&#8212;not only to have been selected for the fellowship but for Stern&#8217;s personal interest in him.<br/>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t someone who just handed money to the school. This is an individual who cares about students like me and creating opportunities for my success,&#8221; Gunna says. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty humbling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a whole lot of adults with whom I can check in with about the work that I&#8217;m doing, so it&#8217;s really great to have someone to share this with. I come from a family where just getting into university is a huge deal in and of itself. It&#8217;s nice to have someone to talk to who understands some of the more nuanced elements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gunna is a Santa Cruz local, the oldest of four boys raised by a single mom. His path to UC Santa Cruz wasn&#8217;t traditional. After high school he attended Cabrillo College, the local community college, and then took some time to travel, live, and work in other areas of the country. Now 29, he is nearly a decade older than many of the other students on campus. He says his unique experience provides perspective and balance.</p>
<p>He encourages other students to take advantage of all that UC Santa Cruz has to offer.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s so much opportunity here at the university,&#8221; Gunna says. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just to come and get a degree and go home. It&#8217;s about opening up your mind and a whole different world. This is just the beginning.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1f85e4e88072704664be42b43975dc02"><name>unlawful-entry</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Seeking assistance with Unlawful Entry of Occupied Dwelling</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is seeking the communityâ€™s help in the investigation of a crime that occurred early Monday, April 11.</summary><start-date>1649746800000</start-date><display-name>Seeking assistance with Unlawful Entry of Occupied Dwelling</display-name><path>/2022/04/unlawful-entry</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/unlawful-entry</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1649796310226</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1649796310226</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is seeking the community&#8217;s help in the investigation of a crime that occurred early Monday, April 11.</span><br/><span>&#160;</span><br/><span>Between approximately 3 and 4 a.m, a man entered an occupied room in a residence hall at College Ten while the occupants were asleep.

A graduate student in the <a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/">Coastal Science &amp; Policy Program</a> at UC Santa Cruz, Paz-Lacavex leads a multidisciplinary effort to deploy an innovative kelp restoration technique called &#8220;green gravel&#8221; in Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>Her project&#8212;&#8220;Socioecology, Planning, and Optimal Restoration of Algae,&#8221; or SPORA&#8212;is among five national finalists in the 2022 Blackstone LaunchPad Pitch Competition. The finalists gave live pitches at the Startup Grind Global Conference in Silicon Valley on April 12. SPORA, the only startup in the competition with an environmental focus, received $2,500 in funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Blackstone platform helped me develop the idea for SPORA as an entity that can advance kelp restoration,&#8221; Paz-Lacavex said. &#8220;I&#8217;m proud that it has moved forward to be recognized by Blackstone LaunchPad as a technology solution that can really have an impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>To make green gravel, her team settles microscopic kelp spores onto small rocks or gravel to get juvenile kelp plants growing in the lab, attached securely to the rocks. The gravel can then be scattered from a boat over a rocky reef, and the juvenile kelp plants can eventually grow beyond the gravel and become attached to the natural reef.</p>
<p>The green gravel technique was developed by scientists at the Institute for Marine Research in Norway and the University of Western Australia, who used it to restore sugar kelp <em>(Saccharina latissima)</em> in Norway. Paz-Lacavex is adapting their technique for giant kelp <em>(Macrocystis pyrifera)</em>, which is a dominant kelp species along the California coast. SPORA is now part of a global consortium, the <a href="https://www.greengravel.org/">Green Gravel Action Group</a>, working to implement green gravel techniques around the world.</p>
<p>Last summer, Paz-Lacavex worked with researchers at UC Irvine on a green gravel project led by microbiologist Joleah Lamb. She continues to collaborate with Lamb&#8217;s lab to develop protocols for culturing giant kelp in the laboratory.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goal is to test the concept of green gravel alongside fishing communities in need of kelp restoration,&#8221; Paz-Lacavex said. &#8220;Kelp forest ecosystems provide important habitat for many of the species these communities depend on, including fish, abalone, lobster, and urchins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paz-Lacavex grew up in Ensenada in Baja California, where she earned a B.S. in environmental sciences and a specialty degree in environmental management at Universidad Aut&#243;noma de Baja California (UABC).</p>
<p>SPORA&#8217;s partners include scientists at UABC and at The Nature Conservancy. Paz-Lacavex is using laboratory space at UABC&#8217;s Marine Botany Lab, where she is working with phycologists Jose Zertuche and Jose Miguel Sandoval-Gil. She is also working with marine scientists in UABC&#8217;s <a href="https://mex-cal.org/">MexCal</a> coastal ecosystem research consortium (Rodrigo Beas and Julio Lorda).</p>
<p>&#8220;The cool thing about working in Baja is the opportunity to work with the fishing cooperatives that manage the fisheries in their territory,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Local collaboration is key to ensuring the success of any restoration project, so we are involving the community from the start.&#8221;</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, her advisers are Mark Carr and Peter Raimondi, both professors of ecology and evolutionary biology with expertise in kelp forest ecology and coastal ecosystem management.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first time I dove in a kelp forest was with Mark, and I knew then that I wanted to do something to protect this ecosystem,&#8221; Paz-Lacavex said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve really helped me keep this project moving in the right direction as I&#8217;ve encountered challenges along the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said SPORA has the potential to offer green gravel to fishery cooperatives, government agencies trying to improve ecosystem health and social resilience in the face of climate change, as well as to companies that aim to develop sustainable sources of kelp for use in industries such as agriculture, cosmetology, and pharmaceuticals.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="290fa5978072704664be42b4d3e9a150"><name>li-hellman-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Statistics professor wins Hellman fellowship to rethink verbal autopsy survey design</title><summary>Assistant professor of statistics Richard Li will use his Hellman award to rethink survey design for verbal autopsy, the process of determining cause of death outside of the hospital which is routinely implemented in many low- and middle-income countries throughout the world.</summary><start-date>1649919600000</start-date><path>/2022/04/li-hellman-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/li-hellman-award</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1649956332928</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1649956332928</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Applied Mathematics and Statistics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/zehang_richard_li_350.png</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/zehang_richard_li_350.png</link><site>news</site><name>zehang_richard_li_350.png</name><display-name>zehang_richard_li_350.png</display-name><file-size>173122</file-size><width>350</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt>Richard Li</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/zehang_richard_li_80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/zehang_richard_li_80.png</link><site>news</site><name>zehang_richard_li_80.png</name><display-name>zehang_richard_li_80.png</display-name><file-size>13834</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Richard Li</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Richard Li aims to design an adaptive survey for verbal autopsy with the support of a Hellman fellowship.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="p1"><span class="s1">In many low- and middle-income countries throughout the world, when someone dies, a local health official comes to the home and asks the family members of the deceased a long list of questions: whether the person had a cough, a fever, a previous diagnosis, and much more. This process, called verbal autopsy, is the main way health officials determine cause of death amongst their populations after statisticians use algorithms to evaluate survey responses to assign a cause, and it has downstream effects on monitoring population health and designing interventions.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the lengthy, 200-300 question survey can be emotionally burdensome for both the interviewer and the relatives of the deceased person, and is known to be the biggest ongoing problem in this field. That&#8217;s why Zehang &#8220;Richard&#8221; Li, assistant professor of statistics at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Baskin School of Engineering, wants to entirely redesign the process of data collection in verbal autopsy. With the support of the <a href="https://academicaffairs.ucsc.edu/hellman/index.html">UCSC Hellman fellowship</a> behind him, an award to support the research of promising assistant professors, Li aims to create an adaptive survey design model for verbal autopsy that would generate new questions based on previous responses to gather the most accurate information and reduce overall survey time.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;What we are trying to do in this project is to rethink this whole process and have a dynamic survey design that could eventually be used in the field, where potentially if you ask the first question like whether or not the person was hit by a car and the answer is &#8216;yes,&#8217; you can can stop,&#8221; Li said. &#8220;Potentially we don&#8217;t need to go through all the questions. It would be a brand new type of data collection&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adaptive survey design is a concept already being used in a variety of fields, from Facebook surveys to Buzzfeed quizzes that guess your celebrity crush. Li believes that now is the right time to bring adaptive surveys into the practice of verbal autopsy, which has been the subject of his research since graduate school, because the infrastructure of internet and tablets needed to carry out an adaptive survey is now in place in many parts of Africa, Latin America, and southeast Asia where verbal autopsy is routinely implemented.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Li and graduate student collaborator Toshiya Yoshida, with the input of collaborators from the <a href="https://openva.net/"><span class="s2">openVA</span></a> team, a multi-university research group focusing on verbal autopsy methods and software, will work to come up with a set of recommendations for these adaptive surveys and guidance for different situations that could arise. They aim to create user-friendly software for adaptive verbal autopsy surveys that interviewers can use in relatively easy and painless fashion in the field.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While a pilot study of this software will be logistically challenging, Li hopes his team can execute one to show that this idea can work not just in theory but in practice, and evaluate the performance of the software his team creates.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Previous attempts to shorten these lengthy surveys meant researchers had to try to determine which questions could be cut with minimal impact on assessing cause of death at the population level. But Li said these decisions introduce inherent bias in the surveys, unlike an adaptive survey, which is tailored and precise to the individual.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By working closely with and learning from practitioners and interviewers in the field, Li aims to connect statisticians back to data collection and the actual people whom their work impacts. In the long term, Li hopes that this work can help integrate the entire verbal autopsy ecosystem by bringing the initial data collection into the fold, and ultimately make the process easier for everyone involved.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We know that by asking fewer questions we make things easier for the people that are being interviewed, and potentially make this whole process more accepted by people if they know they don&#8217;t have to sit there for hours and go through all the details of the death of their relative,&#8221; Li said. &#8220;It's the same application I've been working on for a long time, but it's taking a different part of the problem that I think is meaningful. We've been looking at how to estimate mortality better and better, but I think we should focus on how to make it easier for people to actually go through the process.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2a8596388072704664be42b400b7a976"><name>sharia-inshallah-global-acclaim</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Politics professorâ€™s book challenging Western notions of Sharia wins global acclaim</title><summary>In the past year, Politics and Legal Studies Professor Mark Fathi Massoud's latest book has earned him a series of award recognitions, speaking engagements around the globe, and an invitation to a closed session with resident representatives of the United Nations Development Program.&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud&#8217;s book, </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/05/sharia-human-rights.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, traces Somalia&#8217;s history and contemporary politics to reveal how Sharia&#8212;a system of Islamic religious rules often portrayed as a tool of extremism or oppression&#8212;can advance human rights and promote the rule of law.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the book shares stories of Somali women&#8217;s rights activists who are teaching how gender equality is compatible with the principles of Islam. These activists have found that appeals through the lens of Sharia are more effective than those that emphasize legal rights under international law. Massoud </span><a href="https://theconversation.com/muslim-women-are-using-sharia-to-push-for-gender-equality-158371"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has argued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this indicates that international advocacy organizations will need to understand and acknowledge the role of Islam in order to support human rights efforts in Somalia and other Muslim-majority nations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many Somali women have actually been fighting religious fundamentalism not by demanding religion stay out of politics but by promoting religious interpretations of women's rights, and they do this because they know that religion is so essential to people's lived experiences,&#8221; Massoud said. &#8220;And in countries that experienced European colonialism, many people see legal conceptions like human rights as just another Western imposition, but religious interpretations of social justice resonate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud shared findings from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shari&#8216;a, Inshallah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the rule of law and gender with senior officials, known as resident representatives, of the United Nations Development Program at a meeting last month. The closed session was organized in connection with </span><a href="https://genderatwork.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gender at Work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a global feminist network that is working to end discrimination against women.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, on April 7, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shari&#8216;a, Inshallah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was also awarded the </span><a href="https://slsa.ac.uk/index.php/prizewinners#Hart2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 Hart-SLSA Book Prize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Socio-Legal Studies Association, which recognizes the year&#8217;s top book in the field. And in January, Massoud&#8217;s book was honored as a finalist for the </span><a href="https://publishers.org/news/association-of-american-publishers-announces-finalists-and-category-winners-for-2022-prose-awards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Association of Publishers PROSE Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the best book on government &amp; politics published in 2021.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud says the book&#8217;s example of how religion and politics entwine in East Africa holds lessons for other regions of the globe. In particular, he argues that religious moral authority often helps to establish rule of law, which has historically laid the path for many of today&#8217;s democracies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the things I hope people see in the book is that the rule of law&#8212;this concept that is so fundamental to ensuring thriving democracies&#8212;has its roots in religion,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Even today, religious faith is very much a part of the underlying politics in America and Somalia alike, and people invoke religious faith for all kinds of politics, from conservative to progressive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud will discuss these themes from the book and more during a series of four hybrid lectures this May for the University of Oxford. He was selected to give Oxford&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.asc.ox.ac.uk/event-series/evans-pritchard-lectures-2022-legal-politics-religion-building-islamic-rule-law-horn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evans-Pritchard Lectures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will take place on May 10, 17, 25, and 31 and will be open to the public virtually.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Massoud said the widespread interest in and appreciation for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shari&#8216;a, Inshallah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been an uplifting and emotional experience for him.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel so much gratitude for all of the people who supported me through the process of developing this book, and seeing this kind of recognition has just made all of that come flooding in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really special to have this validation from others, but ultimately, the biggest reward is the opportunity through this book to share something meaningful with the world about the powers of faith and law.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2e3734aa8072704664be42b426e81d05"><name>distinguished-graduate-alumni</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Honoring UC Santa Cruzâ€™s 2022 Distinguished Graduate Student Alumni </title><summary>Each year, UC Santa Cruzâ€™s five academic divisions select one graduate student alumnus/a/i as their Distinguished Graduate Student Alumni honoree.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The 2022 class of UC Santa Cruz Distinguished Graduate Student Alumni continue to strengthen the reputation of the university&#8217;s graduate programs,&#8221; Newlyn said. &#8220;Representing music in the Arts, computer engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering, literature in the Humanities, physics in the Physical and Biological Sciences, and anthropology in the Social Sciences, this year&#8217;s honorees have reached lofty positions in their careers. While three have pursued careers within academia and another continues to teach at UCSC while heading a private business, all five honorees extend their influential knowledge and creativity well beyond the Academy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are all a force for human good and betterment, from the artistic endeavors of music and poetry to the science of preserving natural resources and our cultural heritage, protecting our children from predators on the Internet, and understanding the universe itself,&#8221; Newlyn added. &#8220;Congratulations to William Long, Brian Levine, Harryette Mullen, Sarah Peelo, and Risa Wechsler!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz alumnus and conductor </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/04/william-long.html"><strong>William Long</strong></a> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(B.A. Music &#8217;11, M.A. Music&#8217; 13)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has had a passion for music since he was six years old. Holding onto that passion through high school and into his years at UCSC, Long now finds himself on international stages conducting both opera and symphony productions for award-winning composers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from UCSC with a B.A. in music and an M.A. in music with a concentration in conducting, Long immediately began his professional career as an assistant conductor at San Francisco&#8217;s Opera Parall&#232;le. He prepared productions of Jake Heggie&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dead Man Walking</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Terence Blanchard&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Champion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and many more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long said his first step into the professional music industry wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without former UCSC Director of Ensembles Nicole Paiement. A close mentor of Long&#8217;s, Paiement is the Artistic Director of San Francisco&#8217;s Opera Parall&#232;le and landed Long his first job as an assistant conductor in the music industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I learned a lot from watching her and working with her, and then she opened the door for me into the professional world,&#8221; Long said. &#8220;She was basically the springboard for my whole career. I think none of this would have happened without her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After gaining additional experience in San Francisco, Long worked with the Washington National Opera, the Opera Theater of St. Louis, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, and the Metropolitan Opera and is currently based in London serving as a cover conductor for the London Symphony Orchestra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Long conducted the world premiere of renowned jazz trumpeter and film composer Terence Blanchard&#8217;s opera </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Shut up in My Bones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Opera Theater Saint Louis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Conducting Fire was a life-changing event for me,&#8221; Long said. &#8220;Not only was it my first time leading a production at this level, but it was also a world premiere of a piece which explored narratives and experiences that are not often represented on the opera stage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently based in London, Long plans to return to the West Coast in August and will be working on the world premiere of John Adams&#8217; new opera Antony and Cleopatra, which will premiere at San Francisco Opera in September of 2022. Long will be unable to attend Alumni Weekend 2022 as he will be working on a production of Carmen at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.</span></i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/04/brian-levine.html"><strong>Brian Levine</strong></a> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(M.S. Computer Engineering &#8217;96, Ph.D. Computer Engineering&#8217; 99)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remembers his time at Baskin Engineering as a pivotal and life-changing moment in his career.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the mentorship of UC Santa Cruz professor of computer science and engineering, J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, Levine pursued his master&#8217;s and doctorate degrees. His thesis focused on group communication over the internet. Levine said that his relationship with Garcia-Luna-Aceves profoundly influenced his career path and inspired him to become a professor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a professor, he is filled with kindness, patience, and great ideas,&#8221; Levine said. &#8220;I try to replicate that in any way I can at UMass, and he just made it seem like a great job, and it is. It&#8217;s really great to be a professor, and so if I hadn&#8217;t met JJ, I don&#8217;t know what my life would be like now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levine currently works as a professor in the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst and co-leads the Rescue Lab. There, Levine and his team focus on thwarting crimes against children. His&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital forensics work has aided in the rescue by law enforcement of hundreds of children from sexually abusive situations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levine's recent work has focused on thwarting online child exploitation. Levine has partnered with the FBI and the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force Program on several projects to develop networking tools that help identify online sexual predators and rescue victims. The tools he and his team have developed are used nationally and worldwide.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levine is also the founding director of the UMass Amherst Cybersecurity Institute, which focuses on coordinating educational programs surrounding security. Levine said that one of his goals is to inform parents of the dangers of specific web applications that target children and teens.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s really not enough information about which apps are safer, and definitely not information based on observations,&#8221; Levine said. &#8220;And so we&#8217;re trying to educate parents and children.&#8221;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/04/harryette-mullen.html"><strong>Harryette Mullen</strong></a> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(M.A. Literature &#8217;86, Ph.D. Literature&#8217; 90)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can&#8217;t remember a time when she wasn&#8217;t writing poetry. When she was younger, though, her writing came in different forms&#8212;short songs, humorous verses and comic books, stories for friends, and greeting cards for holidays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mother was a teacher and had taught Mullen and her sister to read and write before they started attending school in Fort Worth, Texas. While Mullen was between the ages of 8 and 12, her mother was working towards her B.A. and M.A. in education at the University of North Texas. Mullen and her sister would often accompany their mother to the university library while their mother was studying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mullen published her first poetry book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tree Tall Women</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1981, written while attending the University of Texas, Austin, where she received her undergraduate degree. She has since published dozens of poems, stories, books, and essays worldwide. Her work has been reprinted in over one hundred anthologies. She is the recipient of dozens of fellowships and has received numerous prestigious awards, such as the PEN Beyond Margins Award, the Elizabeth Agee Prize, US Artist Fellowship, Jackson Poetry Prize, and Academy of American Poets Fellowship. Her book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleeping with the Dictionary</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was a finalist for the National Book Award, National Book Critics Award, and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said faculty at UCSC, as well as the poetry community in Santa Cruz, both impacted and encouraged her work. Late UCSC professors and poets Al Young, Lucille Clifton, and Norman O. Brown profoundly influenced her at the university. She was also befriended by professor emerita Roz Spafford, Cowell Provost John Lynch, and Ph.D. graduate alumna bell hooks. Michael Cowan, Nathaniel Mackey, and Priscilla Shaw supervised her dissertation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was already a published poet when I got to Santa Cruz,&#8221; Mullen said. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t lose my connection to that poet self because UC Santa Cruz allowed me the space to develop intellectually as both a poet and a scholar.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After earning her M.A. in literature in 1986 and while writing a dissertation for a Ph.D. in literature in 1990, Mullen pursued a fellowship with the Center for Black Studies at UC Santa Barbara. From there, she was hired to teach at Cornell University. She spent a year on leave as a Rockefeller Fellow at the University of Rochester&#8217;s Susan B. Anthony Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Mullen serves as a professor of English at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). She has taught numerous creative writing courses and courses in American and African American literature. While a professor at UCLA, Mullen continues to work as a creative artist. She recently published a short story in Indiana Review and a collage art series in Air/Light Magazine. Edinburgh University Press will publish a critical edition of her poetry in fall 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At UCLA, I am blessed with brilliant colleagues in a department that encourages interdisciplinary study and innovation,&#8221; Mullen said.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/04/sarah-peelo.html"><strong>Sarah Peelo</strong></a> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ph.D. Anthropology&#8217; 09)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was constantly surrounded by natural and human history at a young age. Her family spent nearly every family vacation at a museum, national park, or heritage site. When she started her undergraduate education at Santa Clara University&#8212;which sits beside a 1777 consecrated Roman Catholic church&#8212;Peelo was once again surrounded by the field she grew up around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peelo graduated from Santa Clara University in 1999 and received her B.A. in combined sciences with a minor in anthropology. She pursued her M.A. in anthropology from Colorado State University in 2002. When it was time for Peelo to pursue her Ph.D., she looked to UC Santa Cruz as an institution beaming with inspirational women in leadership.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was inspired by the fact that all of the senior faculty in the anthropology department were women,&#8221; Peelo said. "It was Judith [Habicht Mauche], Diane [Gifford-Gonzalez], Adrienne [L. Zihlman], Alison [Galloway], and that was inspiring to me. It felt like it was really rare to have the entire faculty that I&#8217;d be taking classes from in the anthropology department all women.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peelo is now a woman in leadership herself. She serves as co-owner and president of </span><a href="https://www.albionenvironmental.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Albion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;a women-owned cultural resource management and consulting firm in California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a company president, Peelo oversees projects that impact colonial and postcolonial archaeological sites. Some of Albion&#8217;s clientele include the City of Santa Cruz, Caltrans, the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, and her alma mater Santa Clara University. Peelo helps clients understand and protect cultural and natural resources that might be on their properties within areas they want to develop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While pursuing her Ph.D. in anthropology at UCSC, Peelo focused on ceramics produced in California missions. She examined the technological style of the pottery from missions to understand its cultural origins and how Native peoples made it their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peelo has taught a number of classes at UCSC since graduating. In particular, she is instrumental in organizing the archeological field methods class, which provides students with hands-on experience in cultural resource management, a skill they can take with them into the professional field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been really fulfilling to continue my relationships with the folks at UCSC,&#8221; Peelo said. &#8220;And I hope to continue to do so in the future.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/04/risa-wechsler.html"><strong>Risa Wechsler</strong></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Ph.D. Physics&#8217; 01)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has always been interested in the biggest questions of the universe:&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did the universe form? What is it made of? How did it evolve over the last 13.8 billion years? How did structure form in the universe?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those questions stayed with Wechsler throughout her academic career as she pursued an S.B. in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a Ph.D. in physics at UC Santa Cruz. She has since played an instrumental role in groundbreaking research in the cosmology field, with pioneering galaxy structure and cosmic structure surveys and more than 300 widely cited publications. Wechsler has also taken strides in ensuring the growth of diversity and inclusion within the physics and astronomy community.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the great privileges of being in this field is that I get to think about these really big questions every day,&#8221; Wechsler said. &#8220;The last 25 years in this field have been incredible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her research interests are focused on understanding the growth of structure in the universe, how structure formation drives galaxy formation, and how galaxies can be used to probe the fundamental physics of the universe. A majority of her work looks at the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Wechsler uses large computer simulations, physical and empirical models, and the deepest and largest galaxy surveys to determine how the universe formed and evolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 2014 to 2018, she was the co-spokesperson for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (</span><a href="http://desi.lbl.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DESI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and is a founding member of the Dark Energy Survey (</span><a href="http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DES</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and the </span><a href="http://www.lsst-desc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LSST dark energy science collaboration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Wechsler has also played an essential role in understanding the smallest galaxies in the universe and understanding how our home galaxy, the Milky Way, is connected to other similar galaxies, including through a project she leads with another former UCSC alumna, Marla Geha, called the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wechsler is currently a professor of physics at the </span><a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Stanford University. She is also the director of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC). Committed to public outreach and the advancement of diversity and equity, Wechsler founded an equity and inclusion committee within KIPAC, citing the underrepresentation of women and people of color not only within Stanford, but in the physics and astronomy communities as a whole.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has created a hunger for accurate science journalism, separating facts from misinformation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of this year&#8217;s </span><a href="https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> celebration at UCSC, three alumni of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s prestigious </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Program who cover the pandemic will share what they have learned during a virtual </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/university_forum_featuring_julia_calderone_nicholas_st_fleur?_gl=1*1s0aodr*_ga*MTg4ODg0MzE4My4xNTY2NTgxMjUx*_ga_BWJ4Z4Y66X*MTY0OTk2MzQ4Mi44MC4wLjE2NDk5NjM0ODIuMA..#.Ylhx7dPMI2J"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University Forum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 5:30&#8211;7 p.m. on Tuesday, April 19.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forum calls attention to a well-regarded program that has produced professional science writers since 1981. The program is one academic year long, focusing entirely on practical training through rigorous coursework and diverse internships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's the only graduate science writing program in the U.S. that requires a degree in science and experience in research, and it has produced many successful alumni, including the featured panelists.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forum is not to be missed, said Nichole Silva, director of strategic programs and audience development at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see this forum as a look behind the curtain to learn what journalists go through to report on stories in the midst of a crisis," Silva said. "It&#8217;s also a great moment to celebrate the education these alums received here at UC Santa Cruz. We will be joined by three award-winning alumni of our Science Communication Program who are all working in some of the most respected news organizations around.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calderone, a staff editor at the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New York Times,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was among a large team of reporters and editors honored on June 11 with the </span><a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/new-york-times-6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The award, regarded as the most prestigious of the annual Pulitzer Prizes in journalism, recognized a </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/2021-pulitzer-coronavirus-coverage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deep package of 15 stories and data-analysis displays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the coronavirus pandemic assembled in 2020 by the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New York Times.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pulitzer Prize Board cited the team for its "courageous, prescient and sweeping coverage of the coronavirus pandemic that exposed racial and economic inequities, government failures in the U.S. and beyond, and filled a data vacuum that helped local governments, healthcare providers, businesses and individuals to be better prepared and protected."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicholas St. Fleur received the 2021 </span><a href="https://casw.org/awards-fellowships/clark-payne/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evert Clark/Seth Payne Award from the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the top annual prize in the U.S. for science journalists age 30 or younger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has been praised for his unique coverage of the COVID crisis. In fall 2020, he reported a story about two presidents of historically Black colleges in New Orleans who were subject to a &#8220;huge backlash&#8221; after suggesting to members of their communities that they enroll in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While surprising to some, the incident was emblematic of a legacy of medical mistrust in the Black community borne from a troubling history of racism and inequity in medicine,&#8221; St. Fleur wrote.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also reported a story called &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/02/07/virtual-event-the-exhaustion-epidemic-burnout/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhaustion epidemic: Examining the Covid-19 burnout crisis in health care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

Researchers have now developed global forecasts that can provide up to a year of advance warning of marine heatwaves.</p>
<p>The forecasts could help fishing fleets, ocean managers, and coastal communities anticipate the effects of these events. Described in a paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04573-9">published April 20 in <em>Nature</em></a><em>,</em> the forecasts were developed by a team of scientists affiliated with the <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA) and the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://ims.ucsc.edu/">Institute of Marine Sciences</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forecasts of extreme events in the marine world are essential to climate adaptation and ensuring our coastal communities are resilient,&#8221; said coauthor Stephanie Brodie, a project scientist at the Institute of Marine Sciences who is also affiliated with NOAA. &#8220;We can accurately predict marine heatwaves, in some cases up to a year in advance, which is really useful for people faced with making decisions in the near term.&#8221;</p>
<p>One such heatwave, known as &#8220;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/07/blob-and-elnino.html">the Blob</a>,&#8221; emerged in 2014 in the northeast Pacific Ocean and persisted through 2016. It led to shifting fish stocks, harmful algal blooms, entanglements of endangered humpback whales, and thousands of starving sea lion pups washing up on beaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have seen marine heatwaves cause sudden and pronounced changes in ocean ecosystems around the world, and forecasts can help us anticipate what may be coming,&#8221; said lead author Michael Jacox, a research scientist at NOAA who is also affiliated with UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences.</p>
<p><a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/marine-heatwaves">Marine heatwave forecasts</a> will be available online through NOAA&#8217;s Physical Sciences Laboratory. The researchers called the forecasts a &#8220;key advance toward improved climate adaptation and resilience for marine-dependent communities around the globe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The forecasts leverage global climate models to predict the likely emergence of new marine heatwaves. &#8220;This is a really exciting way to use existing modeling tools in a much-needed new application,&#8221; Jacox said.</p>
<h2>Reducing Impacts</h2>
<p>Impacts of marine heatwaves have been documented in ecosystems around the world, particularly in the past decade. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fish and shellfish declines that caused global fishery losses of hundreds of millions of dollars</li>
<li>Shifting distributions of marine species that increased human-wildlife conflict and disputes about fishing rights</li>
<li>Extremely warm waters that have caused bleaching and mass mortalities of corals</li>
</ul>
<p>On the U.S. West Coast, marine heatwaves gained notoriety following the Blob, which rattled the California Current Ecosystem starting in 2014. That marine heatwave led to an ecological cascade in which whales&#8217; prey was concentrated unusually close to shore, and a severe bloom of toxic algae along the coast delayed opening of the valuable Dungeness crab fishery. Humpback whales moved closer to shore to feed in some of the same waters targeted by the crab fishery. As fishermen tried to make up for lost time after the delay by deploying additional crab traps, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/01/whale-entanglements.html">whales became entangled in record numbers</a> in the lines attached to crab traps.</p>
<p>Recent research has also connected marine heatwaves along the West Coast to a northward shift in California market squid, which have long supported one of California&#8217;s largest commercial fisheries.</p>
<p>NOAA Fisheries scientists have since developed a <a href="https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/regions/california-current/california-current-marine-heatwave-tracker-blobtracker">Marine Heatwave Tracker</a> that monitors the North Pacific Ocean for signs of marine heatwaves. The forecasts go a step further to anticipate where marine heatwaves are likely to emerge in coming months, and how long they are expected to persist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Extreme events in concert with increasing global temperatures can serve as a catalyst for ecosystem change and reorganization,&#8221; said coauthor Elliott Hazen, a research ecologist at NOAA and adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC. &#8220;While marine heatwaves can have some unanticipated effects, knowing what&#8217;s coming allows for a more precautionary approach to lessen the impact on both fisheries and protected species. Understanding the ocean is the first step towards forecasting ecological changes and incorporating that foresight into decision-making.&#8221;</p>
<h2>El Ni&#241;o<strong><br/></strong></h2>
<p>The forecasts are most accurate during periods influenced by the El Ni&#241;o-Southern Oscillation, a well-known climate pattern in the Pacific Ocean. In fact, El Ni&#241;o (the warm phase of the oscillation) could be considered the &#8220;world&#8217;s most prominent marine heatwave,&#8221; Jacox said. It demonstrates that the heatwaves themselves are not new.</p>
<p>The forecasts cannot predict marine heatwaves as far in advance in regions such as the Mediterranean Sea, or off the U.S. East Coast. The atmosphere and ocean fluctuate more rapidly in these areas. The forecasts provide the greatest foresight in areas with known ocean-climate patterns such as the Indo-Pacific region north of Australia, the California Current System, and the northern Brazil Current.</p>
<p>&#8220;The global focus of this study highlighted for me that there are regions out there being affected by marine heatwaves that we haven&#8217;t seen in the scientific literature,&#8221; Brodie said. &#8220;Marine heatwaves do occur globally, and we want to enable everyone to look at forecasts in their regions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scientists noted that managers of fisheries and other marine life must weigh their reaction to predicted marine heatwaves based on the potential consequences. For example, they would need to weigh the economic costs of limiting fisheries ahead of a marine heatwave against the risk of inadvertently entangling endangered whales or sea turtles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about the difference between making informed choices and reacting to changes as they impact ecosystems,&#8221; Hazen said. &#8220;That is always going to be a balance, but now it is a much more informed one.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2f4911c48072704664be42b483b0f70d"><name>shimizu</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Coming together to heal</title><summary>UCSC Arts dean and her family establish scholarship in sonâ€™s memory</summary><start-date>1650056400000</start-date><display-name>shimizu-scholarship</display-name><path>/2022/04/shimizu</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/shimizu</link><created-by>jhillard</created-by><created-on>1650060759468</created-on><last-modified-by>jhillard</last-modified-by><last-modified>1650060759468</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Faculty Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Christy Tall</name><title></title><phone/><email>chtall@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/lakas-portrait-final-214x300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/lakas-portrait-final-214x300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lakas-portrait-final-214x300.jpg</name><display-name>lakas-portrait-final-214x300.jpg</display-name><file-size>16840</file-size><width>214</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Lakas Shimizu</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/lakas-portrait-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/lakas-portrait-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lakas-portrait-80.jpg</name><display-name>lakas-portrait-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>19093</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Lakas Shimizu</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>A new scholarship established by Arts Dean Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu and members of her family was inspired by her son Lakas Shimizu, who died when he was eight.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/8-24-21-shimizu-cl-022.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/8-24-21-shimizu-cl-022.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>8-24-21-shimizu-cl-022.jpg</name><display-name>8-24-21-shimizu-cl-022.jpg</display-name><file-size>32485</file-size><width>542</width><height>360</height></image><image-alt>Arts Dean Celine ParreÃ±as Shimizu</image-alt><image-caption>Arts Dean Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>UCSC Arts dean and her family establish scholarship in sonâ€™s memory</article-subhead><article-text><p>Lakas Shimizu was a gentle warrior, a deeply caring, generous, and empathetic young man who had a gift for drawing people together. Lakas unexpectedly passed away at the tender age of eight. In his memory, his family&#8212;parents Dan Shimizu and Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu, brother Bayan Shimizu, and grandfather Robert Shimizu&#8212;established a scholarship at UC Santa Cruz. The scholarship honors Lakas&#8217; spirit by supporting students in the arts who engage in artistic and creative scholarly practice, and who organize people together to make an impact for inclusion and equity.<br/><br/>Lakas was always interested in helping people and making sure they felt included, his parents share. He went out of his way to make friends with new kids at school, and had a special talent for making people feel welcome. &#8220;He made bringing people together look fun!&#8221; He was also the peer-selected &#8220;judge&#8221; on his elementary school playground&#8212;other students would turn to him to adjudicate when issues or disagreements arose.<br/><br/>&#8220;Lakas had a very strong sense of right, and was absolutely fearless about implementing it,&#8221; says his mother, Celine. &#8221;He had unflinching self-acceptance and self-presentation in a world where there is such a hierarchy of what a leader looks like.&#8221; <br/><br/>When Lakas was six years old, he told his parents that his dream was for everyone to be treated the same.<br/><br/>&#8220;Lakas had a natural eight-year-old&#8217;s awareness about race and difference,&#8221; says his father, Dan. &#8220;When he drew self-portraits, he always gave himself dark skin. He internalized that he&#8217;s a person of color without voicing it directly. If he had been older, he would have been interested in promoting diversity. He didn&#8217;t have the words diversity and inclusion, but he would have been all in.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Lakas was a very special human being,&#8221; says his grandfather, Robert Shimizu. &#8220;We were fortunate to have him in our lives. Lakas cared about people and bringing them together. This scholarship celebrates who he could have been by helping other people achieve their hopes and dreams.&#8221;<br/><br/></p>
<h3>A scholarship reflecting Lakas' spirit</h3>
<p>The family wants to help transform opportunities for scholars by ensuring that finances are not a barrier for students pursuing higher education in the Arts. <br/><br/>&#8220;Equal access to education is very important to us,&#8221; says Celine. &#8220;We were living in Hillsborough, California, at the time (of Lakas&#8217; passing). It&#8217;s a very wealthy community and yet just across the street, just across El Camino, it&#8217;s a very different environment. There&#8217;s poverty, there&#8217;s hunger, there&#8217;s homelessness. It&#8217;s not visible to everybody but it&#8217;s something that really concerned Lakas.&#8221;<br/><br/>The family hopes that the scholarship will create opportunities for UCSC Arts students. Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu joined UC Santa Cruz as Dean of the Arts Division and Distinguished Professor of Film and Digital Media in July 2021. She brings a passion for continuing the division&#8217;s culture of welcoming students as professional artists the moment they step onto campus. She encourages students to dig deeply into their pain, their suffering, their joy, and their differences to create art that is meaningful to them. <br/><br/>Lakas leaned into his strengths, he understood the responsibility of becoming great, and identifying what you&#8217;re good at. The family says they learned so much from him, and the spirit of the scholarship in his memory reflects that. They want to amplify his approach to cherishing being together and doing great things in a way that invites a person to be themselves fully.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Helping the students find their role</h3>
&#8220;Using that to get through, to survive, to create a change in the world precisely because you are alive. I think a lot about that with our students,&#8221; Celine says. &#8220;If we&#8217;re only going to have them for a few years, what they need to leave school with is a strong sense of how they can contribute in a way that is distinctive to them. If this scholarship can help them achieve that sense of security and certainty in the way they will move forward in the world knowing that they will encounter loss&#8212;that they will face obstacles and the scholarship gives them the strength to overcome them&#8212;then how truly wonderful is that?&#8221;<br/><br/>Celine was a political asylee and refugee, and says she relied upon the charity of others when she arrived in the United States as a child. Scholarships allowed her to pursue education. Philanthropy had always been important to Dan&#8217;s family, and she learned from them. <br/><br/>&#8220;The importance of our family&#8217;s philanthropy became accelerated after Lakas died,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We want to continue Lakas&#8217; spirit of giving. It feels so good to give to others. Instead of hoarding resources, it&#8217;s important to share them. And do it purposefully, with meaning.&#8221;<br/><br/>Dan agrees, adding, &#8220;to help others is a way we can intentionally promote the things we believe in.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;So much of the gift is for us to imagine Lakas here and to let his spirit ripple through the community and enable other people to flourish,&#8221; Celine says.<br/><br/>To contribute to UCSC in this and other ways, please contact Sarah Schuster Kudela at schuster@ucsc.edu.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3e8ef6ea8072704664be42b4368b9008"><name>ricky-le</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>The UC in Washington program launches political career</title><summary>The UCDC program launched alumnus Ricky Leâ€™s (Rachel Carson, Politics â€™99) career in national politics. </summary><start-date>1650317400000</start-date><display-name>ricky-le</display-name><path>/2022/04/ricky-le</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/ricky-le</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1650316998356</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1653161797857</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>aapi-history</value><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Christy Tall</name><title></title><phone/><email>chtall@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/1561061049464.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2022/1561061049464.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>1561061049464.jpeg</name><display-name>1561061049464.jpeg</display-name><file-size>40865</file-size><width>500</width><height>500</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/rickylethumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/rickylethumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rickylethumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>rickylethumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>13513</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCDC program launched Ricky Le&#8217;s (Rachel Carson, Politics &#8217;99) career in national politics.

He had little idea what to expect, nor whether he would even like it, but his experience with UCDC&#8212;made possible in part by philanthropic support at UC Santa Cruz &#8212;completely changed the trajectory of his life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> UC in Washington program </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">supervises and supports students who pursue a quarter of academic study and internship work in the nation&#8217;s capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students spend three to four days a week at their internships&#8212;gaining hands-on experience working in a variety of opportunities that can include positions on Capitol Hill, in government agencies, major media outlets, cultural institutions or other nonprofit organizations, or at one of the many corporations with a presence in DC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of his UCDC internship, Le fell in love with politics&#8212;launching a career that has included a variety of political roles including working as a policy advisor for U.S. Representative Zoe Lofgren and executive director of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation. Le has called Washington DC home since 2005 and currently serves as Chief of Staff for U.S. Representative Linda Sanchez of California&#8217;s 38th district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Before UCDC, I had an interest in politics, but I was really unsure about my career path,&#8221; Le says. &#8220;My participation in UCDC changed my life, and opened up new avenues. It helped me realize that I want to be in DC, on Capitol Hill, participating in national politics.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Le, a Vietnamese refugee, was a first generation college student. He chose to attend UC Santa Cruz in part because doing so would allow him to remain close to the support of family and friends in his hometown of San Jose. Coming from a low-income family, he says he didn&#8217;t feel sure he belonged in higher education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He found a caring and supportive community at the university, though, and says he felt comfortable being himself. It was one of Le&#8217;s professors, Dan Wirls, who encouraged him to apply to UCDC. &#8220;He saw potential in me before I saw the potential in myself,&#8221; Le says. Le credits much of his ultimate success to the nurturing environment at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCDC Washington Program offers a unique&#8211;and even life-changing&#8211;opportunity for UCSC students, and philanthropy is key. Tuition is the same as it is for students on campus, and a scholarship that supports a student at UC Santa Cruz can carry over&#160; to UCDC. The need for scholarships, however, often outweighs the number available. Additional UCDC expenses&#8212;which are the responsibility of program participants&#8211; include travel to DC, housing, food, the cost of business attire, and other needs. And while some of the internships offer a stipend, many do not.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Philanthropy can make the difference between a deserving student being able to participate in UCDC or not,&#8221; notes Dr. Wirls, who in addition to being a professor of politics is also the UCSC director of UCDC. &#8220;Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve seen students who were accepted into the program decline because they felt like they couldn&#8217;t afford it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCDC set Ricky Le on a career path he never would have imagined. Le encourages other UCSC students to participate in programs like UCDC and take advantage of all the resources the campus has to offer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, go beyond your comfort zone&#8212;you&#8217;ll be surprised by what you can do,&#8221; Le says.</span></p>

style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) MFA program presents </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">unforgetting, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the culminating exhibition of its 2022 MFA cohort, on view free to the public at the Digital Arts Research Center April 22-May 1 with a special performance May 20-29 at the Experimental Theater. Curated by DANM affiliate faculty, research associate, and lecturer in music and art Yolande Harris, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">unforgetting</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> features a diverse array of new media art works by five graduating artists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The exhibition captures the essence of the five individual voices that have formed out of two years of concentrated artistic research and development at DANM,&#8221; says Harris. &#8220;Common threads of lost histories, hidden realties, and hauntings permeate the works.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohamadreza Babaee, an Iranian performance and digital media studies scholar and transdisciplinary artist, contributes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global (re)Entry, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a work that creatively simulates the Customs and Border Protection agency&#8217;s Global Entry software, created to ease traveler screening for &#8216;low-risk&#8217; US citizens and permanent residents, and redesigns it as a pro-immigrant 2D video game and installation. Says Babaee, &#8220;This project aims to intervene in the failing, current US immigration system. The game encourages a closer look at systems through which social, political, and civic ostracization of immigrants is perpetuated. Moreover, the project invites players to formulate an ideal vision of society based in equality, fairness, and inclusion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egyptian-American film and theater maker Laura Boutros explores the Egyptian-American diaspora in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amduat: The Twelve Hours of Ra,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an immersive, multimedia theater work taking place over two weekends, May 20-29. The work, which draws on ancient Egyptian myths, situates Egyptian aesthetics in the Western museum space, taking audiences on a &#8216;docent&#8217; tour led by major figures in Egypt&#8217;s Pharaonic age. &#8220;The piece questions the legacies of colonialism in narratives and history while highlighting the media&#8217;s role in perpetuating misinformation surrounding Egypt&#8217;s stories,&#8221; says Boutros.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troubled Waters: The Ocean as a Contested Space in California Surf Culture</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the name of Dave Crellin&#8217;s site-specific installation exploring the history of white supremacy, racialized exclusion, and erasure in surf and beach popular culture. The project includes an ongoing intervention at surf sites along the California coast using surf culture-styled stickers embedded with QR codes to educate the public; activism within surf marketing and consumer culture; audio recordings of surfers of color; and an interactive website. Says Crellin, an interdisciplinary artist and lifelong surfer, &#8220;My hope is that this project instantiates a reckoning and reevaluation in white surf culture, brings greater awareness to surfers of color, scholars, activists, and creatives working to change surf culture, and opens further space to reimagine the beach and ocean as places of equity, inclusion, diversity, and community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forest Reid, a sound designer, composer, and installation artist, presents </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Last Galician Switchboard</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an interactive, multi-screen video installation that follows a switchboard operator in 1930s Detroit who is haunted by family left behind in Eastern Europe. The piece was inspired by familial letters from the late 1910s that contain words of personal anguish and pleas for help from relatives in war-ravaged Europe. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Last Galician Switchboard</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> incorporates these letters as well as excerpts from Yiddish theater, literature, and folklore. &#8220;The work uses switchboards to patch the dead into the living, to answer unanswered letters of desperation, and to connect the present to the past that haunts it,&#8221; states Reid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">dani wright, a queer game designer and digital artist, offers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">blood play</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an installation that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">explores their concept of a &#8216;queer gothic&#8217; genre through game fragments, printed zines, installation, and theory. wright says, &#8220;The work I am presenting sets an example for how we, as queer game designers, can engage with queer, gothic, and monster theory while working within the queer gothic genre, which I identify as a radical genre that relies on gothic structures to usurp the status quo.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DANM researches the creative potentials and social implications of emerging technologies and digital cultural practices. The two-year MFA program emphasizes artistic and technological innovation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and social action.&#160;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of core research around providing girls and women opportunities to solve social problems through technology,&#8221; Isbister explained. &#8220;There&#8217;s more interest in computation if girls are able to craft technology to solve issues that they care about and are relevant to them.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The camp aims to build an inclusive computational community that is girl-focused and welcoming to those from historically underrepresented communities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;One of the main design ideas behind the camp is to decrease the distance between introducing a technical concept and making something fun out of it,&#8221; said James Fey, computational media Ph.D. student and SET Lab researcher.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The five-day program incorporates elements of design, coding, acting, and the genre of mystery to create a fictional storyline, role-playing format where participants must craft wearable technologies that support social interactions needed to complete a series of tasks and activities.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the limitations of COVID-19 restrictions over the past two years, SWEL Camp serves as just the right remedy for curbing pandemic fatigue in young students.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Narratives, wearable technologies, and social experiences&#160;</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The title of the camp&#8217;s narrative is &#8220;Anywear Academy,&#8221; with an emphasis on the word &#8220;wear,&#8221; as participants have to code and wear the technology they design to complete missions. For example, one segment of the camp challenges students to code their wearables to attain the same color of LED lighting as their team members. Once they do that, they can then move on to the next task.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the course of five days, camp participants &#8220;travel&#8221; to three different worlds: a fairytale world, superhero vs. villain world, and a space world. Each world presents a different storyline with a different set of mysteries to solve.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students use a combination of wiring tools and basic coding programming languages to fabricate wearable technology. The pieces produced in the past two camps included LED lights and wired material that were worn around the participants&#8217; necks and waists and also acted as costumes, augmenting the immersive LARP experience.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Students were sculpting their experiences as they went along, becoming the fictional characters and solving problems as a team,&#8221; Isbister said.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students are encouraged to take the materials they design in camp home and are provided various resources to guide them in crafting and coding their own technology once the camp concludes.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first session of the SWEL camp was held last summer in Berkeley, and the nonprofit organization <a href="https://www.thegameacademy.org/"><span class="s2">The Game Academy</span></a>&#8212;which runs LARP classes and camps for kids ages 8&#8211;18 to enrich social, emotional, and academic success&#8212;was a major contributor to its design as well as its implementation. UCSC researchers began working with Game Academy in 2020 to learn how to blend their social wearable technologies expertise into a LARP setting to create an engaging, fictional narrative for camp participants to experience.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second session ran in February of this year over two weekends at <a href="https://digitalnest.org/"><span class="s2">Digital NEST</span></a>, bringing together 13 middle school-aged students from local Salinas and Monterey schools.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">UCSC plans to run two sessions of SWEL Camp this summer, one in coordination with The Game Academy, and the other on campus through the <a href="https://epc.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s2">UC Santa Cruz Educational Partnership Center (EPC)</span></a> Girls in Engineering program. The EPC oversees the UC Santa Cruz Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement <a href="https://mesa.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s2">(MESA) program</span></a>, which the researchers worked closely with to secure locations for the camp and recruit girls from other Baskin Engineering-hosted programs, such as <a href="https://gie.soe.ucsc.edu/girls-engineering"><span class="s2">Girls in Engineering</span></a>. Both internal and external partnerships were crucial in the successful running of the first two camps.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Key takeaways and future directions</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The camp teaches students a diverse set of soft and hard skills, including group communication, collaboration, problem solving, technical design, coding, and user experience design. It was established to become a use case for other institutions and organizations to adopt and carry out on their own.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unlike traditional afterschool programs and summer camps that have a single focus, this program has various aspects to it and helps capture a diverse group of students.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Because this camp casts a wide net of activities, interests, and genres, it&#8217;s catching a lot of students that would have otherwise fallen through the cracks from more traditional programming,&#8221; Fey said.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ultimate goal of the NSF-funded project is to &#8220;create a sustainable makerspace camp for different institutions and organizations to adopt,&#8221; Isbister explained.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the summer sessions conclude, UCSC researchers are hoping to provide material, best practices, and successful use cases for schools, nonprofits, and other organizations to carry out the program, furthering efforts to bridge the gender and diversity gap in technology and computation.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="440fb8d18072704664be42b4b1ecb892"><name>take-back-the-night-chanel-miller-advance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Take Back the Night: Chanel Miller to be keynote speaker </title><summary>Bestselling author Chanel Miller will appear at UCSC in a virtual keynote event that is part of the Take Back the Night series and Sexual Assault Awareness Month.

This free event will take place on Tuesday, April 26, from 6:30&#8211;8 p.m.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chanel Miller is a writer and artist who received her B.A. in literature from UC Santa Barbara. Her critically acclaimed memoir, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know My Name,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bestseller, a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times Book Review </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notable Book, and a National Book Critics Circle Award winner, and was named the best book of 2019 in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Tribune</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, NPR, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">People,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is a 2019 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Next 100 honoree and a 2016 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glamour</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Woman of the Year honoree under her pseudonym, "Emily Doe."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miller's presentation is about personal agency and using storytelling as a form of healing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event organizers credit Chanel Miller with bringing awareness about sexual assault into the center of mainstream conversations, and inspiring survivors to speak their truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Take Back the Night series is the result of a collaboration between the UCSC Womxn&#8217;s Center, Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE), and the Dean of Students Office.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is my hope that inviting Chanel Miller to speak with UCSC will bring wider attention to the issues she covers in her memoir, and send a message about the kind of campus community we want to cultivate,&#8221; said Garrett Naiman, Associate Vice Chancellor and Dean of Students. &#8220;She has gifted all of us with her voice and her truth, and her visit should prompt us to elevate our dialogue about sexual assault and supporting survivors at UC Santa Cruz and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The book has transformed conversations about how we should be approaching education, prevention, and intervention services on and off college campuses around the country,&#8221; Naiman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Reading </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know My Name</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenged me to think about the ways I, as an individual, administrator, and community member can work with others to push for better, more thoughtful, and caring ways of responding to the needs of those in our community who have been impacted by sexual violence,&#8221; Naiman said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To register for the event as well as pick up a free copy of the book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know My Name,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> follow the links below.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each day throughout the week will include a different program to highlight and support survivors on campus.

In theory, this model can advance the service mission of public universities. But there&#8217;s been little follow-up research to assess the value and impacts of these projects from the perspective of the community partners they aim to serve.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://openjournals.libs.uga.edu/jheoe/article/view/2512/2722"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, conducted by UC Santa Cruz, draws on the experiences of community partners across 15 community-engaged research projects to reveal the importance of centering equity in approaches to this work. The findings show that, while community-engaged research has potential to help mitigate historical harms caused by extractive research models, there are still power imbalances affecting these projects that present ethical challenges.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To study this issue, researchers looked back on the University of California&#8217;s Center for Collaborative Research for an Equitable California (CCREC), an initiative that provided start-up funding for community-engaged research projects across the state from 2011 to 2015 and was at the forefront of the field&#8217;s progression. At the time, researchers interviewed community partners from 15 of the center&#8217;s funded projects to learn what motivated them to join these partnerships and what benefits and challenges they experienced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insights that community partners shared still resonate today. And their publication in the new study is an important opportunity for reflection, at a moment when the field is seeing increased funding, interest, and recognition that could help chart a course for its future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope that what today&#8217;s practitioners of community-engaged research will take away from this study is a sense of humility in building partnerships and about the knowledge they hold and that the communities hold, so that they enter this research equitably,&#8221; said Professor of Education Ronald Glass, former director of CCREC and a coauthor of the new paper.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the paper says that community organizations are often motivated to partner with universities on research in order to &#8220;know better and more systematically what they already know.&#8221; In other words, community-serving organizations already have a strong understanding&#8212;through lived experience, anecdotal evidence, and their own research&#8212;about the issues impacting their communities and what solutions could help.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University researchers, then, should understand that community-engaged research partnerships are often not creating new knowledge, so much as offering new methods or tools to deepen existing community knowledge or validate it in the eyes of funders and government agencies. Community partners explained that those in positions of power often consider community knowledge to be biased or illegitimate but are more accepting of findings from a university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some of the community partners we interviewed said they were capable of doing these research projects themselves, but unless a university puts their stamp on it, it won&#8217;t be considered legitimate,&#8221; said Associate Professor of Sociology Rebecca London, a coauthor of the report. &#8220;The resulting research findings will not necessarily be different from what a community organization already knows, but funders and others don't recognize that existing knowledge.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper goes on to discuss how efforts to legitimize community knowledge through a university partnership are often a double-edged sword. While such partnerships may advance a community organization&#8217;s near-term goals to have their voices heard on a specific issue, they can also reinforce power imbalances in knowledge production by positioning the university in an authorizing role, rather than building the authority of community organizations themselves.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address this, the paper&#8217;s authors say community-engaged research projects should look for ways to tackle the research question at hand while also challenging norms about whose knowledge counts. For example, one community partner in the study noted that authorship credits on reports and papers could build the authority of a community organization by positioning them in a lead role and the university in a supporting role. These types of arrangements would likely require universities to reconsider merit review policies, in order to ensure faculty receive appropriate internal recognition for their community-engaged research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power imbalances between community and university partners can also show up in whose needs are prioritized during the research process, the paper notes. Production timelines for community-engaged research among projects in the study were almost exclusively driven by academic calendars, rather than the policy and organizing needs of the community. And, though collaborative research requires a significant investment of time and resources from community partners, they often did not receive a portion of the research funding.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s important in any partnership to understand where the other person is coming from and get their needs met, and universities are often bad at this, partly because we are big bureaucracies, and that can make us self-centered,&#8221; London said. &#8220;But the representatives of universities in these partnerships should work to anticipate needs and mitigate potential problems through good planning in advance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the paper issues a reminder that &#8220;research is not an inherent social good.&#8221; Even well-intentioned, forward-thinking models, like community-engaged research, can reproduce injustices unless ethical issues are carefully and collaboratively considered. Critical reflection on these issues was core to CCREC&#8217;s work, and there are initiatives carrying that forward today, like UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/work/campus-community/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus + Community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Center, where London is the inaugural faculty director.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The findings from this paper really speak to a need for shared values and an ethical approach to community-engaged research, taking the time to build trust and relationships, and democratizing how we think about knowledge production,&#8221; London said. &#8220;The work that CCREC started on this is still incredibly important, especially as the field has become more prominent in recent years, and there are lingering questions that need to be addressed.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="487b57858072704664be42b4bcc22e78"><name>cruzfoam-star-investors</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Cruz Foam teams up with DiCaprio, Kutcher as advisors and adds a major industry partner</title><summary>Cruz Foam, a company that started as a Ph.D. studentâ€™s project at the UC Santa Cruz Baskin School of Engineering and makes a compostable alternative to styrofoam packaging, has added actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Ashton Kutcher as advisors and investors. </summary><start-date>1650438000000</start-date><path>/2022/04/cruzfoam-star-investors</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/cruzfoam-star-investors</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1650483484526</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1650483697425</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/cruz-foam-325.png</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/cruz-foam-325.png</link><site>news</site><name>cruz-foam-325.png</name><display-name>cruz-foam-325.png</display-name><file-size>106832</file-size><width>325</width><height>183</height></image><image-alt>Leonardo DiCaprio and Ashton Kutcher.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/cruz-foam-80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/cruz-foam-80.png</link><site>news</site><name>cruz-foam-80.png</name><display-name>cruz-foam-80.png</display-name><file-size>11796</file-size><width>80</width><height>45</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portraits of Leonardo DiCaprio and Ashton Kutcher.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span class="s2">Actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Ashton Kutcher have joined Cruz Foam as investors and advisors.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.cruzfoam.com/">Cruz Foam</a></span><span class="s2">, a company that started as a Ph.D. student&#8217;s project at the UC Santa Cruz Baskin School of Engineering and makes a compostable alternative to styrofoam packaging out of transformed shrimp shells, has added major starpower to their team in their transition to commercialization. Actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Ashton Kutcher have joined as investors and advisors to the circular materials company, and home appliances giant Whirlpool is now their customer.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The company began in a Baskin Engineering basement laboratory, where co-founder and CEO John Felts, an electrical and computer engineering (ECE) Ph.D. student at the time, made the first foam. The company&#8217;s innovative reuse of chitin, the tough, versatile, and completely biodegradable material found in natural abundance in the shells of sea life, has propelled it to major growth.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">&#8220;Cruz Foam&#8217;s unique approach to creating a green packaging material has caught the eye of major players in industry,&#8221; said Marco Rolandi, co-founder and CSO of CruzFoam and chair of the ECE department at UCSC. &#8220;What started as a creative biopolymer engineering project on campus has the potential to greatly transform packaging, and we are excited to see our mission backed by trusted, market-tested partners like Whirlpool as well as high-profile investors who can bring global awareness to our work.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Cruz Foam provides an inexpensive and scalable product for an industry yearning for eco-friendly alternatives to single-use, petroleum-based products. The company also announced it is opening a major production facility to accommodate this growth.&#160;</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">"Cruz Foam is taking a major step in reducing the environmental impact of the supply chain industry," Leonardo DiCaprio said in a press release statement. "The mission to eliminate single use plastics in the ongoing battle for a cleaner and more sustainable environment makes me excited to join as an investor and advisor and I look forward to what we'll achieve together."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="495547d88072704664be42b4b4fcb213"><name>claire-pierangelo</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Alumnaâ€™s foreign service success earns her a new post as U.S. Ambassador</title><summary>Claire Pierangelo (Kresge College, History â€™82) will be sworn in as Ambassador to the Republic of Madagascar and the Union of the Comoros on May 2.</summary><start-date>1650551400000</start-date><display-name>claire-pierangelo</display-name><path>/2022/04/claire-pierangelo</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/claire-pierangelo</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1650497767363</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1650909104170</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Paula Hermann</name><title></title><phone/><email>paula@phcreativestrategies.com</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/claire_a._pierangelo.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/claire_a._pierangelo.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>claire_a._pierangelo.jpg</name><display-name>claire_a._pierangelo.jpg</display-name><file-size>70019</file-size><width>440</width><height>550</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/clairethumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/04/clairethumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>clairethumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>clairethumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>15132</file-size><width>64</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claire Pierangelo (Kresge College, History &#8217;82) will serve as US Ambassador to Madagascar.</span></em></p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claire Pierangelo <em>(Kresge College, History &#8217;82)</em> was confirmed on March 2, 2022 by the United States Senate as the U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Madagascar and the Union of the Comoros. A career member of the Senior Foreign Service, Pierangelo has served across four continents, most recently as the Principal Officer of the United States Consulate General, Lagos, Nigeria.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she arrived at UC Santa Cruz, Pierangelo planned to follow her family&#8217;s legacy and become a medical professional, but she recalibrated after studying abroad in Italy her junior year. Combining her passion for history and economics with her enthusiasm for international travel, she found her niche as a European history major intent on pursuing international finance.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After earning a master&#8217;s degree in international studies and economics at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies she took some time off to teach scuba diving (a skill she honed while attending UCSC) in the Caribbean. When she returned, she had a job waiting for her in international banking with an opportunity for a global post within five years. However, an invitation by the U.S. Department of State promising an immediate post abroad was more appealing.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I took my first assignment, I thought I would try it, and if I didn&#8217;t like it, I would go into international banking,&#8221; said Pierangelo. &#8220;That moment never came. I liked it a lot. I&#8217;ve been sent to great places. It&#8217;s been a really interesting career.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past 30 years, as a member of the U.S. Department of State, Pierangelo has led teams that have managed America&#8217;s relationships with foreign governments, carried out multiple Presidents&#8217; foreign policies, and advocated the interests of the U.S. to the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In my role, I help ensure the U.S. and its people succeed. I am working for the people of the United States,&#8221; said Pierangelo.&#8221; My work adds to the U.S. educational bounty, helps take care of Americans who get into trouble and promotes economic and commercial growth. Doing something good for the U.S. and its people is our ultimate goal.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pierangelo later earned her second master&#8217;s degree in national security and resource strategy from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces/National Defense University in 2004. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Pomp and Peril: All in a Day&#8217;s Work</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pierangelo speaks Vietnamese, French, Italian, Indonesian, basic Spanish and Creole. She has had numerous leadership positions across multiple bureaus in 11 countries in Central Europe, England, Haiti, Italy, Malta, Indonesia and Japan. She has negotiated significant international trade agreements and facilitated logistics during global healthcare crises and humanitarian efforts. Protecting the U.S. from afar also means close encounters with dangerous situations like navigating terrorist attacks, maritime security threats, and natural disasters.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every day is different, based on what is going on in the world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lived in lovely countries that were extremely dangerous. We understand the risks when we go overseas, and we do it willingly. It can be gritty and heart wrenching, like searching for Americans after the second bombing in Bali, but you always keep in mind the goal of protecting American lives and the interests of the United States.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While managing crises is part of her responsibilities, she also presides over ceremonies and momentous occasions, negotiates peace agreements and assists with transformational initiatives, such as the EducationUSA Opportunity Funds Program, a $4.35 million initiative that enabled 30 Nigerian undergraduate and graduate students to attend United States universities. According to Pierangelo, her combined seven years of work in Vietnam, when serving as Deputy Chief of Mission and Charge d&#8217;Affaires, as well as economic counselor, ranks top among her personal and professional accomplishments.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I worked in Vietnam right after it reopened, negotiating the first bilateral trade agreement and textile agreements that opened its economy to the world and helped them in their bid to join the World Trade Organization. These were absolutely transformational. The achievements we made in opening up that country and helping them engage in a more fulsome way in the world is one of my greatest achievements.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These, and many other significant professional successes, earned her the Joint Meritorious Civilian Service Award from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and multiple State Department performance awards. They also elevated her nomination for the post of ambassador, the highest ranking diplomatic official.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2><strong>Lessons Learned in UCSC Classrooms&#160;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her work with leaders of countries, dignitaries and people in prominent political positions has been made easier, says Pierangelo, because of her ability as a student to easily interact with faculty at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I learned how to not be afraid of authority. The educational model at UC Santa Cruz allows for so much interaction with professors. Our small classes presented opportunities to really get to know the professors. They would join us for coffee after class where we&#8217;d continue the classroom dialogue and get to know them and their personal stories.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She recalls one professor who, during a youth revolution, escaped Hungary by walking over the mountains to Switzerland; another invited the class to his home for an authentic Indian meal.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The beauty in UC Santa Cruz is the promised difference in the approach to education. It instilled a love of learning, a love of life and a love of conversation in me. It gave me the ability to discuss freely, in a way that would not have happened if I had been sitting in a classroom of 400 students doing rote work.&#8221;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<br/>
<h2><strong>The Journey to the Highest-Ranking Diplomatic Post</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The road to the confirmation was quite lengthy; the process began nearly two years ago. Upon approval from the State Department, her application underwent an extensive vetting process at the White House. In June of 2021, President Biden announced his intent to nominate Pierangelo to replace Michael Pelletier to the ambassador post. In September she appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and it reported favorably in October. Her nomination was presented to the U.S. Senate for confirmation, which was approved on March 2, 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has been serving in West Africa since 2019, assisting Nigerian companies seeking U.S. partners; however, her new post, overseeing U.S. diplomatic relations on the islands of Madagascar and Comoros, will provide different challenges and opportunities. The two countries are strategically significant for the United States as they sit at the maritime crossroads of the Indian Ocean, Africa and the Atlantic Ocean. In addition, the largest deep-water port is situated at the northern tip of Madagascar. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is much less infrastructure and political stability in these countries than there is in Nigeria,&#8221; said Pierangelo. &#8220;The region is threatened by climate change, which is creating serious humanitarian, economic, and environmental crises.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stated in her Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that extended drought in Southern Madagascar has created food insecurity and internal migration that threatens unique ecosystems, and COVID-19 has exacerbated health and economic challenges. Her work will focus on providing basic healthcare, primary education and emergency food aid, as well as addressing economic development and wildlife trafficking and corruption. She also plans to work with the Peace Corps to resume its historically vibrant programs in the two countries.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pierangelo, who will oversee more than 400 foreign service employees in her new role,&#160; will be sworn in as Ambassador to the Republic of Madagascar and the Union of the Comoros on May 2, 2022.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4d11abec8072704664be42b430fc3758"><name>ibsc-nichd-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells awarded $1M training grant for postdoctoral researchers</title><summary>The directors of the Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells brought in a new $1M training grant for postdoctoral researchers, and have been awarded over $12M in grants in just two years.</summary><start-date>1650524400000</start-date><path>/2022/04/ibsc-nichd-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/ibsc-nichd-grant</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1650560445395</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1651002918296</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Feature</value><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/camilla-lindsay-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/camilla-lindsay-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>camilla-lindsay-500.jpg</name><display-name>camilla-lindsay-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>74782</file-size><width>500</width><height>317</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Camilla Forsberg and Lindsay Hinck, co-directors of the IBSC.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/camilla-lindsay-80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/camilla-lindsay-80.png</link><site>news</site><name>camilla-lindsay-80.png</name><display-name>camilla-lindsay-80.png</display-name><file-size>12693</file-size><width>80</width><height>51</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Camilla Forsberg and Lindsay Hinck, co-directors of the IBSC.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>Camilla Forsberg and Lindsay Hinck, co-directors of the Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells, have brought in more than $12 million in grants for the Institute in two years.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>With the new award, IBSC directors have now brought in nearly $12 million to fund the future of bimolecular research at UCSC 
</article-subhead><article-text><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As academic researchers, UC Santa Cruz Professors Camilla Forsberg and Lindsay Hinck push the frontiers of stem cell biology by looking for unexplored areas of their fields. They bring this same innovative spirit to their roles as directors of the <a href="https://ibsc.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s2">Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells</span></a> (IBSC), searching for untapped areas that can be enhanced within the academic research infrastructure.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This drive led them to focus on bringing in grants to support postdoctoral researchers, and their efforts have been remarkably successful. The latest example is a $1 million training grant from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) that will expand the IBSC&#8217;s support for postdoctoral scientists.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Postdocs bring mature research ideas to the university, but in the past they have largely lacked a robust infrastructure to support them. To provide more support and career development opportunities for these scholars, the IBSC has received grants from four other sponsors over the past two years, in addition to the NICHD grant.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The IBSC has also received funds for predoctoral and undergraduate training programs &#8212; in total Forsberg and Hinck&#8217;s fundraising efforts will provide nearly $12 million in extramural funding for training programs. This funding will shape the future of the IBSC, which brings together more than 30 laboratories across the Engineering and Physical and Biological Sciences divisions, as well as the <a href="https://scijust.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s2">Science &amp; Justice Research Center</span></a>.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We really wanted to make an effort to elevate everyone's capacity for doing more research,&#8221; said Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;Postdocs are great because they already have a Ph.D., and they come with mature ideas and ambition. They bring a whole new dimension to our research and help us both innovate and train more junior students.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The four other funding institutions include the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), which provides graduate and postdoctoral funding; the NIH-funded Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Award (IRACDA), which supports a partnership with local California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) to train academic-minded post-doctoral fellows; the UC Office of the President <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/graduate-studies/initiatives-outreach/uc-hsi-ddi.html"><span class="s2">Hispanic Serving Institutions Doctoral Diversity Initiative</span></a>; and the Genentech Foundation-sponsored Academic Inspiration Network (GAIN) program that builds on the partnership with CSUMB.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We didn't set out to have five training programs, but then there were more opportunities, so we kept pitching our basic mentoring philosophies to different funders,&#8221; Forsberg said. &#8220;Now we have five different programs. I guess we found a secret sauce that made our funders excited.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their unique approach is manifested in their devotion to forming strong peer connections amongst a group of talented postdoctoral researchers, using strategies for strengthening the research endeavors at all levels of activity on campus, and creating outside relationships with companies that expose postdocs to industry jobs. The programs aim to connect cohorts of trainees who can interact and network through the IBSC in order to form a peer support ecosystem, rather than being siloed in individual labs.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through spending time in career training workshops, postdocs have the opportunity to gain feedback not just from their supervisors but from additional faculty and their peers. This helps to create a sense of belonging, which is especially important for underrepresented researchers. The IBSC strives to build cohorts that welcome and foster diverse perspectives for the betterment of scientific endeavors.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To this end, the IBSC will host families on campus this summer for a pilot&#160; program that aims to demystify the oftentimes lengthy path through academia to a research career. The event will include poster sessions and short talks that distill the essence of stem cell research and science career paths.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the directors&#8217; main focus is advancing stem cell research, they are also committed to&#160; fostering other areas of biomolecular research, as allowed by the specifications of the grant funders. One such area is the exploration of ethical questions in stem cell research, and the directors are collaborating with mentors and trainees at the UCSC Science &amp; Justice Research Center to do so.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the new NICHD grant, Forsberg and Hinck hope to provide robust support for a cohort of postdoctoral scholars, including those who are interested in the biotech industry. Collaboration with a panel of industry advisors will create shadowing opportunities for the trainees to learn outside of the academic environment. The biotechnology advisors will offer career development advice about entrepreneurship to help scholars navigate either a collaborative relationship with industry as part of an academic career or a career in industry itself &#8212; whichever makes the most sense for the individual.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It's a great two-way training,&#8221; said Hinck, professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology. &#8220;Because we are in academia, our scholars have the freedom to investigate wide-ranging hypotheses free from commercial concern. Our industry collaborators are very appreciative of the biological insights our trainees have to offer.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Partnerships were formed through personal connections of the two directors and include biotech companies such as <a href="https://www.jaspertherapeutics.com/"><span class="s2">Jasper Therapeutics</span></a> and <a href="https://www.roche.com/"><span class="s2">Roche</span></a>, with the aim of further expanding this network in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pre- and postdoctoral trainees supported by these training grants can be hosted by a number of labs in the IBSC and beyond. The training programs were developed in consultation with a number of colleagues, most importantly IBSC program director Catharina Lindley and Aparna Sreenivasan, the lead collaborator at CSUMB. The team also drew on the substantial experience of John Boothroyd, professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, who shared key insights from developing similar programs for Stanford trainees.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Forsberg and Hinck are reaching out to additional faculty colleagues to bring fresh ideas to the Institute and its members, and to help stay up to date about the newest pedagogy in doctoral and postdoctoral training. Because mentoring norms and best practices continuously evolve, all mentors in the program must participate in annual mentorship training. As part of purposeful mentoring, all trainees are expected to create individual development plans &#8212; a living, breathing document for mentees to reflect on and understand their goals, and, with their mentors, map out their paths to success.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">&#8220;The key thing about all these training programs is that they implement new ideas about structured graduate and postdoctoral training," Hinck said. </span><span class="s1">&#8220;While getting a training grant position is competitive, we try to make the structured training provided by the grants </span><span class="s3">widely available</span><span class="s1"> so that all graduate students and postdoctoral scholars at UCSC can increase their skill sets. The environment that's built around these training programs elevates opportunities for everyone.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="53242b748072704664be42b41d9fa145"><name>covid-19-campus-community-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>COVID-19: Community Update</title><summary>As UC Santa Cruz continues to monitor COVID-19 transmission rates, the community is reminded of the importance of engaging in ongoing mitigation efforts. </summary><start-date>1650610800000</start-date><display-name>COVID-19: Community Update</display-name><path>/2022/04/covid-19-campus-community-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/covid-19-campus-community-update</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1650662320987</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1650664706390</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Date:</strong> April 22, 2022</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>To:</strong> UC Santa Cruz students, staff, and faculty</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>From:&#160;</strong>Gary Dunn, PhD, interim Associate Vice Chancellor, Student Health and Wellness, and Elizabeth Miller, DO, Student Health Services Medical Director</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Subject:</strong> COVID-19: Community update</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear UC Santa Cruz Community,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are writing today to address increasing COVID transmission rates on our campus and in the surrounding community. In the past week, our campus seven-day positivity rate increased from 1 to 3.66 percent. Santa Cruz County rates also increased, though not as significantly.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we are mindful of the rise in positive cases, we remain encouraged that the vast majority in our community are up to date on their vaccines and thus far there has been little COVID-19 spread in our workplaces and classrooms. Still, the current rates require our continued attention and action. At this time, we wish to remind the community of the importance of engaging in ongoing COVID-mitigation efforts:</span></p>
<p><strong>We strongly recommend masking indoors. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though masking is no longer required in most campus spaces, we continue to strongly recommend the use of face masks indoors. Because masking remains an effective tool against the transmission of COVID-19 and many other illnesses, free surgical and KN-95 masks continue to be available for pick up at </span><a href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various campus locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><strong>Please note the following spaces and circumstances require masking at all times:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Masking is required in UC Santa Cruz clinical settings (e.g., Student Health Services and COVID-19 testing sites) and while riding campus transit vehicles.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">As well, per <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-on-Isolation-and-Quarantine-for-COVID-19-Contact-Tracing.aspx">California Department of Public Health</a>, anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 or is known to be a close contact of a COVID-19 positive individual, must wear a mask for 10 days.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We encourage you to engage in regular COVID-19 testing. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz continues to offer </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html#Testing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free, on-campus testing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for students, staff, and faculty. In accordance with the </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html#:&#126;:text=Spring%20Quarter%202022,%2C%20staff%2C%20or%20students)."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Testing Protocol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, community members who are not up to date on their vaccinations are required to test every four days. Community members who are up-to-date may test as desired but are encouraged to do so regularly &#8212; especially if you have been exposed to COVID-19 or have a chronic medical condition.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>We suggest practicing healthy hygiene and COVID-cautious habits. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it&#8217;s safe to do so, the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/improving-ventilation-home.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC advises opening doors and windows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as much as you can to bring in fresh, outdoor air when you plan to gather indoors with others. Additionally, continue to practice good hand hygiene, refrain from sharing food or beverages, cover your coughs and sneezes, and, if you have COVID-19 symptoms, please stay home and contact your local health-care provider for guidance. Symptomatic students should contact the Student Health Services Nurse Advice Line </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">831-459-2591) during business hours</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to schedule a COVID-19 test. Employees should stay home and contact their primary-care physician for follow-up. If you test positive for COVID-19, please </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">immediately isolate, and follow the </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/covid_positive_directions_students.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 Positive Test Result Instructions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We appreciate your continued support for our community through your response to COVID-19. Our collective efforts are essential to minimizing transmission rates. That said, we will continue to closely monitor local transmission rates and will update the community about significant changes that impact the testing protocol or community actions like indoor masking.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, let&#8217;s continue to be mindful of this moment and do our parts to stop the spread of COVID-19. We&#8217;re all in this together, Slugs!</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In community,</span></p>

(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Please be aware that spring is the prime birthing season for a wide variety of campus wildlife, including deer.</p>
<p>Finding a fawn (baby deer) alone in the woods or a meadow is fairly common. Many people assume that young wildlife found alone are abandoned, helpless and need assistance for their survival. In nearly all cases this is a mistake, and typically human interaction does more damage than good. If you see a fawn or other newborn wildlife, enjoy your encounter, but for the animal&#8217;s well being, it is important to keep the encounter brief and maintain some distance.</p>
<p>A fawn's best chance of survival lies in being raised by its mother. Fawns nurse three to four times a day, usually for less than thirty minutes at a time, but otherwise the doe keeps her distance. This helps reduce the chances that she will attract a predator to the fawn. The fawn's protective coloration, near lack of scent and ability to remain motionless all help it avoid detection by predators and people.</p>
<p>If you find a fawn you should not approach it and by no means touch it or pick it up. The mother will most likely return to claim it. If you feel that the animal is in harms way, maintain a substantial distance while still being able to observe it and contact the <strong>campus police department 459-2231</strong> or <strong>county </strong><strong>Animal Control: <span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;">831-454-7227</span>. <br/> </strong></p>
<p>In addition to potentially harming a fawn, state and federal laws forbid possession of game and many non-game animals, so adopting newborn wildlife is usually illegal. If a fawn has been "rescued" when it shouldn't have been, it can often be released at the same location. Parents tend to remain in the area for at least a day, looking for the lost youngster.</p>

They will use the funds to develop a program that provides valuable drone pilot skills, certification, and field experience that lead to employment for students in the underserved Salinas and Pajaro Valley regions.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CIDER is a program within <a href="https://citris.sites.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s2">CITRIS and the Banatao Institute at UCSC</span></a> that brings together students and stakeholders to develop a diverse drone workforce. The grant is shared with university partners at the <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s2">Institute for Social Transformation</span></a> and the <a href="https://mesa.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s2">MESA program</span></a>, and external partners, <a href="https://www.hartnell.edu/"><span class="s2">Hartnell College</span></a> and <a href="https://digitalnest.org/"><span class="s2">Digital Nest.&#160;&#160;</span></a></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;This generous grant will allow us to deepen our ties with our partners in Salinas and the Pajaro Valley,&#8221; UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a wonderful opportunity to share the transformational power of a UC Santa Cruz education, providing critical and tangible workforce development skills for a growing industry.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The planning grant will allow the partner organizations, under the leadership of CIDER Director Becca Fenwick and Associate Director Justin Cummings, to develop a program that will target communities historically underserved and underrepresented in STEM. It will establish an educational and training pathway for students as well as new and incumbent workers in the Salinas and Pajaro valleys. The James Irvine Foundation has identified Salinas as one of its priority cities and is supporting </span><span class="s3">community-based programming to develop an economy that works for all residents in the region.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">&#8220;To achieve our vision of an economy that works for all residents, the Priority Communities initiative supports local efforts to create good jobs and more equitable economies. We are thankful for the critical leadership, partnership, and collaboration between UC Santa Cruz CITRIS CIDER, Hartnell College, and Digital Nest,&#8221; said The James Irvine Foundation Priority Communities Initiative Director, Jessica Kaczmarek. &#8220;This is a key opportunity to support the expansion and diversification of quality drone-related employment and access to those jobs for the residents of the Salinas Valley and Pajaro Valley.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aerial drone technology has experienced explosive innovation in the past five years. This innovation has reduced the cost of drones and increased their use in many key local industries, including agriculture, construction, forestry and conservation. Drones have also become a transformative factor in scientific research, revolutionizing the means of data acquisition and types of data available to researchers in many fields.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It is wonderful to see that, thanks to the generous support from partners like The James Irvine Foundation, our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion in CITRIS and CIDER in particular is resulting in such great opportunities&#160; to serve communities that are underserved and underrepresented in STEM,&#8221; said JJ Garcia-Luna-Aceves, Campus Director of CITRIS and the Banatao at UC Santa Cruz.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result of the expanding application of drone technology, there is increasing demand for skilled operators. Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) and women have been historically excluded from science, engineering, technology and math (STEM) fields and careers. So, with the expansion of drone applications, it is essential that training opportunities target communities historically excluded from STEM so they can apply these skills in their current professions, find new opportunities, and help increase diversity in this emerging workforce.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We at Hartnell are enormously grateful for our partnership with UC Santa Cruz and the support of The James Irvine Foundation,&#8221; said Erica Padilla-Chavez, president of the Hartnell Community College District Governing Board. &#8220;It&#8217;s crucial that our students understand how drones work and be ready to apply their many benefits in a wide variety of STEM-related careers, especially within the Salinas Valley ag industry.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Digital NEST will collaborate with CIDER to offer high school aged youth from our Watsonville, Salinas and Gilroy locations a high quality experience focused on an experiential STEM curriculum that includes hands-on engineering concepts and done operations. Additionally, the Digital NEST will have access to college aged role models and peer mentors.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We are excited to be in partnership with UCSC to provide our youth exposure to the many opportunities Drone specialized careers can offer, especially for our youth who are interested in&#160; initiating their professional careers close to home, contribute to the local economy, and strengthen their community,&#8221; commented Dr. Antonia O. Franco, Chief Operating Officer of Digital Nest.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The connection to The James Irvine Foundation and the many partner organizations that led to this grant was facilitated by the new UCSC <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/hub-announcement.html"><span class="s2">Innovation and Business Engagement Hub</span></a>, a valuable campus-wide resource for connections to potential industry partners and supporters.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The CIDER program at UCSC provides guidance and leadership around the use of drones on campus in a variety of ways.&#160; They coordinate research opportunities and support data acquisition for campus researchers across disciplines. Diverse student cohorts have the opportunity to master the operation of drones and associated sensors through various programs put on by CIDER, and those students are supported in the completion of their <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/become_a_drone_pilot/"><span class="s2">FAA Part 107 commercial drone pilot certification</span></a>.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The program also works to foster professional development through employment opportunities for students by working with industry partners to provide internship and employment opportunities. They also secure contracts with both campus and external organizations to fly drone missions, which provide students with paid field training opportunities.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="61f5d0758072704664be42b4d3351ed0"><name>tree-planting-funding-questions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>10 questions all funders should ask before supporting tree-planting campaigns</title><summary>Environmental Studies Professor Karen Holl is concerned that widespread enthusiasm for tree-planting may be leaving restoration best-practices by the wayside.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, as the impacts of climate change have become more pronounced, tree-planting has frequently been touted as a &#8220;natural climate solution&#8221; to capture and store planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions while also conserving biodiversity and improving quality of life for people.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Studies Professor Karen Holl, who has been studying forest restoration for almost three decades, can attest to the importance of protecting existing forests and restoring tree cover where it has been lost. But true forest restoration is a complex endeavor that requires careful planning and long-term maintenance and investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holl and her frequent research collaborator, Professor Pedro Brancalion at the University of S&#227;o Paulo in Brazil, have become concerned that widespread fervor for tree-planting may be leaving restoration best-practices by the wayside. Tree-planting efforts have grown to fad proportions, with large-scale organized campaigns, carbon offset credits, corporate responsibility pledges, and individual donors all contributing to a largely unregulated global undertaking.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are billions of dollars being dedicated to this, and if we want to realize positive outcomes, it is important to think carefully about where all of that money is going,&#8221; Holl said. &#8220;Otherwise, the risk is that we could be wasting money on projects that will either fail or, worse, have harmful effects.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why Holl and Brancalion </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332222001567?dgcid=author"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the following set of research-based questions that all potential funders should ask before deciding to support a reforestation campaign:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you hope to achieve by growing trees?&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do the proposed tree growing strategies match those goals?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How have the initial drivers of deforestation and forest degradation been assessed and resolved?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are local stakeholders involved in the project?&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What benefits will they receive?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will potential negative consequences of the project be minimized?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will the project be maintained and supported after the first few years?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will the outcomes of the project be monitored and guide adaptive management?&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the outcomes of prior tree growing efforts overseen by this organization?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will the funding be allocated across organizational scales?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the questions are designed to ensure that funders appropriately weigh the risks and benefits of projects. Planting trees in the wrong places can reduce limited water supply and destroy other types of biodiverse ecosystems, like grasslands and savannas. And initiating projects without appropriate engagement and buy-in from local communities may lead to social conflict, lost income, and displacement of people, which can actually increase deforestation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when projects go right, there are usually trade-offs among goals like carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and benefits to local stakeholders, which is why it&#8217;s important to have a clear vision early on. Funders must also be realistic about what tree-planting can accomplish.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everyone wants to plant our way out of climate change, but trees are not a substitute for the need to make large and rapid reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions,&#8221; Holl said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holl and Brancalion also want to make sure that tree-planting groups are planning for the long term. Research shows that poorly-planned tree-planting efforts often fail to produce desired benefits because the trees don&#8217;t survive long enough. So, instead of measuring impact by the number of trees planted, projects should set targets for how many trees will be alive in five, 10, or 20 years, and then collect data on the results. This type of monitoring is essential to identifying and correcting issues as tree-planting efforts continue to grow in scale.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of organizations leading these projects has grown rapidly too, and not all have the same level of experience or qualifications. Some of the recommended questions can help funders get a better sense for the track record of organizations they&#8217;re considering supporting. Often, a large global intermediary organization secures funding for smaller implementing organizations, in which case it&#8217;s also important to understand how funding is distributed, to ensure that local stakeholders will be sufficiently compensated.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holl has asked these questions for herself while serving on advisory boards for investment groups and environmental organizations. She and her students are also starting to systematically evaluate how well different tree growing organizations can answer them. If others start asking these questions too, she hopes that funding for forest restoration projects can be put to its most productive uses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m always looking for organizations to clearly state their goals, to have a long-term plan, and to tell me how their project is stakeholder-led,&#8221; she said. &#8220;These are all questions that organizations should be able to answer, and that is a key to success.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="62a0882d8072704664be42b45287106f"><name>drive-safely</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Drive safely with increased pedestrian activity on campus Tuesday, April 26</title><summary>UAW 2865, the labor union that represents UC academic student employees and graduate student researchers, has announced that it will hold a march at 3 p.m. Tuesday, April 26.</summary><start-date>1650870000000</start-date><display-name>Drive safely with increased pedestrian activity on campus Tuesday, April 26</display-name><path>/2022/04/drive-safely</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/drive-safely</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1650922129419</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1650922129419</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>UAW 2865, the labor union that represents UC academic student employees and graduate student researchers, has announced that it will hold a march at 3 p.m. Tuesday, April 26.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the previous two editions of Alumni Week were mostly virtual, but this one included many opportunities to meet and greet in person, including a gala kickoff event for alumni in downtown Santa Cruz at the Museum of Art &amp; History (MAH).</span></p>
<p><strong>Keeping up with COVID&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slugs pride themselves on their blend of excellence and social consciousness. That combination was very much in evidence at a virtual </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/university_forum_featuring_julia_calderone_nicholas_st_fleur"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University Forum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday highlighting the work of three alumni of UCSC&#8217;s prestigious Science Communication Program who cover the COVID-19 pandemic. The panelists, </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/pulitzer-alumna.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julia Calderone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ('14 SciCom), </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/08/stfleur-award.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicholas St. Fleur</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ('14 SciCom), and Nsikan Agpan ('14 SciCom), who was </span><a href="https://nypublicradio.org/2021/01/04/wnyc-names-nsikan-akpan-health-and-science-editor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">named in January 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as health and science editor at WNYC public radio in New York, addressed the challenge of covering a crisis that also affects them personally.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calderone, a staff editor at the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New York Times,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was among a large team of reporters and editors honored on June 11 with the </span><a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/new-york-times-6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The award, regarded as the most prestigious of the annual Pulitzer Prizes in journalism, recognized a </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/2021-pulitzer-coronavirus-coverage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deep package of 15 stories and data-analysis displays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the coronavirus pandemic assembled in 2020 by the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calderone was tapped to work on the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8217;s COVID tracking project in spring of 2020.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it would be an exaggeration to say that those were some of the darkest and most humbling and rewarding moments of my life,&#8221; said Calderone.</span></p>
<p><strong>Considering climate change&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/prestigious_international_scholarships_reception"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confronting Climate Change Conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Thursday brought together scientists, artists, policy experts, and community members to discuss the planet&#8217;s wellbeing and share solutions for the future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference kicked off with panelist presentations about how climate change is affecting the Santa Cruz County community through sea level rise, storm intensity, water supply, fishery health, and food production.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katherine Seto, assistant professor of environmental studies, spoke of the complex ways that climate change can impact fisheries across the globe. Small Pacific Island states have economies that depend on their commercial fisheries, but warming waters have driven many tuna to migrate toward open waters, away from island jurisdiction, Seto said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of that migration, places like Santa Cruz are expected to see an increase in tuna stocks.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But when that happens, those small island nations will no longer be entitled to the revenue, which in some cases is 84 percent of their total government revenue. Things like hospitals, education, and roads, will no longer have the support they need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So when we think about climate change, a lot of times it's easy to think about the direct effects, right?&#8221; Seto said. &#8220;What&#8217;s harder to think about are the indirect and the more complex things like ocean acidification or salt water intrusion, or increasing storm frequency and intensity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel also included Borja Reguero, associate researcher, Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC; Sherry Flumerfelt of Monterey Bay Fisheries Trust; and Valentin Lopez, chairman of the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band.</span></p>
<p><strong>'Art can be a bridge'&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slugs took their time Friday evening enjoying the exhibit </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/strange_weather_alumni_reception_at_the_mah"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strange Weather</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which brings together artworks from the collection of Jordan Schnitzer and his Family Foundation, illuminating and reframing the boundaries of bodies and the environment, with works from renowned contemporary artists.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibit, which runs through August 14, is curated by&#160; Rachel Nelson, director of the&#160; Institute of the Arts and Sciences, in collaboration with Jennifer Gonz&#225;lez, professor of history of art and visual culture. The exhibition is organized by the Institute of the Arts and Sciences and the Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu, dean of the Division of Arts at UCSC, encouraged attendees to lose themselves in the artworks.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You will be frozen in your feet because your mind will be blown,&#8217;&#8217; she said, emphasizing that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strange Weather</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is available to UCSC faculty, staff, and students for no charge.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing the crowd at the kick-off event for the weekend, UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive said the MAH exhibit was a great way to begin the Saturday and Sunday festivities at Alumni Week.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a great place to come together and think about campus and community collaborations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Art can act as a bridge,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;The arts really bring the soul to UC Santa Cruz, especially since Dean Celine joined us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>A fresh look at campus&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most of the activities were earthbound on the weekend of Alumni Week, some Slugs enjoyed breaking free of gravity with some high-flying drones at the </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/drone_flying_demonstration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drone Flying Demonstration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A group of alumni had a blast learning how to fly the buzzing, remote-controlled devices from FAA-licensed undergrads working in the CIDER (CITRIS Initiative for Drone Education and Research) program on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some stopped by for fun, and others because they're thinking about a career change and see the many applications for drone work as a major opportunity. A prospective UCSC robotics student and his father came by and ended up staying for more than an hour. In fact, they were so taken with the drone demonstration that it sealed the deal: The young man is coming to UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Crown College, UCSC Foundation Trustee Henry Chu (Crown '72, history) and Diane (Pearson) Elliot (Crown '73, biology) were attending the Crown College 50th reunion, which featured a conversation around the theme of "Who we are and who we became.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked why he attended the event, Chu said, "A lot of my identity is wrapped around Crown College and UCSC, and a lot of my good friends are from here. There are five of us who hang out together quite frequently, and one of them was the organizer."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that he's also been involved with Crown College as a trustee, and part of the event was intended to encourage alumni to think about the future&#8212;especially Crown's&#8212;and consider making gifts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elliot&#8212;who met her husband, Robert Elliott (Crown '72, psychology), at orientation during their first week of college&#8212;heard about the 50th reunion through Robert's college roommate, Mark Alexander (Crown '74, information sciences).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We decided it would be kind of fun to come back and see things again," Elliot said. "I don't know what I expected, but it's been really interesting to see where people have gone in the last 50 years."</span></p>
<p><strong>Alumni reconnecting, changing the world</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Cowell Coffee Shop's Saturday event, </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/cultivating_food_access_and_student_success_at_the_cowell_coffee_shop"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultivating Food Access and Student Success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Cowell Coffee Shop Supervisor Brooks Schmitt (Porter '12, classical studies and world literature) explained how the caf&#233; employs 13 students and 30 interns, and serves 200&#8211;300 students a day with free, nutritious food in part through the University of California's Basic Needs Initiative.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We're trying to create this visualization of what the food system is and how students fit into it, and then also address food security at the same time," Schmitt said, adding that 80 percent of the caf&#233;'s produce comes from the campus Farm, with the other 20 percent coming from the farmer's market.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cynthia Hernandez-DeLuca (Oakes '99, molecular, cellular and developmental biology) of Milpitas made it to Alumni Week for the first time this year and was attending the </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/lals_alumni_gathering"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin American and Latino Studies Alumni Gathering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;she had been interested in Latin American and Latino studies as a student but didn't get much of a chance to explore it&#8212;and then planned to head to the </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/oakes_college_welcome_back_bbq_celebrating_the_classes_of_20_and_21"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakes College Welcome Back BBQ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if she ran into old friends and acquaintances, and to possibly network.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Saturday's dynamic list of events wrapped up, Sterling Scott (Rachel Carson '17, molecular, cellular and developmental biology) was getting a chance to unwind at the </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/annual_beer_and_wine_reception"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheers to 30 Years! Alumni Reception &amp; Reunion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Cowell courtyard. Scott, who was part of the founding class of </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/01/focus-on-africa.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (FOA), was invited by FOA's leadership to speak at the group's event, </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/merrill_college_focus_on_africa_reunion_2014d2022#.Ymcq3PPMI2I"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill College: Focus on Africa Reunion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, earlier in the day. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"They wanted me to be back and speak on my experience and how it's changed my life. It really opened my eyes and changed my perspectives on a lot of things and how I see the world and interpret what we go through, and it's opened so many doors," Scott said. "I'm hoping to continue opening those doors for other UCSC students to get involved with the global classroom."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6bfeacc18072704664be42b4c5dae7c8"><name>performance-evaluations-approaching</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>21/22 Annual Performance Evaluations coming due</title><summary>Managers/supervisors should complete the annual evaluations for their non-represented and represented staff to build on our culture of engagement, to provide ongoing support and encouragement and to document any performance concerns that may exist.&#13;

During the pandemic, this passion far outside his professional area of study evolved as he became an avid bird watcher, even using spectral analysis to identify how many distinct baby bird chirps could be distinguished from a nest in his garden.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, when de Alfaro learned in the fall of 2021 that there was a new faculty member, Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies <a href="https://ocamponata.wixsite.com/nocampopenuela"><span class="s2">Natalia Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela</span></a>, coming to UC Santa Cruz who studied birds, he reached out to offer his help if her research ever needed a computer science component. As it turned out, her aim to create large-scale maps of bird habitats was in need of computer science expertise.</span></p>

</figure>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since their initial connection, the two researchers have begun a new collaboration to use machine learning models to create continent-wide maps of bird habitat connectivity for conservation purposes, and they have recently received a $60,000 Google Research Scholar award to fund this work.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela is a conservation ecologist who studies how habitat quality and availability affects extinction risk among the roughly 4,000 species of birds in South America. She had always dreamed of developing large-scale maps of habitat connectivity that would show how birds can move across these landscapes and where connections between habitats could be restored for many species simultaneously. But she had run into a roadblock with available modeling methods.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The problem is scale,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When you want to model habitat connectivity for many species at once, or do it at a continental or national scale, then the current models are not able to handle the data computationally. They just kind of break.&#8221;</span><span class="s3">&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, recent advances in machine learning technology have made it possible to process large amounts of data at once. By taking advantage of the computational power of graphical processing units and expressing algorithms in a way that allows for many images to be compared pixel-by-pixel in a parallelized fashion, de Alfaro believes that the team can create mathematical models faithful to bird movement behavior, and do so much faster than previous methods have allowed.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Imagine mapping continents at the scale of 10 meters, and then you&#8217;re figuring out how these habitats are connected one to another at that same scale,&#8221; de Alfaro explained. &#8220;Computer science has evolved some of the tools to precisely process these very large amounts of data in parallel. And this has been chiefly in machine learning, image processing, and image recognition specification.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With help from these methods, the team will first analyze map and satellite data, including from Google Earth imagery, to take a close look at habitat quality factors like land cover, elevation, and human land use at much finer resolutions than have previously been possible. Then, they&#8217;ll compare this with data on the mobility of South America&#8217;s bird species to get a sense for the distribution of available habitats and which of those are functionally connected.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The resulting product will be a new open-source habitat connectivity algorithm that will power a decision-support tool for conservationists. The team plans to create an interactive map of South America that will flag priority conservation areas&#8212;where existing habitats that are essential to many bird species can be protected&#8212;and priority restoration areas, where bringing back connections between habitats could benefit the most bird species.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To test the algorithm and interactive mapping tools, the team will first apply them on a smaller scale to develop habitat connectivity models for birds in California and within Colombia, where the researchers are already familiar enough with the terrain and species to be able to verify the modeling results. Then, they can work to expand their models to continent-wide scale.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So far, the development process has been a great example of interdisciplinary collaboration, with ecological theory informing which machine learning techniques are applied. And UCSC students are an integral part of this work. Baskin School of Engineering undergraduate computer science students </span><span class="s4">Natalie Valett, Artie Nazarov, Coen Adler, and Jasmine Tai</span><span class="s1"> are currently working side-by-side with the two faculty to build out the code to process satellite imagery and run the computation. And, along the way, the students have learned a lot about conservation and how their studies can be applied for real-world impact.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We would probably move nowhere without Natalia&#8217;s insight, because she is the one that keeps us in check, in terms of whether our results have significance in terms of actual bird movement,&#8221; Nazarov said. &#8220;It's just really awesome how we went from an idea that we need to implement to producing actual, meaningful data in terms of bird movement. It's exciting to see how it will be applied in the real world.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela says that the improved data these models could potentially produce would go a long way toward advancing conservation. The limitations of current habitat connectivity models have meant that conservation management decisions about which habitats to protect or restore may be based on data that are limited to a smaller number of species. A more integrated approach, with more comprehensive data, could identify areas previous models may have missed that are critical to a wider range of biological diversity.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Applying these new techniques to bird conservation is a great place to start, Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela says, and ultimately, those efforts are likely to help many other species too.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Birds are really good indicators of ecosystem health, because they're very sensitive to changes in the ecosystem,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So if you study birds, and if you conserve birds, you're probably conserving a lot of other species that live with them.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The models that the team develops may one day be able to integrate many additional types of species too, which Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela says could benefit the entire field of conservation. De Alfaro also hopes that this work can further a larger pursuit of applying advances in machine learning for the benefit of the natural world. And he&#8217;s excited that this project, still in its early iterative stage, will allow for further interdisciplinary work to help make that vision a reality.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It's not entirely common when you talk with people of different fields that there is both a willingness to collaborate and a project that is available for joint work,&#8221; de Alfaro said. &#8220;This is one of the beautiful coincidences that make work in a university such as UCSC so much fun.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="714535ff8072704664be42b406f309cb"><name>surge-series</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Afrofuturism takes center stage in the Institute of the Arts and Sciencesâ€™ Surge series</title><summary>UC Santa Cruzâ€™s Institute of the Arts and Sciences offers a month-long series of performances and discussions on Afrofuturism, a global artistic and social movement, utilizing the arts, science, and technology to imagineâ€”and createâ€” a world where African-descended peoples and cultures can live and flourish.</summary><start-date>1651129200000</start-date><path>/2022/04/surge-series</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/surge-series</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1651167802857</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1651167802857</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Music</value><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Nina Sazevich</name><title></title><phone/><email>nina@sazevichpr.com</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/surge-series.png</path><link>site://news/2022/surge-series.png</link><site>news</site><name>surge-series.png</name><display-name>surge-series.png</display-name><file-size>4070526</file-size><width>2400</width><height>1600</height></image><image-alt>Men and women dancing on a stage</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/surge-series-copy.png</path><link>site://news/2022/surge-series-copy.png</link><site>news</site><name>surge-series-copy.png</name><display-name>surge-series-copy.png</display-name><file-size>6728</file-size><width>80</width><height>53</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">GERALDCASELDANCE performs </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not About Race Dance </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 8 as part of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surge</span></i></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This May, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences offers a month-long series of performances and discussions on Afrofuturism, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a global artistic and social movement, utilizing the arts, science, and technology to imagine&#8212;and create&#8212; a world where African-descended peoples and cultures can live and flourish.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Surge: Explorations in Afrofuturism</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">spearheaded by a trio of UCSC-affiliated artists: composer/performer Karlton Hester, choreographer Gerald Casel, and artist Aaron Samuel Mulenga.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multidimensional and transcultural </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">music and dance performances, film screenings, and discussions, brings together artists and thinkers to creatively engage and foster the growing Afrofuturist movement for liberation and the restructuring of society free of racism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says Hester, who is a UCSC Professor of Music, the Director of the Digital Arts and New Media MFA Program, and Associate Dean of Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion for the Arts Division, &#8220;There is a kind of &#8216;surge&#8217; taking place in society to which our programming responds. People are increasingly focused on how to heal and transform society, and promote racial justice. By organizing a festival drawing on global Afrofuturist traditions of cultural resistance (and resilience), as conceptualized in the 1950s by cosmic philosopher and jazz giant Sun Ra, we aim to highlight how this intellectual and creative genealogy can help us build a better future for Black people and for all people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hester gathers his jazz ensemble Hesterian Musicism to kick off the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surge</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series May 6 with a dynamic, live performance featuring guest performers Yunxiang Gao, Bill Johnson, Mandjou Kone, Eki'Shola, David Smith, and Siwen Zhao.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A special performance on May 8 organized by Casel, UCSC Associate Professor of Dance and Director of Graduate Studies in Performance, Play &amp; Design, features GERALDCASELDANCE and an all-BIPOC dance ensemble. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not About Race Dance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a collaborative, choreographic response to the unacknowledged racial politics in U.S. postmodern dance.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An online conversation on the histories and futures of African arts, culture, and movements for liberation takes place on May 9 with curator and scholar Ugochukwu-Smooth C. Nzewi and writer and founding editor of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chimurenga </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">magazine, Ntone Edjabe. That same evening, in an original Afrofuturism Hindustani collaboration, there is a live music performance with Indian sitar player Nishat Khan and American jazz saxophonist and composer David Murray.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">World renowned Pamela Z will be in concert at the Rio Theatre in downtown Santa Cruz on May 14. Pamela Z is a composer/performer and media artist working with voice, live electronic processing, sampled sound, and video. A pioneer of live digital looping techniques, she processes her voice in real time to create dense, complex sonic layers. Her solo works combine experimental extended vocal techniques, operatic bel canto, found objects, text, and sampled concrete sounds.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Searching for Freedom with the Afronauts </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is an online conversation May 16 with artists and filmmakers Larry Achiampong, Nuotama Frances Bodomo, and Aaron Samuel Mulenga, one of the organizers and a PhD student in visual studies at UCSC. Inspired by Edward Makuka Nkoloso&#8217;s efforts to establish a Zambian Space Program in the 1960s, the three artists will talk about how imaginings of space travel are utilized in their disparate practices and about the politics and possibilities they find in the creative transcendence of space and time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 22, the series features a dance performance and film screening with Raissa Simpson, director of PUSH Dance Company, and Maurya Kerr, artistic director of tinypistol. Simpson will perform an excerpt of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">EMME YA: Expedition, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">which applies a conceptual underpinning of Afro-technoculture through movement and media. Kerr will be sharing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saint Leroi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a short film about a Black avenging angel come down from on high.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surge</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ends with an evening of dance May 28 by queer Black choreographic duo OYSTERKNIFE (Chibueze Crouch + Gabriele Christian).

It&#8217;s also a silent killer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm#:&#126;:text=The%20most%20common%20symptoms%20of,pass%20out%20or%20kill%20you."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, more than 400 deaths and 20,000 ER visits can be attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning every year. The most common carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning symptoms are headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. Because it mimics the flu, people may experience symptoms without realizing the danger.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While CO detectors and making sure your fireplace and heaters work correctly can help prevent exposure, treatment options are limited for those suffering from CO poisoning. That&#8217;s why Tim Johnstone, an assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, has been interested in creating an easy-to-administer antidote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you are exposed to carbon monoxide, the primary treatment right now is fresh air,&#8221; said Johnstone. &#8220;It is a question of time. In fresh air, you need four to six hours for the level of CO in your blood to be cut in half. With 100% oxygen or hyperbaric oxygen, the half-life shortens further. Even then, the high blood levels of CO can persist long enough to lead to long-term deficits and neurological problems.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnstone </span><a href="https://johnstonelab.wixsite.com/johnstonelab/research"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been studying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the chemistry of CO, which is made of one oxygen atom and one carbon atom joined by a triple bond. In a biological context,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">CO binds to metal centers like the iron in your hemoglobin, which then prevents this protein from functioning as it normally would, transporting oxygen from the lungs to tissues in the rest of the body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To mitigate this, Johnstone has designed small molecules that possess many of the features of the active site of hemoglobin but can bind CO much more tightly than the protein. In a </span><a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/CC/D1CC05542A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent paper published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chemical Communications</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, his group described the ability of one such molecule to bind CO, sequester CO that is already bonded to hemoglobin, and rescue red blood cells exposed to CO, all promising signs for a future antidote. He says these are early results, but the hope is to create a point-of-care treatment that can be administered quickly. Graduate student Daniel Droege has been the point person on this project and has done an excellent job moving this chemistry forward, according to Johnstone.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnstone enjoys mentoring young chemists and using chemicals to solve real-world problems, but he professes to have sought out a faculty position for the simple love of chemistry. &#8220;It&#8217;s immensely fun to make something, set up a reaction, and isolate a product,&#8221; said Johnstone. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to hold a vial of something genuinely new, a molecule that no one has ever made before.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnstone has been teaching at UCSC since 2018. In addition to mentoring graduate and undergraduate student researchers, Johnstone has been a Faculty Fellow with the UCSC Center for Innovation and Teaching Learning (CITL), which has supported his chemical education research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to their research on carbon monoxide poisoning, the Johnstone Lab is also working on antimony-containing drugs used to treat the neglected tropical disease </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leishmaniasis, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing novel arsenic-based anticancer agents, and discovering new main-group bonding motifs. His work has been supported by the Hellman Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and the University of California Cancer Research Coordinating Committee.</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org/events/music-of-the-spheres/">Music of the Spheres</a> and <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org/events/evening-with-the-stars/">Evening with the Stars</a> events are resuming in 2022, with tickets on sale now at <a href="https://ucsctickets.universitytickets.com/w/default.aspx">ucsctickets.com</a>. Additional opportunities to experience Lick Observatory at night are offered through the <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org/events/public-evening-tours/">Public Evening Tours</a> and <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org/events/photography-nights/">Photography Nights</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Some of these events are already sold out, but tickets remain available for many dates throughout the summer. </strong>For dates, additional details, and ticket information, visit <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org/events/">www.lickobservatory.org/events</a>.</p>
<p>Each <em>Music of the Spheres</em> concert features a musical performance and an astronomy lecture by a scientist. Afterward, guests take turns viewing celestial objects through the 36-inch Great Lick Refractor and the 40-inch Nickel Reflector. Guests have additional opportunities to stargaze with small ground telescopes provided by amateur astronomers.</p>
<p>The <em>Evenings with the Stars</em> program gives the public a chance to view through the 36-inch Great Lick Refractor and the 40-inch Nickel Reflector as well. Similar to the <em>Music of the Spheres</em> events, each program features an astronomy lecture by a &#8220;star&#8221; scientist and a history presentation. Amateur astronomers also set up ground telescopes so that guests can get additional telescope time.</p>
<p>The Public Evening Tours offer an expert-guided, four- to six-hour "behind-the-scenes" walking tour of Lick Observatory. Participants can learn about the unique history of the world&#8217;s first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory, the eccentric California pioneer James Lick, technology used for observing on different telescopes along the tour route, and current science being conducted at Lick Observatory. After dark and weather permitting, guests can view celestial objects through the historic 36-inch Great Refractor telescope.</p>
<p>Lick Observatory is located on the summit of Mt. Hamilton in the Diablo Range east of San Jose. Driving time from San Jose is about one hour via Mount Hamilton Road. Founded in 1888, Lick Observatory is at the forefront of astronomical research as an active research facility. It is operated by the University of California Observatories (UCO), a multi-campus research unit that serves eight UC campuses and is headquartered at UC Santa Cruz. More information is available online at <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org/">www.lickobservatory.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Weather may restrict telescope viewings, but other activities will still take place. Due to historic construction of the telescope domes, the 36-inch Great Refractor and the 40-inch Nickel Telescope are not wheelchair accessible at this time. Children must be at least 8 years of age for admission. Due to late hours the program may be difficult for children under 12. <em>Music of the Spheres</em> is for ages 12 and over only.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>09-30-2022</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="72807ee18072704664be42b466527ecc"><name>maysoon-zayid-comedy-night-ucsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Maysoon Zayid to bring incisive hilarity to UCSC for Asian American/Pacific Islander Comedy Night</title><summary>The comedian Maysoon Zayid will perform on campus in the eighth annual Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) Comedy Night at 5 p.m. Saturday, April 30, helping to kick off AAPI Heritage Month.&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comedy Night takes place at the Multipurpose Room at College Nine and John R. Lewis College. Tickets are free but seating is limited so </span><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/an-evening-with-comedian-maysoon-zayid-at-uc-santa-cruz-tickets-262258160217"><span style="font-weight: 400;">register in advance through Eventbrite.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Doors open at 4 p.m.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC&#8217;s AAPI Comedy Night has racked up an impressive lineup of funny people entertaining UCSC students.&#160; In 2020, the comedy night hosted the beloved <em>Saturday Night Live</em> cast member Bowen Yang, who co-stars with Margaret Cho in the upcoming comedy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire Island.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zayid is an actress, comedian, writer, and disability advocate. She is a graduate of and a Guest Comedian in Residence at Arizona State University. She is a Princeton University Arts Fellow for 2021&#8211;23 and will begin two years of teaching and community collaboration in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is also the co-founder/co-executive producer of the New York Arab American Comedy Festival and The Muslim Funny Fest. She was a full-time on-air contributor to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countdown with Keith Olbermann</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a columnist for t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Daily Beast.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She has most recently appeared on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">60 Minutes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ABC News, and Oprah Winfrey Networks <i>In Deep Shift</i>. She had the most viewed TED Talk of 2014 and was named 1 of 100 Women of 2015 by BBC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caz Salamanca, director of the Asian American/Pacific Islander Resource Center at UCSC, spoke about the power and reach of humor and the importance of Comedy Night.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We at AA/PIRC love hosting the annual Comedy Night events because it's an opportunity to introduce our campus community to Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Southwest Asian/North African (AA/PI/SWANA) performers and creators in the entertainment industry,&#8221; Salamanca said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Historically, comedians and performers from our communities are often overlooked or reduced to one-dimensional roles in entertainment, and it's events like this that allow us to support folks within our communities,&#8221; Salamanca said. &#8220;As a Palestinian, Muslim, and disabled woman, Maysoon Zayid brings a very unique perspective through the intersections of her identities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often perspectives on serious or contentious subjects are made to be more easily digestible when presented with comedic insight, Salamanca said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Comedy, when done right, is carefully crafted to be relatable, thought provoking, and fun all at the same time,&#8221; Salamanca said. &#8220;It's our goal to have our attendees feel a sense of community and visibility through laughing with each other.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">magazine, a publication that was founded to elevate people with disabilities, Zayid veered back and forth from being irrepressibly funny to taking on serious matters. She joked about being a shoo-in to win an Oscar, especially since so many actors without disabilities score points for pretending to have them.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Disabilities win awards or at least get you nominated; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rain Man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forrest Gump</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Left Foot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Piano</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born on the Fourth of July</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s Eating Gilbert Grape</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But in all those examples, you have able-bodied [people pretending to have disabilities]. The last time an actor with a visible disability won an Oscar was Marlee Matlin in <em>Children of a Lesser God</em>&#160;[in 1986, for Best Actress]. It&#8217;s time for another PWD [person with disabilities] to grace the Oscar stage, so why not me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maysoon has performed in top New York clubs and has toured extensively at home and abroad. She was a headliner on the Arabs Gone Wild Comedy Tour and The Muslims Are Coming Tour. Zayid appeared alongside Adam Sandler in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You Don&#8217;t Mess with the Zohan</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and has written for</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VICE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also played the character Zahra Amir in the soap opera <em>General Hospital</em> from 2019&#8211;2020, and is the author of Audible's</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Find Another Dream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real-time captioning will be available at this event. If you have a disability-related accommodation for the event, please contact drc@ucsc.edu. Requests should be made as soon as possible to allow time for coordination.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event is co-sponsored by the Disability Resource Center, Womxn's Center, and Center for the Middle East and North Africa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For students who just experienced their first year on campus and aren&#8217;t ready to leave, they can stay for summer in on-campus housing or commute to in-person classes,&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Monica Parikh, director of Summer Session</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Or we still have hundreds of degree requirements online/remote. Wherever they plan to be this summer, we&#8217;ll meet them there.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the summer anyone can take classes at UC Santa Cruz. We welcome visitors from other UC campuses, other colleges, high schools, and community members.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extended again this year, UCSC staff and faculty get half off tuition to encourage professional and personal development.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With most taught in an accelerated five weeks, classes allow ample time to make degree progress and work and have fun this summer.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Bachelor of Arts in Global and Community Health will train students to address social determinants of health, fostering skills that will enable them to serve as future leaders in health care, health policy, public health, and community organizing. And a Bachelor of Science in Global and Community Health will offer two concentration options&#8212;biomedical or public and community health&#8212;that will prepare students for patient-care careers or roles in health administration, public health, and advocacy.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://collegenine.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Nine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is affiliated with the Social Sciences Division, will serve as the administrative home for the degrees, offering a one-stop office for advising, as well as career counseling.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both new majors will begin with a combined intro course, called Foundations for Global and Community Health, that teaches students a shared set of terms, analytical approaches, and frames of reference for health issues from across the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Exposure to these diverse approaches to health will also help students decide which of the B.A. or B.S. pathways best fit their goals and interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students on the B.S. track will focus more heavily on STEM courses that are often required by medical schools and other graduate-level patient-care training programs. Students who choose the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">public and community health concentration will also have opportunities for non-STEM electives. And those on the B.A. track will build health competencies across bio-environmental science, political-cultural contexts, and a mix of quantitative, qualitative, and humanities methods.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the major, students from both degrees will reconvene for a capstone course that invites them to combine their diverse skills and knowledge specializations for a team project, in which they&#8217;ll research the problems and possible solutions around a real-world challenge in global and community health. Professor of Politics Matt Sparke, executive director of the global and community health program, said this kind of interdisciplinary collaboration is needed to address emerging health threats, and UCSC&#8217;s new majors aim to equip students for that future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need an all-hands-on-deck approach to global and community health challenges,&#8221; Sparke said. &#8220;That calls for many disciplines to come together to address these problems, to understand their histories, and to think about ways we can intervene and mitigate the suffering and death that is caused in health crises&#8212;both locally and globally.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Tackling health issues at the source</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new global and community health majors advance a vision of health that works to reduce inequities in an increasingly globalized and interconnected world.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Global forces impact our local health outcomes, so you can't truly understand local health without understanding those forces,&#8221; Sparke said. &#8220;This is not just about the spread of disease globally; it&#8217;s also about the global economic, political, and cultural conditions that can either foster ill-health or well-being.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated many of these forces, Sparke says. Insights from </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/work/covid/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC faculty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other experts around the world revealed how the pandemic&#8217;s impact has been more severe for marginalized and socio-economically vulnerable groups. Wealthier countries also had better access to vaccines, and public health organizations warned that resulting gaps in immunity could allow for continued global spread of COVID-19 and the emergence of new variants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new global and community health majors incorporate lessons like these about how the health prospects of communities are tied to global and local power relations. Students will also learn how human health is based on planetary health and is affected by challenges of the climate crisis, pollution, and species loss. And they&#8217;ll pair a broad global health perspective with understanding of how to imagine and implement solutions at a community level, with the involvement of community partners.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Global health programs are most effectively organized when they include local community ownership and public-sector involvement,&#8221; Sparke said. &#8220;They can&#8217;t be top-down global edicts. They have to be locally meaningful, locally connected, and locally partnered with people, in order to become inclusive and sustainable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new global and community health majors will also encourage a proactive approach to health that considers not just how to treat disease, but how to support elements of well-being that can prevent illness. Anthropology Professor Nancy N. Chen, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an executive committee member for the global and community health majors who leads an affiliated </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/work/gch/global-health-awards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">student fellowship program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, says a crucial element of well-being is a focus on community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People might do everything right&#8212;eating the right things, seeing a health practitioner when they can&#8212;but where we live has a huge influence on our health, including which health services we have access to,&#8221; Chen said. &#8220;We need to be mindful of not just individual actions to take care of ourselves, but how we can take care of each other by making sure that we&#8217;re providing for well-being at a systemic level.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Training tomorrow&#8217;s health leaders</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s long history of research, education, and impact in social justice, biomedical science, community studies, and environmental sustainability positions the campus well to train the next generation of leaders in global and community health. The program will also draw on the campus&#8217;s strengths in interdisciplinary education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty instructors for the program will include influential researchers in health-related fields from across the Physical and Biological Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities Divisions. Students will have opportunities to learn directly from nationally trusted voices on topics ranging from health statistics to globalization and food justice to neglected tropical diseases and cancer and genomics. In recent years, the university has also expanded its base of expertise, with the addition of 11 new global and community health core faculty members who were hired to support the program&#8217;s development.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valerie Cortez, an assistant professor in the Molecular, Cell, &amp; Developmental Biology Department, is one of those core faculty members. She studies viruses that cause diarrheal illness in young children, and she&#8217;ll be teaching a new epidemiology course for the global and community health majors. She was excited to join the program, in part, because her own training in both epidemiology and molecular cell biology instilled in her an appreciation for interdisciplinary education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled that this program is bridging the basic sciences and social sciences, because I think we need more folks who can appreciate both of those perspectives,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Medical tools generated in basic science labs and tech companies can only go so far, and they are best implemented with consideration of people's behaviors and structural barriers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cortez said she&#8217;s looking forward to hearing what questions students have about global and community health and supporting them as they explore career opportunities. Many health-related professions are expected to grow at rates faster than the average for all occupations, according to </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/home.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. UCSC&#8217;s global and community health majors can help meet the need for doctors, nurses, social workers, mental health specialists, public health and policy researchers, community advocates, and more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to educate the next cohort of local, national, and global health leaders in a rigorously interdisciplinary way,&#8221; Sparke said. &#8220;Ultimately, we want to help our students identify multiple pathways for contributing to the health of their communities and to prepare them to be change agents after graduation.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8af37ffc8072704664be42b434b33508"><name>2022-alexa-prize</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Team of researchers win the public benchmark phase of new Alexa Prize competition</title><summary>UC Santa Cruzâ€™s team of computer science and engineering (CSE) Ph.D. students came out victorious by a generous margin during the public benchmark phase of the first-ever Amazon Alexa Prize SimBot Challenge, far surpassing other teams in the university competition focused on advancing virtual assistant technology.&#13;

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this challenge, teams build robots that can execute real-world household tasks like making coffee and cleaning a room, continuously learning from their environment as they do so. Some more complex tasks, such as preparing breakfast, require the robots to perform commonsense reasoning, such as figuring out what to do when there is food in the microwave when it needs to be used. This technology could help bring personal assistants to the market aimed to significantly help older adults and people living with disabilities, as well as the general population.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The UCSC team, called SlugJARVIS, is advised by Assistant Professor of CSE Xin (Eric) Wang and includes six CSE Ph.D. students who all study in Wang&#8217;s <a href="http://eric-lab.soe.ucsc.edu/people"><span class="s2">ERIC lab</span></a>. Wang says the competition aligns perfectly with his research interests of embodied artificial intelligence (robots operating in 3D environments), natural language processing, and computer vision, and creates the opportunity to do novel and impactful work within these areas.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I&#8217;m very proud of my students who are very up to the challenge,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;They are excited about both the research outcomes and the cash prize in the end. This new challenge introduces many unique research problems in embodied AI, and we are eager to explore more along this line of work.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The competition consists of two phases: the public benchmark phase, which began in January and ended Friday, April 29, and the live interaction phase. The team was selected to participate in this challenge in November 2021 after submitting a detailed project proposal, and was awarded a $250,000 grant and additional Amazon Web Services credits.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The SlugJARVIS team programmed their robot to be a helpful at-home robot that can handle a complex learning environment through three main actions. First, the robot breaks a task into manageable subgoals. Next, it creates a semantic map of its environment, keeping track of how the environment may be changing around it. Then, it uses this information to map the subgoals into a detailed plan of action to move through the space and interact with the objects.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the public benchmark phase, the teams&#8217; robot carried out tasks entirely in a virtual, simulated environment. The UCSC team&#8217;s robot has been able to successfully navigate tasks in unknown environments more than 15 percent of the time, while the closest competition has done so about 12 percent of the time.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Team SlugJARVIS will now advance to the live interaction phase of the competition and a chance to win the first-place $500 thousand cash prize. The team plans to travel to Seattle this summer to attend a bootcamp held by Amazon to kick off the second half of the competition.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During this second phase, the robot will interact and talk to a real human, introducing additional natural language processing challenges, as the robot needs to actively ask questions when it needs help and be able to correct course when a human makes a mistake. This means the team will need to add the capability of the robot to carry out dialogue &#8211; as of now it cannot speak.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We spent a lot of time on this challenge and currently we are getting really great results,&#8221; said team leader and Ph.D. student&#160;</span><span class="s3">Jing Gu</span><span class="s1">. &#8220;Everything&#8217;s really exciting &#8211; we hope we can win.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b8f7f14c8072704664be42b4494b8d11"><name>preguntas-antes-de-plantar-arboles</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>10 preguntas que todos los donantes deben hacerse antes de apoyar campaÃ±as para plantar Ã¡rboles</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz Profesora de Estudios Ambientales Karen Holl y el profesor Pedro Brancalion de la Universidad de SÃ£o Paulo en Brasil estÃ¡n preocupados de que el fervor generalizado por plantar Ã¡rboles pueda estar dejando de lado las mejores prÃ¡cticas de restauraciÃ³n. </summary><start-date>1650870000000</start-date><path>/2022/04/preguntas-antes-de-plantar-arboles</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/preguntas-antes-de-plantar-arboles</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1652370698537</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1652370698537</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/seedlings-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/seedlings-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>seedlings-400.jpg</name><display-name>seedlings-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>104164</file-size><width>400</width><height>301</height></image><image-alt>plÃ¡ntulas para campaÃ±as de plantar Ã¡rboles</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/04/images/seedlings-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/04/images/seedlings-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>seedlings-80.jpg</name><display-name>seedlings-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>28591</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>plÃ¡ntulas para campaÃ±as de plantar Ã¡rboles</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>Se utilizan pl&#225;ntulas como estas para campa&#241;as de plantar &#225;rboles que tienen como objetivo brindar una gran cantidad de beneficios ambientales y sociales.

Pero estos esfuerzos requieren una planificaci&#243;n cuidadosa y un mantenimiento e inversi&#243;n a largo plazo para tener &#233;xito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karen Holl, profesora de estudios ambientales en la Universidad de California, Santa Cruz, quien ha estudiado la restauraci&#243;n forestal durante casi tres d&#233;cadas, destaca la importancia de proteger los bosques existentes y restaurar la cubierta arb&#243;rea donde se ha perdido. Pero la verdadera restauraci&#243;n forestal es una tarea compleja.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holl y el profesor Pedro Brancalion de la Universidad de S&#227;o Paulo en Brasil est&#225;n preocupados de que el fervor generalizado por plantar &#225;rboles pueda estar dejando de lado las mejores pr&#225;cticas de restauraci&#243;n. Los esfuerzos para plantar &#225;rboles han crecido y est&#225;n de moda, con campa&#241;as organizadas a gran escala, cr&#233;ditos de compensaci&#243;n de carbono, compromisos de responsabilidad corporativa y donantes individuales, todos contribuyendo a una empresa global en gran medida no regulada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Se est&#225;n dedicando miles de millones de d&#243;lares a esto, y si queremos obtener resultados positivos, es importante pensar cuidadosamente a d&#243;nde se va todo ese dinero&#8221;, dijo Holl. &#8220;De lo contrario, el riesgo es que podr&#237;amos estar desperdiciando dinero en proyectos que fracasar&#225;n o, peor a&#250;n, tendr&#225;n efectos da&#241;inos&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Es por eso que Holl y Brancalion </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332222001567?dgcid=author"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicaron recientemente el siguiente conjunto de preguntas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> basadas en la investigaci&#243;n, que todos los donantes potenciales deber&#237;an hacerse antes de decidir apoyar una campa&#241;a de reforestaci&#243;n:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#191;Qu&#233; espera lograr plantando &#225;rboles?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#191;Las estrategias propuestas de siembra de &#225;rboles coinciden con esos objetivos?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#191;C&#243;mo se han evaluado y resuelto las causas iniciales de la deforestaci&#243;n y la degradaci&#243;n forestal?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#191;C&#243;mo se involucran los actores locales en el proyecto?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#191;Qu&#233; beneficios recibir&#225;n estos actores locales?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#191;C&#243;mo se minimizar&#225;n las posibles consecuencias negativas del proyecto?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#191;C&#243;mo se mantendr&#225; y sostendr&#225; el proyecto despu&#233;s de los primeros a&#241;os?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#191;C&#243;mo se supervisar&#225;n los resultados del proyecto y c&#243;mo se orientar&#225; la gesti&#243;n adaptativa?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#191;Cu&#225;les son los resultados de esfuerzos anteriores de cultivo de &#225;rboles supervisados &#8203;&#8203;por esta organizaci&#243;n?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#191;C&#243;mo se distribuir&#225;n los fondos entre las distintas escalas de la organizaci&#243;n?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algunas de las preguntas est&#225;n dise&#241;adas para garantizar que los que financian los proyectos eval&#250;en adecuadamente los riesgos y beneficios. Plantar &#225;rboles en los lugares equivocados puede reducir el suministro limitado de agua y destruir otros tipos de ecosistemas biodiversos, como praderas y sabanas. Y el inicio de proyectos sin el compromiso y la apropiaci&#243;n de las comunidades locales puede conducir a conflictos sociales, p&#233;rdida de ingresos y desplazamiento de personas, lo que en realidad puede aumentar la deforestaci&#243;n.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incluso cuando los proyectos van bien, por lo general hay que compensar entre objetivos como el secuestro de carbono, la biodiversidad y los beneficios para los actores locales, por lo que es importante tener una visi&#243;n clara desde el principio. Los donantes tambi&#233;n deben ser realistas acerca de lo que se puede lograr plantar con &#225;rboles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Todo el mundo quiere plantar para un escape del cambio clim&#225;tico, pero los &#225;rboles no sustituyen la necesidad de hacer grandes y r&#225;pidas reducciones en las emisiones globales de gases de efecto invernadero&#8221;, dijo Holl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holl y Brancalion tambi&#233;n quieren asegurarse de que los grupos que planten &#225;rboles lo planifiquen a largo plazo. Las investigaciones muestran que los esfuerzos para plantar &#225;rboles mal planificados a menudo no producen los beneficios deseados, porque los &#225;rboles no sobreviven el tiempo suficiente. Entonces, en lugar de medir el impacto por la cantidad de &#225;rboles plantados, los proyectos deben establecer objetivos sobre cu&#225;ntos &#225;rboles estar&#225;n vivos en cinco, 10 o 20 a&#241;os; y luego, recopilar datos sobre los resultados. Este tipo de monitoreo es esencial para identificar y corregir problemas a medida que los esfuerzos para plantar &#225;rboles contin&#250;an escalando.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El n&#250;mero de organizaciones que lideran estos proyectos tambi&#233;n ha crecido r&#225;pidamente y no todas tienen el mismo nivel de experiencia. Algunas de las preguntas recomendadas pueden ayudar a los financiadores a tener una mejor idea del historial de las organizaciones que est&#225;n considerando apoyar. A menudo, una gran organizaci&#243;n intermediaria global asegura el financiamiento para las organizaciones implementadoras m&#225;s peque&#241;as, en cuyo caso, tambi&#233;n es importante comprender c&#243;mo se distribuyen los fondos, para garantizar que las partes interesadas locales reciban una compensaci&#243;n suficiente.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holl se ha cuestionado estas preguntas mientras trabajaba en juntas asesoras de grupos de inversi&#243;n y organizaciones ambientales. Ella y sus estudiantes tambi&#233;n est&#225;n comenzando a evaluar sistem&#225;ticamente qu&#233; tan bien las diferentes organizaciones involucrada en reforestaci&#243;n pueden responderlas. Si otros se preguntan esto tambi&#233;n, ella espera que los fondos para el proyecto de restauraci&#243;n forestal puedan utilizarse lo m&#225;s productivamente.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yo siempre estoy buscando organizaciones que claramente declaran sus metas, que tienen un plan a largo plazo y que me dicen c&#243;mo su proyecto est&#225; dirigido por los actores&#8221;, ella dijo. &#8220;Estas son todas preguntas que las organizaciones deber&#237;an ser capaces de contestar y esa es una clave para el &#233;xito&#8221;.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="c9ec46d6807270462612537c76a1aee8"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>April</title><start-date>1648800000000</start-date><display-name>April</display-name><path>/2022/04/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/04/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1639770244814</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1641091122258</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
