<p>A new approach using molecular biology, analytical chemistry, and bioinformatics to integrate information from different screening platforms addresses some of the biggest challenges in natural products drug discovery, according to a study <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2208458119">published November 30 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>.</p>
<p>A major challenge has been determining the mechanism of action and biological target of a novel bioactive compound. Another central challenge is identifying the molecule or molecules driving biological activity in a complex mixture from nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;These two big concepts have been at the heart of our collaborative program, and this paper brings those two questions together in a fully integrated approach,&#8221; said corresponding author John MacMillan, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In addition to MacMillan, the collaboration involves Scott Lokey, professor of chemistry and biochemistry and director of the Chemical Screening Center at UC Santa Cruz, Roger Linington at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, and Michael White at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.</p>
<p>By integrating the results of two completely different screening platforms and combining this with next-generation metabolomics analysis of their natural products libraries, the researchers created a unique and powerful framework for natural product biological characterization. Using this approach to screen a small collection of randomly selected microbial natural product fractions, they were able to identify a known compound (trichostatin A) and confirm its mechanism of action; link a known compound (surugamide) with novel biological activity (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition); and discover new compounds (parkamycins A and B) with complex biological activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finding a known compound that groups as expected tells us it&#8217;s working, and then we were able to correlate a known compound with a new mechanism of action,&#8221; MacMillan said. &#8220;Finally, we discovered a new chemical compound with a unique biological signature unlike any known compounds. That&#8217;s an exciting finding we want to investigate further.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers used a bioinformatic method called Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), developed for integrating complex datasets, to combine data from two natural product screening platforms their labs had developed. One platform (Functional Signature Ontology, or FUSION), developed by MacMillan&#8217;s lab, uses gene expression signatures induced in cells by known and unknown compounds, coupled with pattern-matching tools to indicate mechanisms of action through &#8220;guilt by association.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we see similar effects to one of those known compounds, that suggests a similar mechanism of action. We have used this technology effectively to understand the biological activity of a number of unique small molecules,&#8221; MacMillan said.</p>
<p>The other platform, a cytological profiling (CP) technology developed by Lokey&#8217;s lab, involves high-content image analysis of cells exposed to the samples being screened and then stained with a panel of fluorescent probes to highlight key cytological features. Automated fluorescence microscopy images yield a total of 251 unique cytological features for each sample.</p>
<p>The researchers used the CP and FUSION technologies to screen complex natural products libraries developed by MacMillan&#8217;s and Linington&#8217;s labs. These libraries were derived from marine bacteria isolated by the two labs.</p>
<p>To search for bioactive natural products, the researchers grow the bacterial strains in the lab, make a crude extract of all the compounds produced by each strain, then use chromatography to separate each extract into a series of fractions, each containing two to 20 compounds.</p>
<p>Mass spectrometry methods are widely used for the large-scale study of small molecules (&#8220;metabolomics&#8221;) and can help identify the chemical constituents of each fraction. An approach called Compound Activity Mapping developed by Linington and others combines mass spectrometry-based metabolomics with biological screening data to identify which compounds in a mixture are driving a particular biological signature.</p>
<p>In the new study, the researchers developed a sample processing workflow using mass spectrometry and a modified version of their Compound Activity Mapping platform that incorporates the integrated results of their screening technologies obtained with Similarity Network Fusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is, can we use all that to pull out the chemicals that are driving a particular signature and make more robust predictions of the mechanism of action? Our approach allowed us to accomplish that in a pretty substantial way,&#8221; MacMillan said.</p>

<p>ASCB&#8217;s Prize for Excellence in Inclusivity recognizes a scientist with a strong track record of cell biology research who has demonstrated the importance of inclusion and diversity in science through mentoring, cultural change, outreach, or community service. The award is made possible by a Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant.</p>
<p>ASCB honored Bhalla on Saturday, December 3, before the keynote of the Cell Bio 2022 meeting in Washington, D.C. She also will write an essay to be published in <em>Molecular Biology of the Cell (MBoC)</em> and will receive $5,000 to use as she chooses.</p>
<p>Susan Strome, distinguished professor of MCD biology at UCSC, strongly recommended Bhalla for her research endeavors and high-impact diversity, equity, and inclusivity actions over the years. For example, Bhalla outlined an actionable plan in her 2019 <em>MBoC</em> Perspective, &#8220;<a href="https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/pdf/10.1091/mbc.E19-08-0476">Strategies to Improve Equity in Faculty Hiring</a>.&#8221; She created an annotated bibliography on best practices for advancing faculty diversity at UCSC. She serves on the ASCB Council and advocates for including speakers from underrepresented groups. Bhalla has also created equity and inclusivity professional development opportunities at the Gordon Research Conferences.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Needhi) is a leader in advocating for appropriate representation of underrepresented groups, and her voice is recognized and sought on the national stage,&#8221; Strome wrote in her letter of support. &#8220;She has been invited to give numerous &#8216;Diversity Outreach&#8217; talks over the last few years and routinely includes discussion of (diversity, equity, and inclusion) issues in her research seminars. She maintains a library of equity-focused books and web links to share with others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social media, however, may be one of Bhalla&#8217;s most prolific and impactful outreach platforms. Soni Lacefield, professor of biology at Indiana University, remarked in her recommendation letter: &#8220;(Needhi) uses Twitter to reach her 13,800 followers to provoke them into thinking about issues of equity and diversity. She points out issues of inequity and how they have hurt scientific progress. She comments on the equity and diversity literature. She calls out racist, sexist, and ableist behaviors. And, she gives concrete ideas on how to implement change. Personally, I have learned more about issues of equity and diversity through following her account than through any other means.&#8221;</p>
<p>A New York native, Bhalla earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree from Columbia College. She obtained her doctorate at UC San Francisco, where she trained with Andrew Murray and studied how mitotic chromosomes segregate in budding yeast. During her postdoctoral training with Abby Dernburg at UC Berkeley, Bhalla identified a meiotic checkpoint that monitors whether chromosomes have synapsed correctly.</p>
<p>Currently, the Bhalla lab combines genetic and biochemical approaches with high-resolution microscopy and cytological techniques in the nematode worm <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> to understand better how chromosomes are partitioned correctly during sexual reproduction (meiosis) and development (mitosis). Having an incorrect number of chromosomes, also called aneuploidy, can lead to cancer, congenital disabilities, miscarriages, and infertility, underscoring the importance of this question to human health, Bhalla explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have integrated equity into all aspects of my work at my university and in my scientific field, including research, teaching, and service,&#8221; Bhalla added. &#8220;I consider this work essential to improve the quality and application of research science.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foundational to all her research endeavors, Bhalla says, is her deep commitment to &#8220;promoting equity in academic science at the level of both trainees and faculty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited and humbled to be recognized by ASCB and my cell biology colleagues for this important work,&#8221; Bhalla said. &#8220;Making science more equitable is essential to improve the quality and application of research science, and I hope this recognition encourages others to consider taking on this work too.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e326c55480727046622461fbc5a8827f"><name>end-of-term-resources-fall-22</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>End of Term Resources</title><summary>Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education and Global Engagement shares a message about end-of-term resources, including a link to frequently asked questions and drop-in zoom advising sessions.</summary><start-date>1669968000000</start-date><display-name>End of Term Resources</display-name><path>/2022/12/end-of-term-resources-fall-22</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/end-of-term-resources-fall-22</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1670258279743</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1670258279743</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>Dear UC Santa Cruz undergraduate students,</span></p>

We have been working on the implementation of the second year of the program. The details of the program and eligibility criteria remain the same as our first year implementation. The effective date for biweekly paid employees is December 25, 2022 and the effective date for monthly paid employees is January 1, 2023. The following outlines the details of the program.</p>
<p><strong>Program Overview and Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The non-represented staff salary equity program will augment other campus salary programs such as annual increases and other equity adjustments. The purpose of this program is to bring employee salaries closer to the market (50th percentile of salary range) over a three-year timeline.</p>
<p>In the first and second year, the program prioritizes employees who are furthest below the midpoint of their respective Career Tracks salary ranges. Equity amounts for eligible employees will vary depending on individual pay circumstances.</p>
<p>The two main factors for consideration are an employee&#8217;s salary range penetration in their respective Career Tracks salary range and years in their current classification. Salary range penetration is a point between 0% - 100% indicating specifically where an employee&#8217;s salary falls within their salary range. Due to differences across employees in these two factors, not all employees will receive the same percentage salary increase, and not every employee will receive an increase.</p>
<p>In our second year, every non-represented staff member below the 75th percentile in pay grades 15 - 25 is eligible for salary adjustment consideration. For the six highest salary grades (26 - 31), only those who are below the 25th percentile are eligible.</p>
<p>This program is not intended to explicitly address existing compression issues, and it does not compound such issues either. If managers have concerns about compression, they should contact their compensation analyst to discuss and address specific issues on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Salary increases will range from 0.18% to 4% of annual pay with the average around 1.3%. About 78% of the approximately 1720 non-represented staff will receive an equity adjustment in the second year of the program. Based on program parameters, 49% of the funds will be distributed to employees at or below the 25th percentile and 42% of the funds will be distributed to employees at or above the 25th percentile and below the 50th percentile. Approximately 95% of the $1.5 million will be distributed to employees in grades 15 through 25.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Non-represented career, partial-year career and contract employees</li>
<li aria-level="1">Employees who have a &#8220;Met Expectations&#8221; performance rating or above for 2021/22 (if an evaluation was not completed, &#8220;Met Expectations&#8221; is assumed)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Employees hired <strong>before</strong> November 1, 2022</li>
</ul>
<p>An important element of this equity initiative is that new hires are expected to be hired no lower than the 25th percentile of the salary grade range. This new practice will help us achieve our objectives of being more competitive. Any exceptions must be reviewed with the compensation team prior to making offers.</p>
<p>Combined with the traditional merit or general increase and traditional equities, this special program is designed to accelerate our progress towards a market-based compensation environment. We will monitor the outcome and implications over time; appropriate modifications to the program will be considered in the third year.</p>
<p><strong>What You Should Expect Next</strong></p>
<p>On December 5, 2022, Principal Officers will receive unit rosters with a list of eligible employees and equity increase percentages determined by compensation. Separately, Budget Analysis and Planning will send information to Principal Officers regarding associated funding opportunities. The equity increase amounts and percentages are established by the program parameters and cannot be adjusted. Eligible employees will be informed of their increases during the week January 9, 2023 after the information has been verified in UCPath. A message similar to this one will be sent directly to employees by email on December 12.</p>
<p>Any equity adjustments the unit would like to consider outside of this program can be submitted beginning January 18, 2023 in consultation with your compensation analyst.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Nov. 16, federal judge Emmet Sullivan blocked </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title42/html/USCODE-2011-title42-chap6A-subchapII-partC-sec252.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the controversial Title 42 immigration policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for five weeks, putting a pause on the Trump policy that allowed U.S. authorities to expel more than 1 million migrants who have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy &#8212;&#160;largely criticized by both public health experts and immigration advocates &#8212;&#160;led to many issues for immigrants seeking asylum from their home countries. Now, migrants could be able to enter the U.S. and make their case for asylum in immigration court; the policy will be on hold until midnight on Dec. 21.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the policy has been in effect since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, launched on March 20, 2020, immigration advocates and groups have been at the frontlines in assisting those seeking asylum in the United States and fighting back against Title 42. One such group is UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s own </span><a href="https://humanrights.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Rights Investigations Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, housed in the Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in fall 2019, the Human Rights Investigations Lab aims to provide virtual support to non-governmental agencies, news outlets and advocates in open source investigations. Founder and director Sylvanna Falc&#243;n &#8212;&#160;who is also an associate professor in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Latin American &amp; Latino/a Studies department &#8212; said the lab&#8217;s work focuses on addressing and confronting human rights violations, with ongoing monitoring of humanitarian, environmental and socio-political crises across the Americas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Title 42&#8217;s implementation, Falc&#243;n said that policy has led to a new level of crisis for those seeking refugee status in the U.S., and its overturn could in a way &#8220;potentially alleviate some of the crises.&#8221; The team has worked with two other organizations, the Human Rights First (Refugee Protection Program) in the U.S. and El Instituto para las Mujeres en la Migraci&#243;n (IMUMI) in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Partly, as sort of a broader and informed public, we had an understanding that Title 42 was impacting migrants in profound ways, but until we did the research, we didn&#8217;t quite know the breadth of the increase in despair,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the group&#8217;s work thus far, HRI Lab&#8217;s findings show Title 42 is in violation of the principle of non-refoulement &#8212;&#160;namely, if an individual asks for asylum at your border, they cannot be sent back to their country where they may face significant harm, violence or death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lorena Hernandez Rivera, a fifth-year undergraduate in the Latin American &amp; Latino/a Studies department, served as the undergraduate team leader for HRI&#8217;s efforts, leading the group of nine students in tandem with a UC Berkeley team from the Human Rights Center. She said that, as a Mexican-American student herself, it was both touching and painful to research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They&#8217;ve made so much effort attempting to come to the U.S., and they face not only U.S. border policy but Mexico border policy, violence from the cartels, migrants attacking other migrants,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was a lot to take in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mireya Curiel, a fifth-year undergraduate in the Latin American &amp; Latino/a Studies department, further said their work went beyond just the border, and impacted the entire country of Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we looked into the research going throughout Mexico and its southern border, it was pretty heavy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Social media was a big tool in finding a lot of these documented incidents.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group used a few specific social media tools as part of their open source methodology to garner more evidence to show the human rights violations associated with Title 42, including Tweetdeck for Twitter, and Crowdtangle for Facebook and Instagram. As Falc&#243;n said, the research revealed that there was not just a one-way passage through Mexico; there is, instead, a global migration happening through Mexico toward the Global North, which the HRI lab recognizes as both &#8220;a global issue, and a human rights issue.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undergraduate Nik Altenberg said she felt a bit discouraged at a certain point in conducting this research, because of its gravity: &#8220;It&#8217;s very intense work, and emotionally traumatic.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, with the recent news development, Altenberg is cautiously optimistic of what&#8217;s to come, and believes the HRI Lab team should &#8220;all be proud of our team on this win.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward, the group isn&#8217;t sure of what&#8217;s to come with Title 42, but all agree that this work is more than just learning about a faraway crisis via textbooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to read about a crisis in a traditional college course &#8212;&#160;it&#8217;s another thing to actually collect information about the severity of a crisis,&#8221; Falc&#243;n said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an incredible way &#8212;&#160;a teaching moment &#8212;&#160;to show that the work they&#8217;re doing has real life impact. They have a small part in contributing to a significant outcome for migrants.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e8539faa8072704637c2d040137c2aae"><name>cerf-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Central Coast K-16 Education Collaborative secures planning grant for six-county region</title><summary>Spurred by California’s Regional K-16 Education Collaborative Grant Program, educational leaders from Santa Cruz to Ventura formed the Central Coast K-16 Education Collaborative to address the urgent, systemic educational inequities and economic needs in the region. </summary><start-date>1670313600000</start-date><path>/2022/12/cerf-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/cerf-grant</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1670345105300</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1670345105300</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Abby Butler</name><title></title><phone/><email>ajbutler@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/12/20081211-083227.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/12/20081211-083227.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>20081211-083227.jpg</name><display-name>20081211-083227.jpg</display-name><file-size>238702</file-size><width>500</width><height>328</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/12/campus-scenic.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2022/12/campus-scenic.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>campus-scenic.jpeg</name><display-name>campus-scenic.jpeg</display-name><file-size>6264</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six-county Central Coast K-16 Education Collaborative has been awarded a $250,000 planning grant through California&#8217;s Community Economic Resilience Fund (CERF)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to streamline equitable pathways from high school to postsecondary education and into the workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spurred by California&#8217;s Regional K-16 Education Collaborative Grant Program, educational leaders from Santa Cruz to Ventura formed the</span><a href="https://www.centralcoastk16collab.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Coast K-16 Education Collaborative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address the urgent, systemic educational inequities and economic needs in the region.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This planning grant is a key step toward addressing systemic educational inequity in the region,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to continue collaborating with our educational and workforce partners to seek real change for our communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is dedicated to working collaboratively with a wide range of regional stakeholders from a diverse set of interests to create a more inclusive, equitable, and competitive regional economy. The campus se</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rves all six counties of the Central Coast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanning over 300 miles, the Central Coast region is home to more than 2.5 million people in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz, San Benito, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The living costs within the region have increased sharply underscoring the urgent need to expand and diversify employment opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-year planning grant will enable the Central Coast K-16 Education Collaborative to develop a collective impact initiative to address equity gaps along the education-to-employment pathways for historically marginalized students and communities. There will be a special focus on equity, sustainability, job quality, economic competitiveness and resilience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next fall, the collaborative will submit an implementation grant application to the Regional K-16 Education Collaboratives Grant Program, a state-wide $250 million investment providing new pathways to career opportunities </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that addresses long-standing equity gaps for students in their local communities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program provides funding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to enhance or create collaborative efforts between the University of California system, the California State University system, Community Colleges, K-12 school districts, and workforce partners. This effort is a key component of a statewide strategy for cultivating regional economies and ensuring that education, vocational, and workforce programs work together to strengthen equitable education-to-workforce pathways.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the summer of 2022, over 50 K-16 partners from 25 institutions from across the Central Coast CERF region convened to establish the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> foundation of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Coast K-16 Education Collaborative a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd co-create a successful Phase 2 Planning Grant application that centered around equity and opportunity for students in the region who have faced long-standing systemic and structural barriers to their educational success and persistence as well as representation in high-skill, high-wage, high-demand regional employment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz and UC Santa Barbara pledged early support along with select K-12 school districts, County Offices of Education (COE), CSUs, and community colleges. Partners include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Pajaro Valley Unified School District, Ventura County Community College District, CSU Monterey Bay, UC Santa Barbara, and many other K-16 educational institutions, community organizations, and workforce partners throughout the Central Coast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Ventura County Community College District is honored to partner in this K-16 collaboration planning grant which will strengthen our education to workforce pipeline while ensuring the creation of sustainable strategies to address the multi-faceted inequalities in education and employment from high school to college and into the workforce,&#8221; said Dr. Cynthia Herrera, Vice Chancellor of Institutional Effectiveness, Enrollment and Advancement for Ventura County Community College. &#8220;The identification of interconnected priorities, through cross-sector collaboration, will result in a strategic regional framework, to enhance the students&#8217; journeys toward economic mobility while building the regional economy and meeting the region&#8217;s workforce needs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the planning year, the collaborative will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">establish and adopt an equity-centered vision and problem statement,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> select occupational pathways and Recovery with Equity strategies to build equitable education-to-workforce pathways within selected sectors, establish measurable goals, and define a continuous improvement framework </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to measure progress toward goals while informing improvement and fostering learning across the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of these efforts, the UC Santa Cruz </span><a href="https://epc.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educational Partnership Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EPC) will be serving as the lead organization, managing the grant funds and meeting reporting requirements. The EPC increases access to higher education for underrepresented students across the Monterey Bay, Pajaro Valley, and Silicon Valley and helps educationally-disadvantaged students in our region reach and succeed in college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Assistant Vice Chancellor of Educational Partnerships and Chief Campus Outreach Officer Maria Rocha-Ruiz, Principal Investigator, played a leadership role in helping build the region-wide coalition and establishing structures and processes to engage more than 50 K-16 partners.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Central Coast K-16 Education Collaborative will have an opportunity to drive transformational equity centered collective impact work across the region </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to address </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">long-standing social and economic inequities in higher education and workforce participation and I am honored for the EPC to be an integral part of this collective effort,&#8221; said Rocha-Ruiz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The K-16 Collaborative offers the region the chance to create a new, sustainable engagement process with K-12 schools, districts, and county offices of education and higher education institutions. K-12 families, educators and administrators are key partners. The grant will also unite a broad coalition of K-16 education partners, community organizations, nonprofits and employers. The synergy of this work will be supported by WestEd&#8217;s Postsecondary Education &amp; Career Mobility team that brings expertise in facilitation, research, postsecondary access and success, and career pathways to provide critical infrastructure and expertise to the Central Coast K-16 Education Collaborative, facilitating the formation of a strong, unified and sustainable Collaborative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This planning grant will strengthen our partnerships, leverage funding, and reinforce the coordination of our efforts to improve equity of outcomes for historically marginalized students and communities such as ours, predominantly Latinx and living in poverty,&#8221; said Dr. Michelle Rodriguez, Superintendent of Schools for Pajaro Valley Unified School District. &#8220;Our district looks forward to the continued inclusive, collective impact and equity-centered work of the Collaborative's many partners."&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e85a2ee08072704637c2d0408295b558"><name>bike-path-closure</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Great Meadow Bike Path Closure December 21-22</title><start-date>1670313600000</start-date><path>/2022/12/bike-path-closure</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/bike-path-closure</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1670345535180</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1670345535180</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 21 and 22, the Great Meadow Bike Path is scheduled to be closed for maintenance.

<p>UCSC scientists worked with the <a href="https://www.fema.gov/">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA), <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/">U.S. Geological Survey</a> (USGS), <a href="https://www.usace.army.mil/">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> (USACE), and <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA) on the project, which was approved and <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7268962">published by the Task Force in December</a>.</p>
<p>Austen Stovall, the report's lead author, worked on the project as a graduate student in the <a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/">Coastal Science and Policy Program</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;We developed this guide to help local project champions to apply for funding from FEMA and USACE to reduce coastal flooding by restoring coral reefs,&#8221; Stovall said.</p>
<p>Research Professor Michael Beck, who holds the AXA Chair in Coastal Resilience and directs the Center for Coastal Climate Resilience at UC Santa Cruz, noted that billions of dollars in federal funding are available for hazard mitigation and disaster recovery projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the Biden administration, FEMA wants to fund nature-based projects. Unfortunately, communities have not had the tools to be successful in winning funds for habitat restoration for coastal protection; we are solving that problem with this report,&#8221; Beck said.</p>
<p>Coral reef restoration for risk reduction (CR4) projects are different from solely ecological coral restoration projects in that CR4 projects aim to meet two different management objectives&#8212;environmental conservation and hazard mitigation. They often will require more specific placement and planning, detailed hydrodynamic analyses, and larger project scales to meet both objectives.</p>
<p>FEMA provides billions of dollars in hazard mitigation assistance to communities each year to reduce or eliminate long-term disaster risks. For example, in July 2022, President Biden announced that $2.3 billion would be available in the current fiscal year for pre-disaster hazard mitigation projects through FEMA&#8217;s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program. According to Stovall, this large amount of funding available through federal hazard mitigation sources could significantly increase the scale at which coral restoration can be implemented, as long as projects also meet hazard mitigation objectives.</p>
<p>Because this is a relatively new approach, many stakeholders, including community leaders, natural resource managers, and government entities, may not know when and where it can be used for flood risk reduction nor how to apply for funding for CR4 projects from agencies that provide funds for hazard mitigation or disaster recovery.</p>
<p>Beck's <a href="https://www.coastalresiliencelab.org/">Coastal Resilience Lab</a> at UCSC is involved in a variety of projects related to coral reef restoration, including work with the USGS and the Nature Conservancy to advance CR4 efforts in the U.S. Virgin Islands, with funding from FEMA. His group is also part of a collaborative coral reef restoration project focused on protecting vulnerable coastal regions in Florida and the Caribbean and funded by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as part of its nationwide <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/reefense-grant.html">Reefense</a> research program.</p>
<p>Coral reefs are highly diverse and biologically complex ecosystems that provide a range of key ecosystem services for people. The total economic value of coral reefs in the United States&#8212;based on their contributions to tourism, fisheries, and coastal protection&#8212;is estimated at $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>Coral reefs offer coastal protection by reducing flooding and erosion through wave breaking and friction. On average, coral reefs dissipate 97% of wave energy before it reaches coastlines. According to Stovall, coral reefs protect from flooding more than 18,000 people, $825 million in coastal infrastructure, and $700 million in economic activity annually in the United States.</p>
<p>Beck's group has been at the forefront of making the case for the value of nature-based solutions in coastal protection and adaptation to climate change. He and his team have worked with federal agencies and the insurance industry on a variety of projects to demonstrate the value of coastal wetlands, coral reefs, and mangroves for coastal defense. Beck noted that the approaches outlined in the CR4 guidance document can also be used to support many other nature-based projects and proposals beyond reef restoration for federal hazard mitigation funding.</p>
<p>Coauthor Curt Storlazzi at the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center said the USGS is &#8220;proud of have played a role in identifying how to value the hazard risk reduction benefits coral reefs provide coastal communities, and how such information may be used to help guide reef restoration with federal mitigation recovery funds.&#8221;<br/><br/>The USGS&#8217;s mission is to provide reliable scientific information to manage ecosystems and minimize loss of life and property from natural disasters.</p>
<p>The United States Coral Reef Task Force (USCRTF) was established in 1998 by Presidential Executive Order to lead U.S. efforts to preserve and protect coral reef ecosystems. The USCRTF includes leaders of Federal agencies, U.S. States, territories, commonwealths, and Freely Associated States. The USCRTF helps build partnerships, strategies, and support for on-the-ground action to conserve coral reefs.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e89afa178072704637c2d0406ee768ba"><name>climate-research-townhall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Leading the Change: The UC Santa Cruz Strategic Plan town hall to focus on climate change, research excellence</title><summary>In support of Leading the Change: The UC Santa Cruz Strategic Plan, all UC Santa Cruz community members are invited to attend the town hall about climate change and research excellence on Dec. 13 from 12:30-2 p.m. </summary><start-date>1670313600000</start-date><path>/2022/12/climate-research-townhall</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/climate-research-townhall</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1670349781508</created-on><last-modified-by>esmith16</last-modified-by><last-modified>1670525078093</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In support of Leading the Change: The UC Santa Cruz Strategic Plan, all UC&#160;Santa Cruz community members are invited to attend a town hall hosted by the Climate Change, Sustainability and Resilience Committee, and&#160;Distinction in Research, Scholarly and Creative Activities Committee.&#160;</p>

Researchers in these and similarly data intensive fields depend on their computers to access and move data around while also storing backup copies elsewhere in case one device crashes. Subfields of computer science and engineering are devoted to making this possible through networking multiple devices together. But when something goes wrong on one of these networked devices, it can create problems too complex for those without a speciality in programming distributed systems.<br/><br/>One solution to this problem is distributed shared memory (DSM), where a computer is programmed to locate any required data on the computer or elsewhere by following a &#8220;pointer,&#8221; which can refer to data on a different computer.<br/><br/>Past efforts to create this &#8220;holy grail&#8221; solution &#8211; a robust and efficient DSM system &#8211; have failed, but UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Peter Alvaro believes that advancements in technology mean that the time is right to revisit this idea. With the support of a new NSF grant, Alvaro is embarking on a project, called Memory at Scale On Networks (MaSON), to achieve a bold vision for a new operating system and network, each designed to best serve the other, to support an overall model for programming big data systems as if all of the data fit in one computer's memory. This system would make executing programs for scientific researchers faster and more robust.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;There's all these ways in which the idea of what memory is is expanding,&#8221; Alvaro said. &#8220;There's this opportunity to say, &#8216;Is now the right time to achieve that holy grail?&#8217; The goal is allowing experts in a domain to focus on their data and use their tools, without having to manage the supporting technology when a research problem arises that far outstrips what their one computer could do.&#8221;<br/><br/>The new operating system, called Twizzler, is already well underway, spearheaded by Alvaro&#8217;s Ph.D. student Daniel Bittman. Alvaro&#8217;s group will further develop hardware and software needed to make this vision a reality.<br/><br/>Importantly, in the new system, the context for interpreting the data is paired with the data itself, rather than paired with the relatively short-lived computational process that manipulates it.&#160; Alvaro says this is vastly different from current programming models. This context would eliminate some of the current complications of distributed networks such as when and how much data to cache, or store as a backup, and when and how much data to prefetch, or preemptively gather in anticipation that it could be needed.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Up until now, we've lived in what you might call a compute-centric world, dominated by processes, and in that world data is very much a second-class citizen,&#8221; Alvaro said. "The MaSON project completely turns that idea on its head. In the data-centric world that we envision, information is the primary citizen, outlasting any computation that may interact with it. Processes (and for that matter, computers) are just temporary places where data may live and change. If successful, this project will change the way we think about programming giant-scale systems."<br/><br/>Initially, Alvaro and his students hope to create an &#8220;appliance&#8221; that will enable the connection of a few dozen computers to operate as one. Eventually he hopes to employ MaSON in a larger data center setting.&#160;<br/><br/>Alvaro will collaborate on this project with Robert Soul&#233;, an associate professor of Computer science and electrical engineering at Yale University who works on robust memory on programmable networks. Alvaro plans for this project to take his lab group, which has grown significantly in past years, in a new direction that focuses more on this longer-term project and researching operating systems more broadly. Alvaro has now raised more than $2.5 million in combined funding from the NSF, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and Intel in the past two years to support this research.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e8b6bf6f8072704637c2d04027051315"><name>scott-reading-hof</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz professor inducted into the Reading Hall of Fame</title><summary>Judith Scott, UC Santa Cruz professor emerita of education, was inducted into the Reading Hall of Fame on Dec. 1 at the Literary Research Association Conference.

Scott was recognized and honored for her longstanding career and numerous contributions to teach education and research.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the 32 years of her career, Scott developed innovative approaches to vocabulary learning and assessment, working closely with classroom teachers to help students become aware of the power of language and the integrated use of multicultural children&#8217;s literature and writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott, an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation, will be the first Indigenous scholar in&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Reading Hall of Fame. The Reading Hall of Fame is an independent organization&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">comprised of 147 living members from the international community of literacy scholars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current members vote on membership and only five new members are selected each year.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the current President of the Hall of Fame put it in his letter announcing Scott&#8217;s election,&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being elected to the Reading Hall of Fame is one of the greatest honors that might be&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bestowed upon an individual serving the literacy profession.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout her career, Scott taught many courses in the graduate program and was well-known for her undergraduate course on Multicultural Children&#8217;s Literature. She also recently published an imagined fable as a children&#8217;s picture book in conjunction with the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band. The book, When the Mission Bells Rang, was featured as a Story Walk through downtown Santa Cruz as a collaborative effort between Santa Cruz Mission State Historic Park and the Santa Cruz Library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Scott retired after 22 years of service in the Education Department at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she has remained active as the Principal Investigator of the Central California&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing Project and as part of the Critical Mission Project working to amplify Indigenous voices&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in K-12 classrooms, and as a member of the UC Santa Cruz Indigenous Faculty Networking group.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, she received the Notable Vocabulary Researcher Award from the American Educational&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research Association, and in 2006 she received recognition for her work with teachers from&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the International Reading/Literacy Association.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

style="font-weight: 400;">Two outstanding UC Santa Cruz affiliates, Aviv Elor and Nada Miljkovic, have been chosen as finalists for the </span><a href="https://www.santacruzworks.org/news/titans-of-tech-finalists"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sixth annual Santa Cruz Works Titans of Tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an event that honors industry professionals who have contributed substantially to the growth of the local tech and entrepreneurial community. The 2022 Titans of Tech will be recognized during <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/titans-of-tech-2022-tickets-443406921037">tomorrow's award ceremony&#160;at the Santa Cruz Kuumbwa Jazz Center</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elor, who received a B.S. degree in robotics engineering and a Ph.D. degree in computational media from UC Santa Cruz, is </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/ucsc-alums-revolutionizing-telehealth-with-vr-physical-therapy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of three co-founders of Immergo Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the world&#8217;s first virtual and interactive telehealth platform for physical therapy. Immergo uses artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) to incorporate telehealth capabilities and enhance the accessibility, experience, and accuracy of remote physical therapy care. With just a VR headset, the platform connects patients and therapists in the same virtual room, as if they were interacting live in person, allowing the therapist to track movements and range of motion and provide real-time feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immergo Labs, which is based in Santa Cruz, has secured several industry and academic partnerships and recently received a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Science Foundation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phase 1 Small Business Innovation grant to further develop and test their prototype. Immergo&#8217;s beta platform will launch next month to users on their waitlist. The team plans to launch their product to the public by the end of 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elor&#8217;s areas of expertise include human computer interaction, immersive media, wearable robotics, computing, user experience, and emerging technologies, with a focus on iSTAR, Immersive Systems Towards Assisting Reality, Recovery, and Rehabilitation. He has authored more than 20 publications and received eight fellowships and awards during his academic career at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miljkovic is a UCSC alumna, artist, educator, and entrepreneur. For more than seven years, she has taught several undergraduate-level entrepreneurship courses at UCSC&#8217;s Crown College. She also serves as the program manager for the UCSC </span><a href="https://www.cied.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development (CIED),</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an industry and academic hub that fosters the teaching, research, and development of inclusive innovation and entrepreneurship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Miljkovic co-founded <a href="https://www.getvirtual.org/">GetVirtual</a>, an internship program that pairs college students with local businesses to support their transition to operating online, amid COVID-19&#8217;s detrimental impacts to in-person business operations. The program allows students to gain real-world experience and service learning credit, while local businesses get the website development and software support they need to be able to offer their services online. In addition to GetVirtual being offered as an in-person class at Crown College, called Crown 95: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">GetVirtual Business Assistance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is now offered fully online through Coursera, expanding the community-engagement program to students throughout the UC system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another 2022 Titan of Tech, Leila Takayama, taught at UC Santa Cruz as an associate professor of computational media before returning to industry this year. Takayama </span><a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2019/10/we-robot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">specializes in human computer interaction and human robot interaction (HRI)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She is the vice president of design and HRI at Robust.AI, where AI, robotics, and human-centered design are combined to create collaborative, mobile robots for increased workforce productivity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also recognized as Titans of Tech are: Allison Steitz, head of growth and innovation at Paystand; Bates Marshall, CEO and co-founder of Ambient Photonics, Inc.; Chris Bley, co-founder and director of Monterey Bay DART and founder of AirSpace Integration; Cindi Busenhart, founder and CEO at MERGE4; Joshua Resnick, CEO/CTO at Parallel Flight Technologies; Stacy Nagel, staff program manager at Google; and Will Wiseman and Alba Forns, co-founders at Climatize.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ee2a972d80727046459f81bff8de1e8c"><name>colombian-birds</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Colombia, a global biodiversity hotspot, faces rising threats to bird species from expanding human footprint</title><summary>A new study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters used satellite mapping data to analyze how changes in human footprint on the landscape between 1970 and 2018 overlapped with distributions of 1,469 Colombian bird species.

The study is the first of its kind to expand focus from forested regions, like the Amazon and Choc&#243;, to all of Colombia&#8217;s terrestrial habitats. Researchers also projected future trends in human impact on bird habitats through 2030.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The all-Colombian research team was led by joint first-authors Natalia Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela, an Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz, and Andr&#233;s Felipe Su&#225;rez- Castro, a researcher who is affiliated with the Australian Rivers Institute at Griffith University. The other co-authors are affiliated with the Humboldt Institute and the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, both based in Bogota, Colombia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team&#8217;s findings reveal that forest-dwelling birds in previously pristine habitats are increasingly at risk, as deforestation accelerates. Meanwhile, some species in less-studied habitats, like savannas and dry shrublands, face similarly serious impacts. Across all habitat types, birds that live exclusively or almost exclusively within Colombia or are already nationally listed as threatened will continue to bear the brunt of future impacts from human activities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colombia is a global hotspot for biological diversity and has almost 2,000 species of birds&#8212;more than any other country in the world. But 140 of Colombia&#8217;s bird species are nationally listed as threatened, mostly due to habitat impacts. The research team sought to identify additional species and habitats that might need protection in the future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope that this study can serve as an early warning,&#8221; Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela said. &#8220;This is a way to use remote-sensing data to propose which species we may need to focus our efforts on, in terms of reevaluating their conservation status.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To arrive at their findings, researchers built upon prior work that both </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.15.098855"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tracked changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in human footprint across space and time and projected </span><a href="http://reporte.humboldt.org.co/biodiversidad/2019/cap2/203/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">future trends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These existing national datasets provided map layers for seven variables, including land-use type, rural population density, proximity to infrastructure, and measures of habitat fragmentation and degradation. The team compared this with the habitat distributions of 1,469 resident Colombian bird species that have tight connections to terrestrial habitats within the country.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From this analysis, the team identified 69 birds for which human footprint had increased in more than 50% of the species&#8217; distribution between 1970 and 2018, and 19 of those were not yet listed nationally in any threat category for conservation. The sooty ant-tanager and Venezuelan troupial are two examples. Both birds live either exclusively or almost exclusively within Colombia. Nine additional birds that were similarly impacted but not yet listed were forest specialists, while eight others had habitat distributions outside of forests.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela says these and other findings from the paper around non-forest birds indicate a need for increased research and conservation across a wider variety of habitats in Colombia. Forests have traditionally been more heavily studied within the country, both because they are more readily identifiable on satellite imagery and because of the iconic nature of ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest. The current study&#8217;s focus across habitat types therefore helps to alleviate a bias toward forest species that has emerged in much of the conservation literature.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the paper&#8217;s findings also clearly show that forest-dwelling birds won&#8217;t be spared from habitat impacts either. In fact, they&#8217;re likely to be disproportionately affected in the future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many forest birds have remained kind of untouched for many decades, but because of the most recent wave of deforestation in the Andes-Amazon transition that began in 2015, our projections show that these birds will be significantly impacted in the next decade,&#8221; Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela said. &#8220;This huge spike in deforestation has moved so fast that some field studies are not able to keep track of it, but through these spatial projections, we can predict what's going to happen and try to get ahead of it by protecting those forests that are at the frontier of deforestation in Colombia.&#8221;</span></p>

The telescope captured light emitted by these galaxies more than 13.4 billion years ago, which means the galaxies date back to less than 400 million years after the Big Bang, when the universe was only 2% of its current age.</p>
<p>Initial observations from JWST yielded several candidate galaxies at extreme distances, as had earlier observations with the Hubble Space Telescope. Now, four of these targets have been confirmed by obtaining long spectroscopic observations, which not only provide secure measurements of their distances, but also allow astronomers to characterize the physical properties of the galaxies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve discovered galaxies at fantastically early times in the distant universe," said Brant Robertson, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;With JWST, for the first time we can now find such distant galaxies and then confirm spectroscopically that they really are that far away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Astronomers measure the distance to a galaxy by determining its redshift. Due to the expansion of the universe, distant objects appear to be receding from us and their light is stretched to longer, redder wavelengths by the Doppler effect. Photometric techniques based on images captured through different filters can provide redshift estimates, but definitive measurements require spectroscopy, which separates the light from an object into its component wavelengths.</p>
<p>The new findings focus on four galaxies with redshifts higher than 10. Two galaxies initially observed by Hubble now have confirmed redshifts of 10.38 and 11.58. The two most distant galaxies, both detected in JWST images, have redshifts of 13.20 and 12.63, making them the most distant galaxies confirmed by spectroscopy to date. A redshift of 13.2 corresponds to about 13.5 billion years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are well beyond what we could have imagined finding before JWST,&#8221; Robertson said. &#8220;At redshift 13, the universe is only about 325 million years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robertson and Emma Curtis-Lake from the University of Hertfordshire (U.K.) will be presenting the new findings on December 12 at a Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) conference in Baltimore on &#8220;<a href="https://www.stsci.edu/contents/events/stsci/2022/december/first-science-results-from-jwst">First Science Results from JWST</a>.&#8221; They are the lead authors of two papers on the results that have not yet been through the peer-review process (see links below).</p>
<p>The observations result from a collaboration of scientists who led the development of two of the instruments onboard Webb, the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec). The investigation of the faintest and earliest galaxies was the leading motivation in the concepts for these instruments. In 2015, the instrument teams joined together to propose the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), an ambitious program that has been allocated just over one month of the telescope&#8217;s time and is designed to provide a view of the early universe unprecedented in both depth and detail. JADES is an international collaboration of more than eighty astronomers from ten countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;These results are the culmination of why the NIRCam and NIRSpec teams joined together to execute this observing program,&#8221; said Marcia Rieke, NIRCam principal investigator at the University of Arizona.</p>
<p>The JADES program began with NIRCam, using over 10 days of mission time to observe a small patch of sky in and around the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Astronomers have been studying this region for over 20 years with nearly all large telescopes. The JADES team observed the field in nine different infrared wavelength ranges, capturing exquisite images that reveal nearly 100,000 distant galaxies, each billions of light years away.</p>
<p>The team then used the NIRSpec spectrograph for a single three-day observation period to collect the light from 250 faint galaxies. This yielded precise redshift measurements and revealed the properties of the gas and stars in these galaxies.</p>
<p>&#8220;With these measurements, we can know the intrinsic brightness of the galaxies and figure out how many stars they have,&#8221; Robertson said. &#8220;Now we can start to really pick apart how galaxies are put together over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Co-lead author Sandro Tacchella from the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom added, &#8220;It is hard to understand galaxies without understanding the initial periods of their development. Much as with humans, so much of what happens later depends on the impact of these early generations of stars. So many questions about galaxies have been waiting for the transformative opportunity of Webb, and we're thrilled to be able to play a part in revealing this story."</p>
<p>According to Robertson, star formation in these early galaxies would have begun about 100 million years earlier than the age at which they were observed, pushing the formation of the earliest stars back to around 225 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing evidence of star formation about as early as we could expect based on our models of galaxy formation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Other teams have identified candidate galaxies at even higher redshifts based on photometric analyses of JWST images, but these have yet to be confirmed by spectroscopy. JADES will continue in 2023 with a detailed study of another field, this one centered on the iconic Hubble Deep Field, and then a return to the Ultra Deep Field for another round of deep imaging and spectroscopy. Many more candidates in the field await spectroscopic investigation, with hundreds of hours of additional time already approved.</p>

<p><span>I recognize that the past weeks have been challenging for those involved with and impacted by the ongoing systemwide labor strike called by the United Auto Workers. The UAW represents UC academic employee groups in four separate bargaining units: Postdoctoral Scholars, Academic Researchers, Academic Student Employees (teaching assistants/readers/tutors), and Graduate Student Researchers. I was grateful to see the Office of the President and the UAW reach tentative agreements last week with the Postdoctoral Scholars and Academic Researchers and hope the new five-year contracts will be ratified soon. In the meantime, I remain hopeful for a resolution with the remaining two bargaining units, as UC and the UAW remain engaged at the bargaining table.</span></p>
<p><span>With finals for the most part behind us, I wish everyone a restful and restorative winter break. It is well-deserved.</span></p>

The revised second phase provides significantly more student housing than what was initially envisioned. When the Kresge renewal project is completed, it will provide 600 more beds than what the college originally held. Our efforts to expand housing at Kresge were greatly helped by the $89 million grant California lawmakers awarded to our campus in the 2022-23 state budget. In addition to subsidizing the additional Kresge housing, this grant will enable the campus to offer lower-cost housing rates to 320 students from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is wonderful news. Increasing the amount of campus housing is a critical element in advancing student success.</span></p>

The process provides us with a valuable opportunity to develop a shared vision for the future of UC Santa Cruz, one that advances our campus goals of fostering undergraduate and graduate student success, amplifying our research impact, promoting an inclusive climate, and becoming more sustainable and resilient. Our five thematic committees have been working to identify opportunities for improvement and ways to measure progress toward our goals. The committees are now beginning to present the priorities emerging in their work and ask the campus community for input and feedback through a number of mechanisms including an upcoming campus survey. The Climate Change, Sustainability and Resilience and Distinction in Research, Scholarly and Creative Activities committees are together holding a town hall via Zoom 12:30-2 p.m. Dec. 13 to gather input. For more information, email </span><span><a href="mailto:deemarti@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>deemarti@ucsc.edu</span></a></span><span>. Other committees are expected to hold stakeholder engagements in the winter quarter.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you to all in our community who have been involved with Leading the Change to date.&#160; I encourage even wider engagement and input as we enter this feedback stage. Strategic planning succeeds when it reflects a wide range of perspectives. Your voice matters.</span></p>
<p><span>As the new year approaches, I am proud of all that we have accomplished together in 2022. I hope that the winter break brings you joy and relaxation, and I look forward to reconnecting in 2023!</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cindy Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f9706abe807270460ffb75449aa80a76"><name>mitchell-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Social Sciences dean wins prestigious research award, visiting fellowship in Germany</title><summary>Social Sciences dean Katharyne Mitchell will be busy packing her bags for the holidays, but not for the reason you may think.

She&#8217;s heading to G&#246;ttingen, Germany, as a visiting scholar for the next six months at the <a href="https://www.mmg.mpg.de/home">Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Economic Diversity.</a></p>
<p>Mitchell received an invitation for a senior visiting fellowship for January-June 2023 for her current work on sanctuary practices in Germany. Her research explores the role of faith-based actors and institutions in providing physical aid to asylum claimants, focusing mainly on the importance of the buildings and spaces connected with church asylum. The focus on space is significant because churches and their surrounding neighborhoods can serve as anchors and repositories of collective memories of resistance and justice through time, which can be reactivated in moments of crisis for immigrants and refugees.</p>
<p>In addition to the Max Planck senior fellowship, Mitchell is the recent recipient of an award from the <a href="https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/">Alexander von Humboldt Foundation</a> that will enable her to conduct further research beyond the six-month fellowship and in multiple sites across Germany. She will take a sabbatical from UC Santa Cruz for the 2023 winter and spring quarters and then return to Berlin and other German cities for one month each year through 2028.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to study abroad in G&#246;ttingen and other cities in Germany and to collaborate with international colleagues with the same research interests,&#8221; said Mitchell. &#8220;This period of fieldwork and academic collaboration is absolutely vital for me to continue with my own intellectual passions but also to stay connected with the research enterprise in the division and with the challenges and needs of our research-active social sciences faculty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mitchell was a faculty member in the geography department at the University of Washington before joining UC Santa Cruz as social sciences dean in 2017. Her previous research explored transnational migration, immigrant integration, multiculturalism, citizenship, and education. Mitchell was the recipient of a <a href="https://www.gf.org/">Guggenheim Fellowship in 2016, </a>which she used to study the nature of sanctuary and the role of faith-based movements in migration policy and human-rights discourse in Europe. Towards the end of her Guggenheim-funded fieldwork, Mitchell gave a guest lecture at the Max Planck Institute in G&#246;ttingen, which was one of the catalysts for the current invitation.&#160;</p>
<p>Mitchell also became a distinguished professor in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s <a href="https://sociology.ucsc.edu/">Sociology Department in 2022.</a> When she returns to UC Santa Cruz in fall 2023, Mitchell looks forward to working with faculty in the department and throughout the division on migration, sanctuary, asylum, and refugee studies.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a wealth of migrant studies expertise in the social sciences, and I&#8217;m excited to expand our capacity and bring greater recognition to the faculty who are doing work in this area,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is a critical area of research, with important implications for the people of our state, as well as in Europe and globally.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0848b3d8807270460b70afb26b8c4bea"><name>citris-workforce-innovation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC workforce innovation internship program returns summer 2023 for its second offering</title><summary>The eight-week program offers UC students a unique opportunity to gain hands-on career experience in emerging fields of innovation. </summary><start-date>1670875200000</start-date><display-name>UC workforce innovation internship program</display-name><path>/2022/12/citris-workforce-innovation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/citris-workforce-innovation</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1670881260480</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1670890187067</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value><value>Technology and Information Management</value><value>Applied Mathematics and Statistics</value><value>Electrical Engineering</value><value>Computational Media</value><value>Computer Science</value><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/758563049?h=1d6720aca9" title="vimeo-player" width="400"></iframe></embed><width>400</width><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/12/images/wip-citris.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/12/images/wip-citris.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wip-citris.jpg</name><display-name>wip-citris.jpg</display-name><file-size>11251</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Amrita Mohandas, a fourth-year computer science and engineering student at UC Merced</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute invite undergraduates from all majors at UC Santa Cruz, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and UC Merced to apply to the 2023 Workforce Innovation Program (WIP).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WIP is a paid summer internship that pairs selected students with established companies, startups, labs, and nonprofit organizations to carry out projects related to one of five identified emerging areas of information technology innovation: aviation, climate and energy, digital health, robotics, and semiconductors.&#160;Increasing diversity and inclusion of underrepresented communities in the technology industry is a key focus of the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potential projects for the five different internship areas include expanding the use of drones to improve air transport, improving energy efficiency through green technologies, employing telehealth technologies to make healthcare more accessible, augmenting human experience and capacity in autonomous robots, and advancing micro and nanoelectronic technologies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the variety of hands-on opportunities and workshops offered during the eight-week, experiential learning program, students gain invaluable real-world experience and leadership skills.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This opportunity gave me the chance to apply my coding skills and see how diverse the robotic field is,&#8221; said Amrita Mohandas, a fourth-year computer science and engineering student at UC Merced, who was part of the program&#8217;s first cohort. &#8220;Once I finished the internship, I was far more confident in my application of computer science.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CITRIS is holding a virtual info session on January 10 at 12 p.m. PST. All students interested in applying are encouraged to attend. The application deadline is January 30, 11:59 p.m. PST. </span><a href="https://citris-uc.org/labs-programs/citris-workforce-innovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more.</span></a></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-folder id="0c255b7b80727046405ab490eca3c85c"><name>year-in-review</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1670946139430</last-published-on><last-published-by>raknight</last-published-by><path>/2022/12/year-in-review</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/year-in-review</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1670946052983</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1670946052983</last-modified><system-folder id="0c255c7e80727046405ab490bec3d0ab"><name>_nuxt</name><is-published>true</is-published><path>/2022/12/year-in-review/_nuxt</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/year-in-review/_nuxt</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1670946053243</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1670946053243</last-modified><system-folder id="0c255cdd80727046405ab490acc30aa5"><name>content</name><is-published>true</is-published><path>/2022/12/year-in-review/_nuxt/content</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/year-in-review/_nuxt/content</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1670946053338</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1670946053338</last-modified></system-folder><system-folder id="0c255d4280727046405ab490556ec204"><name>static</name><is-published>true</is-published><path>/2022/12/year-in-review/_nuxt/static</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/year-in-review/_nuxt/static</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1670946053439</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1670946053439</last-modified><system-folder id="0c255d4880727046405ab490cbba7579"><name>1670944654</name><is-published>true</is-published><path>/2022/12/year-in-review/_nuxt/static/1670944654</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/year-in-review/_nuxt/static/1670944654</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1670946053445</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1670946053445</last-modified></system-folder></system-folder></system-folder></system-folder><system-page id="0c633c8a80727046405ab490f2545a20"><name>end-of-fall-quarter</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Chancellor Update: Returning to campus post-break;

<p><span>As we mark the end of fall quarter, I offer my congratulations to students graduating and to everyone moving a step closer to achieving your academic goals. I also extend my thanks to our dedicated faculty and staff for your essential contributions to our broad campus effort to advance student success and research excellence, and the vital work you do every day.</span></p>
<p><span>I recognize that the past weeks have been challenging for those involved with and impacted by the ongoing systemwide labor strike called by the United Auto Workers. The UAW represents UC academic employee groups in four separate bargaining units: Postdoctoral Scholars, Academic Researchers, Academic Student Employees (teaching assistants/readers/tutors), and Graduate Student Researchers. I was grateful to see the Office of the President and the UAW recently reach tentative agreements with the Postdoctoral Scholars and Academic Researchers and that both contracts have now been ratified. In the meantime, I remain hopeful for a resolution with the remaining two bargaining units.</span></p>
<p><span>With finals behind us, I wish everyone a restful and restorative winter break. It is well-deserved.</span></p>
<h3><span>The highlights</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span>Take precautions when returning after winter break</span></li>
<li><span>Regents approve additional housing at Kresge</span></li>
<li><span>Campus receives Agriculture Experiment Station designation</span></li>
<li><span>Community input on strategic planning coming winter quarter</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Take precautions when returning after winter break</span></h3>
<p><span>Campus officials closely follow public-health trends and data. We know our campus experiences spikes in cases of communicable diseases after students and employees return after time away with family and friends, and there&#8217;s worry among public health officials nationwide of a &#8220;tridemic&#8221; come January, with a spike in cases of COVID-19, flu, and respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV. For that reason:</span></p>

The first phase, including three new residence halls with 400 student beds, community rooms, study lounges and a cafe, is well underway, with a projected opening next fall. The revised second phase provides significantly more student housing than what was initially envisioned. When the Kresge renewal project is completed, it will provide 600 more beds than what the college originally held. Our efforts to expand housing at Kresge were greatly helped by the $89 million grant California lawmakers awarded to our campus in the 2022&#8211;23 state budget. In addition to subsidizing the additional Kresge housing, this grant will enable the campus to offer lower-cost housing rates to 320 students from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is wonderful news. Increasing the amount of campus housing is a critical element in advancing student success.</span></p>

The process provides us with a valuable opportunity to develop a shared vision for the future of UC Santa Cruz, one that advances our campus goals of fostering undergraduate and graduate student success, amplifying our research impact, promoting an inclusive climate, and becoming more sustainable and resilient. Our five thematic committees have been working to identify opportunities for improvement and ways to measure progress toward our goals. The committees are now beginning to present the priorities emerging in their work and ask the campus community for input and feedback through a number of mechanisms including an upcoming campus survey. The Climate Change, Sustainability and Resilience and Distinction in Research, Scholarly and Creative Activities committees are together holding a town hall via Zoom 12:30&#8211;2 p.m. Dec. 13 to gather input. For more information, email <a href="mailto:deemarti@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>deemarti@ucsc.edu</span></a>.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Chris Benner &#8212; director of both the Everett Program for Technology and Social Change and the Santa Cruz Institute for Social Transformation &#8212; is one of the initial partners to receive funding from the recently launched Community Economic Mobilization Initiative, spearheaded by the </span><a href="https://www.sierrahealth.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sierra Health Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the support of a range of other philanthropies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.sierrahealth.org/2022/04/new-initiative-to-strengthen-community-resilience-and-build-healthier-communities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Economic Mobilization Initiative (CEMI)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a $17.7 million fund, aimed at supporting nonprofits throughout the state of California as they work toward receiving funds and directing federal and state economic development and climate change initiatives. Those strategic goals are to increase opportunities for local community organizations to decide how best public funds are allocated, and diversify who receives those funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This initial cohort of 17 grantee supported community partners includes the Action Council of Monterey County Inc., the Central Valley Community Foundation and the Inland Empire Labor Institute, to name a few. Many more grantees will be announced in coming weeks and months.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sierra Health Foundation president and CEO Chet P. Hewitt in April 2022 said: &#8220;These past few years have laid bare the impact of long-term disinvestment in poor communities&#8230;we must do all we can to position community institutions to grow power and create opportunity for the places and populations they serve.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the fund launched only in April of this year, it continues to grow and expand its reach. Benner, his long-time colleague Dr. Manuel Pastor and the national research and action institute PolicyLink will be developing a Technical Assistance Resource Center to support CEMI grantees.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Benner explained, the inclusive development issues that CEMI grantees are addressing stem from a &#8220;much broader set of issues,&#8221; which largely became more visible at the start and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a level of vulnerability and precarity that so many Californians face on a normal basis that, when the pandemic came along, just made [those issues] that much harder, and also more obvious to more people&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many organizations over the last two years searching for funding to address inequities, economic precarity and health vulnerabilities, it led to the question of: how to best leverage new public funding? That&#8217;s what inspired the CEMI funding, Benner says, in an effort to increase the influence of community organizations in the context of funding opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are major, multi-billion dollar pots of state and federal funding that are designed around promoting economic resilience and addressing climate change,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is almost a once-in-a-generation opportunity to influence these kinds of public pots of money.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, the CEMI initiative has worked with a variety of different funders, including&#160; the James Irvine Foundation, the California Endowment and others.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benner said that, in addition, Hewitt wanted to create &#8220;a source of technical assistance,&#8221; in which organizations could have readily available research and training assistance. That goal led Benner and Pastor to come aboard in working further on the initiative&#8217;s efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of their 20-year partnership, Benner and Pastor have collaborated on five different books in which they&#8217;ve addressed the important connection&#160; between equity and economic prosperity. In their most recent book &#8220;</span><a href="https://solidarityeconomics.org/se-book/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidarity Economics: Why Mutuality and Movements Matter&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2021), the pair were prompted by the pandemic&#8217;s early effects to pull together a comprehensive framework to show that equity is good for the economy. The three main points of their research found:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should always be talking about &#8220;our&#8221; economy rather than &#8220;the&#8221; economy, to remind us that economic activity is organized by people, not created by nature, and thus reflects values, power, and decisions we make.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our economy is rooted in collaboration and connection as much as it is competition, and when we invest in our mutuality, our economy does better.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since some people benefit from our current economic structures, to build an economy more rooted in mutuality, we also need to invest in social movements, to help shift power relationships while expanding and diversifying collaborations..</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That final point harkens back to the work CEMI aims to achieve, Benner said: shifting the power and economic decision-making in the current system, and recognizing ourselves in the broader sense of connection and mutuality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benner and Pastor&#8217;s past work has demonstrated across the country the importance of expanding and diversifying collaborations &#8212; across city and suburb, racial difference, political affiliation, and linking business, private, public and nonprofit sectors &#8212; which allows for better decision-making in regard to resources, leading to better social </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">economic outcomes. One component that facilitates these diverse networks is data on local economic and social conditions,&#160; said Benner, which helps facilitate dialogue and can bring diverse constituencies together around shared goals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benner&#8217;s work in the broader Monterey Bay area helps highlight the importance of breaking through silos, and building cross-sector collaborations. &#8220;One thing that&#8217;s important to think about, for example,&#160; is the connection between jobs, housing and transportation systems,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What characterizes our region is we have job centers in the city of Santa Cruz and the city of Monterey, in which the vast majority of people working in the city don&#8217;t live in the city.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That leads to discrepancies in terms of workers in the city contributing to our economy, which builds the public tax revenue, particular in the form of the transient occupancy tax and sales tax, but since they don&#8217;t live in the city, they see fewer benefits from public services and aren&#8217;t eligible to vote for city leaders. That further elicits a vast discrepancy between the revenue per capita of cities like Santa Cruz, Monterey and Carmel versus Watsonville and Salinas, and further drives resource inequality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It undermines the economic prosperity and environmental resilience for the whole region,&#8221; Benner said. &#8220;Because we&#8217;re underinvesting, all those things that shape economic prosperity don&#8217;t get dealt with.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s what makes CEMI that much more imperative, explained Benner. Of course, it&#8217;s not the only answer to the unequal economy, he said, but it helps to lift up priorities. Looking toward 2023, that means Benner and Pastor working with the other CEMI partners to create webinars, in-person training programs and the like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need to be thinking about more structural transformative solutions,&#8221; he said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0d12ed4480727046405ab49079bd086f"><name>ombuds</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>De Acker selected to serve as campus ombuds</title><summary>De Acker will serve as the UC Santa Cruz ombuds, providing impartial, informal, independent and confidential resolution services to faculty, staff, and students.&#13;

<p>Having founded the Office of Ombuds at UC Merced in 2012, Acker has helped students, faculty, and staff work through difficult situations they&#8217;re navigating in the campus environment.</p>
<p>"I really believe in the magic of ombuds," Acker said. "When people are able to express themselves, sometimes the conversation will change."</p>
<p>Chancellor Cynthia Larive announced today that Acker will support the UC Santa Cruz community as ombuds, starting Jan. 4. Associate Campus Provost Adrian Brasoveanu chaired the search.</p>
<p>"I am thrilled we were able to recruit someone of De&#8217;s caliber for our newly reconstituted ombuds position,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;She will be a great help as we continue our work to create and support inclusive environments for all students, staff and faculty, creating a new independent avenue to conflict resolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>The office, which will be on the fourth floor of the McHenry Library, will serve faculty, staff, and students who are seeking guidance with the resolution of academic or administrative issues and disputes. Acker will work with visitors to the office to facilitate communication and assist the parties in reaching mutually acceptable agreements to find fair and equitable resolutions to concerns.</p>
<p>The Office of Ombuds will function independently in managing cases and issues, though it will report to the Chancellor's Office for administrative and budgetary support. Without disclosing confidential communications, Acker will identify general trends, provide feedback throughout the organization, and advocate systems change when appropriate.</p>
<p>Acker comes to UC Santa Cruz with more than three decades of UC experience. She served as director of the UC Santa Barbara Women's Center for 12 years before joining UC Merced to serve as the assistant dean of the School of Natural Sciences.</p>
<p>After founding the campus's first ombuds office, she went on to establish the UC Merced Office of Campus Climate, which coordinated campus diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p>
<p>For the past two years, she managed special projects for the campus, including leading its response to COVID-19 and helping to lead the creation of a 65-foot labyrinth on campus. Labyrinths are a tool for stress reduction, mental health, and community building, commonly used for meditation, mindfulness and/or spiritual practice, and connecting to oneself and the environment.</p>
<p>Acker also served as a staff advisor to the UC Board of Regents from 2014-2016.</p>
<p>With all her experience in the University of California, Acker said she knows about all the resources available to faculty, staff, and students, and wants to make sure they receive the support they need.</p>
<p>"Students, Staff and faculty spend so much time on campus that I want to help people get rid of any barriers to having a happy, successful, and productive living-learning-teaching and researching career," Acker said.</p>
<p>In addition to the opportunity to re-establish the Office of Ombuds, Acker said she was drawn to UC Santa Cruz because of its commitment to advancing social justice and its leadership as a Hispanic-Serving Research University.</p>
<p>The UCSC Office of Ombuds closed in 2012 because of budget cuts, though some aspects of the role have have been filled by the Office of Campus Conflict Resolution Services, led by Director Nancy Heischman.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, Heischman has provided professional consultation, mediation and training to members of the UCSC community. The office focused on prevention, effective management, and informal resolution of conflict at all levels. Heischman will serve as a special advisor to ensure a smooth transition and is set to retire at the end of the academic year.</p>
<p>A 2019 review of existing compliance units revealed an opportunity to streamline resolution services on campus. In spring 2022, an external review team communicated with numerous campus stakeholders, and ultimately issued a report that recommended the hiring of a campus ombuds.</p>
<p>The services offered by the ombuds will supplement the other offices that are intended to advance and strengthen equity and access at UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0d3e9f7480727046405ab490f523ef29"><name>decarbonization-taskforce-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Decarbonization &amp; Electrification Planning and Town Hall</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is embarking on the next phase toward the full decarbonization and electrification of the campus.

To reach this goal, Chancellor Cynthia Larive has charged the UCSC Decarbonization &amp; Electrification (D&amp;E) Task Force with developing a long-term plan to end the use of fossil fuels by the university. The ultimate goal is to reduce carbon emissions, ideally to zero, by 2030, using current or emerging technologies and leveraging strategies and projects that have already been identified and are underway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our campus efforts build on a University of California systemwide </span><a href="https://ucop.edu/carbon-neutrality-initiative/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbon Neutrality Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160; announced by the Office of the President in 2013, committing UC to emit net zero greenhouse gases from its buildings and vehicle fleet by 2025, but go beyond carbon </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">neutrality</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by setting a plan for going carbon </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">free</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Decarbonization &amp; Electrification Task Force</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chancellor Larive has been engaged with the&#160; </span><a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/ucsc-climate-coalition/home"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Climate Coalition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, made up predominantly of students, to form a plan to achieve fossil-free operations on campus. In summer 2022, the chancellor created the </span><a href="https://sustainability.ucsc.edu/initiatives/decarb-electrific.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">D&amp;E Task Force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, composed of administrators, faculty, staff, and members of the UCSC Climate Coalition. The task force is also engaging consultants to help plan the university&#8217;s sustainable future.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why ending fossil fuel use is vital</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global climate disruption is impacting the planet in ways never before experienced in recorded human history. Everytime we use fossil fuel energy we&#8217;re contributing to the problem. Scientists say we only have a few years left to change course and avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. Luckily, California and the UC system are great leaders in this fight. Our regional electrical grid is around 93% carbon free and because of the </span><a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-ranks-first-among-colleges-and-universities-green-power-usage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC&#8217;s Clean Power Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all of UCSC&#8217;s purchased electricity is counted as carbon free. However, UCSC still generates considerable emissions from the combustion of natural gas in our </span><a href="https://physicalplant.ucsc.edu/energy-work-management/energy-management/campus-energy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cogeneration plant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This effort will engage consultants in identifying clean, electrical alternatives to our natural gas use.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Get involved</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We invite all UCSC community members, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">including students, staff, faculty, alumni, Santa Cruz residents and organization leaders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to join us on January 26, 2023, at the inaugural Decarbonization &amp; Electrification Town Hall. The D&amp;E Task Force and the Climate Coalition will update the campus on the task force&#8217;s work and lead a discussion on how to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan the next steps for the decarbonization of our campus.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your partnership, comments and suggestions are essential to creating an effective plan.&#160;</span></p>

The details of the program and eligibility criteria remain the same as our first year implementation. The effective date for biweekly paid employees is December 25, 2022 and the effective date for monthly paid employees is January 1, 2023. The following outlines the details of the program.</p>
<p><strong>Program Overview and Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The non-represented staff salary equity program will augment other campus salary programs such as annual increases and other equity adjustments. The purpose of this program is to bring employee salaries closer to the market (50th percentile of salary range) over a three-year timeline.</p>
<p>In the first and second year, the program prioritizes employees who are furthest below the midpoint of their respective Career Tracks salary ranges. Equity amounts for eligible employees will vary depending on individual pay circumstances.</p>
<p>The two main factors for consideration are an employee&#8217;s salary range penetration in their respective Career Tracks salary range and years in their current classification. Salary range penetration is a point between 0% - 100% indicating specifically where an employee&#8217;s salary falls within their salary range. Due to differences across employees in these two factors, not all employees will receive the same percentage salary increase, and not every employee will receive an increase.</p>
<p>In our second year, every non-represented staff member below the 75th percentile in pay grades 15 - 25 is eligible for salary adjustment consideration. For the six highest salary grades (26 - 31), only those who are below the 25th percentile are eligible.</p>
<p>This program is not intended to explicitly address existing compression issues, and it does not compound such issues either. If managers have concerns about compression, they should contact their compensation analyst to discuss and address specific issues on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Salary increases will range from 0.18% to 4% of annual pay with the average around 1.3%. About 78% of the approximately 1720 non-represented staff will receive an equity adjustment in the second year of the program. Based on program parameters, 49% of the funds will be distributed to employees at or below the 25th percentile and 42% of the funds will be distributed to employees at or above the 25th percentile and below the 50th percentile. Approximately 95% of the $1.5 million will be distributed to employees in grades 15 through 25.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Non-represented career, partial-year career and contract employees</li>
<li aria-level="1">Employees who have a &#8220;Met Expectations&#8221; performance rating or above for 2021/22 (if an evaluation was not completed, &#8220;Met Expectations&#8221; is assumed)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Employees hired <strong>before</strong> November 1, 2022</li>
</ul>
<p>An important element of this equity initiative is that new hires are expected to be hired no lower than the 25th percentile of the salary grade range. This new practice will help us achieve our objectives of being more competitive. Any exceptions must be reviewed with compensation personnel prior to making offers.</p>
<p>Combined with the traditional merit or general increase and traditional equities, this special program is designed to accelerate our progress towards a market-based compensation environment. We will monitor the outcome and implications over time; appropriate modifications to the program will be considered in the third year.</p>
<p>Eligible employees will be informed of their increases during the week January 9, 2023.</p>

A new study of volcanism in this area sheds light on the ancient breakup of a long island arc, which swung apart like &#8220;double saloon doors.&#8221; Fiji and Vanuatu started out as close neighbors and ended up 800 miles apart on separate sections of what had once been a continuous arc.</p>
<p>Island arcs form where a plate of the oceanic crust sinks beneath an adjacent plate in a process known as subduction, giving rise to a belt of volcanoes parallel to the trench where the descending plate bends downward. The islands are the tallest peaks of vast underwater mountain ranges built up by volcanic activity in the subduction zone. One such range now goes from New Zealand up to Tonga, then bends westward to Fiji. Another extends from New Guinea down to Vanuatu.</p>
<p>&#8220;They all used to be connected to one another, and then they got split apart in the geologic past,&#8221; explained James Gill, professor emeritus of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz and first author of the new paper. &#8220;This paper attributes the breakup to the subduction of the Samoan Seamount Chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Samoa, like Hawaii, is part of a linear chain of volcanic seamounts formed as the oceanic crust moves over a &#8220;hotspot&#8221; in the Earth&#8217;s mantle, causing a series of volcanoes to grow over that spot. A long chain of seamounts extends to the west of the Samoan islands.</p>
<p>&#8220;When that chain of seamounts got pushed down into the Earth underneath the island arc, it caused indigestion in the subduction zone, which ultimately broke it apart,&#8221; Gill said.</p>
<p>In addition to the seamounts getting hung up in the subduction zone, other complex processes were at work across the island arc, including a reversal of the direction of subduction along part of the arc, the rotation of different segments, and the opening of rifts where seafloor spreading creates new oceanic crust. The Vanuatu Arc rotated clockwise while the fragment of crust bearing Fiji rotated counter-clockwise.</p>
<p>These events (dubbed &#8220;double-saloon-door tectonics&#8221; by geologist Keith Martin in 2013) began about 10 million years ago and proceeded slowly over millions of years leading up to the present configuration of the islands.</p>
<p>Gill and his coauthors investigated this history by analyzing samples of volcanic rock collected at sites throughout the area in the 1980s by Gill and Peter Whelan, who was then a UCSC graduate student and performed initial analyses of the samples. For the new study, Gill received funding from a Humboldt Research Award to work with researchers at the GEOMAR Helmholz Center for Ocean Research in Germany, who performed modern geochemical analyses to determine the isotopic and elemental composition of the samples.</p>
<p>&#8220;These analyses allow us to use isotopes as long-lived tracers to find out what melted to produce the magma that erupted from a particular volcano,&#8221; Gill explained. &#8220;In this case, we can see that the Samoan seamounts are the best match for the rocks that erupted in Fiji at the time this island arc broke apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gill has been studying the geology of the South Pacific islands for more than 50 years, collecting hundreds of volcanic rock samples from remote islands in Fiji, eastern Indonesia, and the Marianas, as well as other sites around the Pacific &#8220;rim of fire.&#8221; Most of those samples are now in curated collections at the Smithsonian Institution and the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was hired 50 years ago, UCSC was starting a Center for South Pacific Studies, which is one reason why the Arboretum has so many plants from New Zealand and Australia,&#8221; Gill said. &#8220;This paper is part of my career-long efforts to understand the geological evolution of Fiji, and it links the histories of Fiji, Vanuatu, and Samoa.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edward D. Reiskin will be joining UC Santa Cruz in early February as our next Vice Chancellor for Finance, Operations and Administration, and Chief Financial Officer. Ed currently serves as the city of Oakland&#8217;s top administrative officer, and I am excited that he will be joining our leadership team. He brings with him extensive management experience, with more than 20 years as a public sector administrator. His ability to successfully navigate complex environments and diverse stakeholder groups, and his competency in a host of areas over which he will have direct oversight on our campus, will greatly benefit our campus community. </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/12/vcfoa-announcement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will find a story on Ed on our campus newscenter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">De Acker has accepted our offer to become Campus Ombuds. She joins us from UC Merced, where she is Director of Programs Development. She previously served as the director of the Office of Campus Climate. Her first day will be Jan. 4. I am thrilled we were able to recruit someone of De&#8217;s caliber for our newly reconstituted ombuds position, which was eliminated on our campus in 2012 in response to budget reductions. She has deep experience in both conflict resolution and issues of equity and inclusion. She will be a great help as we continue our work to create and support inclusive environments for all students, staff and faculty. An ombuds is extremely valuable, able to facilitate two-way, informal communication that can resolve workplace issues that could otherwise escalate into more serious matters.</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/12/ombuds.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A story on De is posted online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thank all in our campus community who participated in these recruitments. I appreciate the feedback and perspectives you shared after listening to presentations by the finalists. In both searches, we had strong candidates to consider, offering unique skills and strengths. I believe we have found strong additions to our leadership team in both Ed and De.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I offer my deep thanks to Biju Kamaleswaran, who will continue to serve as the Finance, Operations and Administration Division&#8217;s interim leader until Ed&#8217;s arrival in February. Biju has filled that role since January 2022. When Ed arrives, Biju will return to his post as Associate Vice Chancellor, Financial Affairs and Campus Controller. The work of the division is so critical to our mission, and the FOA team has continued to strengthen its services and support since Biju took the reins nearly a year ago.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for helping to recruit these excellent leaders and please help me welcome them to campus over the coming months.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0dce6e9980727046405ab4908f40da21"><name>vcfoa-announcement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC selects Edward Reiskin as next Vice Chancellor for Finance, Operations and Administration</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has chosen Edward D.

Reiskin as its next Vice Chancellor for Finance, Operations and Administration and Chief Financial Officer. He will start in early February 2023.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reiskin has more than 20 years of professional experience as a public sector administrator. He currently serves as the city of Oakland&#8217;s top administrative officer. He is responsible for executing and enforcing all of the city&#8217;s laws and policies, administering city affairs, and overseeing an operating budget of $2.2 billion, roughly 4,500 employees, and the city&#8217;s capital program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reiskin is set to begin on campus in early February, capping a national recruitment that began in May with campus stakeholder-engagement meetings. Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer chaired the search advisory committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The scope and breadth of Ed&#8217;s experience, his ability to navigate complex environments and diverse stakeholder groups, and his competency in a host of areas over which he will have direct oversight on our campus make him a strong addition to our leadership team,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;I am grateful for the efforts of the search advisory committee and appreciative of all in our campus community who shared their insights during the recruitment. We leaned deeply on community feedback throughout this process."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vice Chancellor for Finance, Operations and Administration is a key position at UC Santa Cruz, as this leader is entrusted with a wide range of responsibilities. Colleges, Housing and Educational Services; Financial Affairs; Physical Planning, Development and Operations; Risk and Safety Services; Staff Human Resources; and Sustainability are all units within the division. The position was previously known as Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services. The name of the division and the position were changed this summer to better reflect the division&#8217;s key functions.&#160;</span></p>
<p>Reiskin has more than two decades of management experience. He began his current role in Oakland in 2020. Previous to that he served as the city&#8217;s Assistant City Administrator; Director of the Municipal Transportation Agency for the City and County of San Francisco; and Director of the San Francisco Department of Public Works. Prior to his arrival in the San Francisco Bay Area, he served as interim City Administrator for the District of Columbia, and for two years as the district&#8217;s Deputy Mayor for Public Safety &amp; Justice. His management responsibilities in these various roles have included finance, infrastructure, transit, housing, capital planning and public safety.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reiskin earned a master&#8217;s of public administration from Harvard University&#8217;s John F. Kennedy School of Government; a master&#8217;s of business administration from New York University&#8217;s Leonard N. Stern School of Business; and a bachelor&#8217;s of science in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said he has always valued working in local government because of the ability to make a tangible impact on the lives of others. &#8220;Focusing on programs, projects and policies that help the disenfranchised, the ability to make a difference in people&#8217;s lives who have been marginalized, that brings a lot of meaning to the work,&#8221; he said, noting the similarity of work in higher education, especially at a public university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reiskin said that while many of the responsibilities of the Finance, Operations and Administration Division are &#8220;back-office functions,&#8221; the work is directly relevant to the lives and experiences of students, staff and faculty. &#8220;Payroll, dining, housing, HR, procurement &#8212; these are all critically essential functions that matter to people.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC&#8217;s long history of social-equity and environmental-justice advocacy, the campus commitment to research excellence, and the beauty of the landscape itself were big draws for Reiskin, as were strategic planning that&#8217;s now taking place and the recently approved Long Range Development Plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having those elements in place makes it an exciting time to come to UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I look forward to supporting implementation of the LRDP and guiding the division in support of campus goals set in the new strategic plan.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until Reiskin arrives on campus, Biju Kamaleswaran will continue to serve as the division&#8217;s interim leader, a role he has held since January 2022. When Reiskin arrives, Kamaleswaran will return to his post as Associate Vice Chancellor, Financial Affairs and Campus Controller.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0df45b2d80727046405ab490ffc4817e"><name>latinx-drug-use-report</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC researcher explores drug use, harm reduction in San Francisco’s Latino/x community </title><summary>It’s no secret that the opioid epidemic has devastated our country, especially within communities of color.

<p>For these reasons, the <a href="https://sf.gov/departments/department-public-health">San Francisco Department of Public Health</a> funded a needs assessment published in November titled<a href="https://cdn.brandfolder.io/XUPFM47Z/at/w6xmjmm3b3bqshrcjr2skk7/Unido_xs-Contra-la-Sobredosis-United-Against-Overdose-Needs-Assessment.pdf"> Unido/xs Contra La Sobredosis (United Against Overdose).</a> The report is a joint effort between the <a href="https://www.sfaf.org/">San Francisco AIDS Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://harmreduction.org/">National Harm Reduction Coalition</a>. (Harm-reduction efforts seek to reduce the negative consequences of substance use without requiring people to cease using drugs.) Under the Biden administration, harm-reduction efforts have received unprecedented <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2022/08/31/actions-taken-by-the-biden-harris-administration-to-address-addiction-and-the-overdose-epidemic/">support</a> and funding. The lead author for the report is <a href="https://lals.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=cmart195">Carlos Martinez</a>, a recent addition to UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Global and Community Health faculty in the Latin American and Latino Studies Department.</p>
<p>&#8220;The report found that harm reduction isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all approach. It needs to be tailored to meet the needs of different communities, and we need to clearly communicate the necessity and effectiveness of harm reduction in the Latino/x community,&#8221; said Martinez. &#8220;Our goal is to get funding for capacity building for organizations already serving the Latino/x community and to provide trainings on harm reduction for those that have not focused on substance use.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>The needs assessment explores drug use and the gaps and barriers to harm reduction services for the Latino/x community in San Francisco, a historically underserved population. It includes 105 quantitative respondent surveys and qualitative interviews of self-identified Latino/x drug users.&#160;</p>
<p>Most participants (84.76%) identified as male, while 6.67% identified as female and 7.62% as transgender. Around 66.35% of respondents identified as heterosexual, while 15.38% identified as homosexual and another 15.38% as bisexual. Participants ranged in age from 23 to 74 years old, with a mean age of 46. More than a third of participants (37.38%) in the study reported living in single-room occupancy housing, and over a quarter (25.23%) were housing insecure.</p>
<h4>Drug and alcohol use</h4>
<p>Despite the rise in opioid use, the most consumed drug reported by participants was methamphetamine (27.90%). In comparison, 22.75% of participants reported regular alcohol use, 8.58% reported crack use, and 8.15% reported cocaine use.&#160;</p>
<p>Three participants reported regular use of heroin, two reported regular use of fentanyl, and three reported regular use of prescription opioids. Over a quarter of participants (25.93%) also reported using fentanyl at least once.</p>
<h4>Overdoses common</h4>
<p>A quarter of participants reported experiencing an overdose at least once, and many of them overdosed more than two times. More than half (53.33%) said they didn&#8217;t know what Narcan or Naloxone is (highly effective medications that can reverse opioid overdoses) or how to obtain them (22.92%).</p>
<p>More than a third of participants (40.19%) felt either somewhat or very unfamiliar with the signs of an overdose. In comparison, 36.27% reported feeling either somewhat or very incapable of providing effective support for someone experiencing an overdose.&#160;</p>
<h4>Barriers to services</h4>
<p>Perhaps, the most significant barrier is an awareness that these services exist. A large majority of participants (67.31%) did not know what harm reduction is.</p>
<p>Many of those who were aware felt uncomfortable accessing services for being seen by their peers (20%) or due to their immigration status (47.57% of respondents were undocumented). Approximately a third (32.69%) of respondents expressed feeling somewhat or very fearful of police, while 27.18% reported feeling somewhat or very fearful of being detained by immigration authorities.</p>
<p>Among service providers, 80% believe we do not have sufficient overdose prevention services for Latino communities in San Francisco. In comparison, 70% stated that they do not know of a treatment facility to assist Spanish and Mayan-speaking clients.&#160;</p>
<h4>Short and long-term actions</h4>
<p>Martinez and his colleagues hope this work will impact <a href="https://sf.gov/sites/default/files/2022-09/SFDPH%20Overdose%20Plan%202022.pdf">San Francisco&#8217;s Overdose Prevention Plan,</a> which aims to reduce fatal overdoses by 15% and reduce racial disparities among communities of color, including the Latino/x population, by 2025. Their report calls for an increase in hiring, retention, and training of Latino/x bilingual harm reduction workers, resources to support the sustainability of existing community-based harm reduction programs, tenant-led overdose prevention programming, supportive housing, and more.&#160;&#160;</p>
<h4>Early harm reduction work</h4>
<p>Martinez began exploring harm reduction work in Tijuana, Mexico, as part of his doctoral degree <a href="https://humsci.ucsf.edu/medical-anthropology">program</a> in medical anthropology at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley. He examined the social and political conditions affecting the health of two communities, deportees from the United States and asylum seekers predominantly from Central America. He found abundant drug use among the community of homeless deportees in Tijuana, mainly opioids and meth. Through his research, he collaborated closely with two organizations in Tijuana: the <a href="https://lacuscem.com/resource/elective-opportunities/">Wound Clinic</a> and the <a href="https://www.refugeehealthalliance.org/">Refugee Health Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was working with organizations in Tijuana that offer free medical services and found that many deportees felt like they had lost their connection to Mexico and were suffering from social marginalization and a lack of employment and housing, which in many cases, led to drug use,&#8221; said Martinez. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t know where to seek help and were often being forced into jail or coercive drug rehabilitation centers by local police officers for their drug use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, as a faculty member at UC Santa Cruz, Martinez looks forward to expanding his harm reduction research and developing the <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/work/research/migration-health/">Migration &amp; Health</a> focus area within the Global and Community Health program. In future research, Martinez is interested in examining how contemporary immigration and drug policies harm Latinos who use drugs and how harm reduction efforts can most effectively serve this community, particularly those undocumented and at risk of deportation.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1683d8c28072704628d76df34e576770"><name>sanchez-allen-investigator</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Biochemist Laura Sanchez receives Allen Distinguished Investigator award</title><summary>Sanchez is among 16 new Allen Distinguished Investigators awarded a total of $10 million in research funding to support cutting-edge projects in protein lifespan and nutrient sensing.</summary><start-date>1671091200000</start-date><display-name>Biochemist Laura Sanchez receives Allen Distinguished Investigator award</display-name><path>/2022/12/sanchez-allen-investigator</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/sanchez-allen-investigator</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1671120017573</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1671120291340</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/laura-sanchez-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/laura-sanchez-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>laura-sanchez-300.jpg</name><display-name>laura-sanchez-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>64142</file-size><width>300</width><height>349</height></image><image-alt>Laura Sanchez</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/laura-sanchez-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/laura-sanchez-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>laura-sanchez-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>laura-sanchez-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17055</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Laura Sanchez</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Laura Sanchez (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Sanchez is among 16 new Allen Distinguished Investigators awarded a total of $10 million in research funding to support cutting-edge projects in protein lifespan and nutrient sensing</article-subhead><article-text><p>Laura Sanchez, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, has received funding for her research on nutrient sensing from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation as recommended by the Paul G. Allen Frontiers Group, a division of the Allen Institute. Sanchez is among 16 new Allen Distinguished Investigators awarded a total of $10 million in research funding to support cutting-edge projects in protein lifespan and nutrient sensing.</p>
<p>Sanchez is working with Lydia Kisley at Case Western Reserve University on a project to study nutrients inside individual cells. Currently, scientists don&#8217;t have a good way to measure the distribution of nutrients in cells. Sanchez and Kisley are leading the development of a technique to address this problem by physically expanding cells&#8212;picture a cell stretched on silly putty&#8212;which allows them to capture details of nutrient location and amount in those cells.</p>
<p>Their new method is called Expansion Mass Spectrometry, and the scientists plan to use it to study nutrients in and around ovarian cancer cells to better understand metabolism in these cancer cells and how the cells&#8217; local environments influence nutrient location and amounts. Novel techniques like this could propel understanding of the basic biology of cells as well as how metabolism or nutrition processing goes wrong in disease.</p>
<p>Sanchez&#8217;s lab at UCSC focuses on the use of analytical mass spectrometry techniques, such as tandem mass spectrometry and imaging mass spectrometry, to elucidate the chemistry by which cells and microbes communicate and coordinate biological functions in complex backgrounds. This year, in addition to the Allen Distinguished Investigator award, Sanchez has received the 2022 ACS Infectious Diseases Young Investigator Award and the American Society of Pharmacognosy&#8217;s 2022 Matt Suffness Young Investigator Award.</p>
<p>Sanchez earned her B.A. in chemistry at Whitman College and her Ph.D. in chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. She was an associate professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Illinois Chicago before joining the UCSC faculty in 2021.</p>
<p>The Allen Distinguished Investigator program was launched in 2010 by the late philanthropist Paul G. Allen to back creative, early-stage research projects in biology and medical research that would not otherwise be supported by traditional research funding programs. Including the new awards, a total of 130 Allen Distinguished Investigators have been appointed during the past 12 years. Each award spans three years of research funding.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="16b635f98072704628d76df37d5aa954"><name>browser-biodata-list</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC Genome Browser selected to first-ever Global Core Biodata Resource List</title><summary>The UCSC Genome Browser is now part of the first list of Global Core Biodata Resources—a collection of 37 resources whose long-term funding and sustainability is critical to life science and biomedical research worldwide.</summary><start-date>1671116400000</start-date><path>/2022/12/browser-biodata-list</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/browser-biodata-list</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1671123318243</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1671123318243</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/12/images/gcbr-logo-rgb_450.png</path><link>site://news/2022/12/images/gcbr-logo-rgb_450.png</link><site>news</site><name>gcbr-logo-rgb_450.png</name><display-name>gcbr-logo-rgb_450.png</display-name><file-size>54747</file-size><width>450</width><height>191</height></image><image-alt>Global Core Biodata Resources logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/12/images/gcbr-logo-rgb_80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/12/images/gcbr-logo-rgb_80.png</link><site>news</site><name>gcbr-logo-rgb_80.png</name><display-name>gcbr-logo-rgb_80.png</display-name><file-size>7610</file-size><width>80</width><height>34</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Global Core Biodata Resources logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Genome Browser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the one of the most widely used resources for genomics worldwide, with about 20,000 researchers visiting the site per day to access its repository of information on the genomes of thousands of species from humans to viruses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the Browser is part of the first list of </span><a href="https://globalbiodata.org/scientific-activities/global-core-biodata-resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Core Biodata Resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;a collection of 37 resources whose long-term funding and sustainability is critical to life science and biomedical research worldwide. By bringing together major public and charitable funders, the lists&#8217; organizers aim to ensure the continuing success of these crucial resources that currently rely on short-term, unstable funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2000 to host the first draft of the human genome, the UCSC Genome Browser hosts 30 terabytes of genome annotations, with the large majority of the annotations related to the human genome. The Browser team works with more than a hundred databases that provide chromosomal data, and usually the Browser web interface (genome.ucsc.edu) is the only place&#160; where annotations from two very different databases can be shown at the same time and compared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We're hoping that Global Biodata resources will increase the stability of the databases and websites that have become essential for genome analyses today," said Max Haeussler, co-principal investigator of the UCSC Genome Browser.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Global Core Biodata Resources list is an initiative of the Global Biodata Coalition, which is a new association of the top academic research funders worldwide, including the United State&#8217;s National Institute of Health, and National Science Foundation, nonprofits such as the Chan-Zuckerburg Initiative, and </span><a href="https://globalbiodata.org/governance/who-we-are/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other funding institutions from the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Australia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the resources chosen to be on the Global Core Biodata Resources list were selected because they have been determined to be critically important to continued global research efforts in the life sciences and biomedicine due to their status as crucial to the components within the global life science data infrastructure.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the resources on the list are available openly and can be accessed and used without restriction by researchers the world over. Openness has been a crucial characteristic of the UCSC Genome Browser since it was launched in 2000 as a response to fears that private entities would attempt to patent parts of the human genome.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This first set of Global Core Biodata Resources were selected through a rigorous two-stage process open to biodata resources globally. More than 60 resources submitted expressions of interest, and at each stage of the selection process, the candidate biodata resources were assessed by a panel of more than 50 independent expert reviewers against a series of criteria that included their scientific focus, the size and reach of their user communities, their quality of service, their governance, and their impact on global research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list&#8217;s partner funders will now actively work with the community of Global Core Biodata Resources to explore funding models that ensure these biodata resources are able to develop and sustain the critical services they provide to the global research community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Selecting this first set of Global Core Biodata Resources is an important step for better&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">understanding the broader ecosystem of data resources that are vital to life science</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and biomedical research,&#8221; said Eric Green, director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute and Global Biodata Consortium board member.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1c7e756d8072704640d2b5f8cd58bd88"><name>gomez-ml-precisionmed</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New study presents vision of machine learning leveraged for precision medicine</title><summary>In a new perspective published in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science, Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics Marcella Gomez details a vision for how the field can move beyond static data to create systems that measure and monitor the real-time responses of the body to a variety of factors and use a machine learning algorithm to produce, and even in some instances carry out, a treatment plan.</summary><start-date>1671210000000</start-date><path>/2022/12/gomez-ml-precisionmed</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/gomez-ml-precisionmed</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1671220327768</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1671220327768</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Applied Mathematics and Statistics</value><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/12/images/marcella_300.png</path><link>site://news/2022/12/images/marcella_300.png</link><site>news</site><name>marcella_300.png</name><display-name>marcella_300.png</display-name><file-size>154458</file-size><width>300</width><height>302</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Marcella Gomez</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/12/images/marcella_80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/12/images/marcella_80.png</link><site>news</site><name>marcella_80.png</name><display-name>marcella_80.png</display-name><file-size>16653</file-size><width>79</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Marcella Gomez</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics Marcella Gomez.&#160;</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>As a patient recovers from a wound, a doctor may watch over them, monitoring the healing process and prescribing treatments based on the body's responses. But a wide variety of factors including diet, age, or diseases such as diabetes all play a role in healing, and monitoring these variables on a daily basis can be difficult for doctors, especially for chronic conditions.&#160;<br/><br/>In the face of these challenges, researchers at UC Santa Cruz are envisioning systems that could constantly monitor these complex factors as well as the ongoing responses of the body, and by way of a machine learning algorithm, suggest or even administer treatment.<br/><br/>This continuous response to metrics or tests is a form of feedback control &#8211; an engineering concept for comparing a variable to a target value. Control theory is commonly used in the engineering of dynamic systems, but much less so by doctors. Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics Marcella Gomez&#8217;s research focuses on bridging that gap, with potential to bring high quality healthcare to more people through machine learning algorithms that automate precision medicine.<br/><br/>In a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266638642200460X#:&#126;:text=Namely%2C%20machine%20learning%20can%20be,to%20an%20individual%20patient's%20response.">new perspective</a> published in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science, Gomez details a vision for how the field can move beyond static data to create systems that measure and monitor the real-time responses of the body to a variety of factors and use a machine learning algorithm to produce, and even in some instances carry out, a treatment plan. The article serves as a call to the relatively small and new community of researchers working on these problems to start to think about a broader scope of open challenges and questions in the field.<br/><br/>&#8220;You can get high quality care to a larger population, without having to extensively train doctors for decades,&#8221; Gomez said.<br/><br/>Right now, Gomez says, methods for using machine learning in precision medicine focus on leveraging static indicators: unchanging factors that are used to predict the outcomes of a disease or chronic wounds, such as the presence of a genomic mutation. This involves gathering historical data from past cases and using that to inform predictions of how a disease or wound might progress.<br/><br/>But the new study emphasizes the need to develop more data-driven methods to advance the modeling and control aspects of using machine learning to enhance precision medicine. This would mean more predictive models that are based purely on data, rather than trying to capture and model the full range of biological processes involved, which would be an extremely complex task.&#160;<br/><br/>She also wants to see the field move toward systems that are more adaptive and can change with the shifting needs of the body.&#160;<br/><br/>In traditional control theory, the engineer knows information about the dynamic characteristics of a system, and uses that to choose which controls are best suited for those particular characteristics. But, the complexity of the human body makes it difficult to pinpoint just one suitable controller. This requires a new way of envisioning control.<br/><br/>&#8220;You can think about using a machine learning approach where the controller adapts itself &#8211; it can identify if it&#8217;s not doing such a great job at achieving its goal and can thereby even adjust its own strategy in the way that it suggests treatments based on the input until it sees that it's getting closer to achieving its goal,&#8221; Gomez said. &#8220;It will always look to optimize its own performance.&#8221;<br/><br/>Gomez says these improved algorithms could be used to expand applications of feedback control beyond existing work such as the artificial pancreas that continuously measures glucose levels and delivers insulin when needed. The algorithms can also enhance a human-in-the-loop system where a doctor reads the response of a monitoring system and administers treatment based on algorithmic suggestions.<br/><br/>She is collaborating on this research with Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Marco Rolandi, a coauthor on the perspective who designs sensors and actuators that they hope to use to actualize these concepts of feedback control, and Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Mircea Teodorescu, an expert in bioengineering and robotics. The two researchers are currently applying these concepts to <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/wound-healing.html">their project</a> aimed at creating a novel smart bandage that speeds up the healing of serious wounds.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>On December 6, Gomez co-led a National Institutes of Health (NIH) breakout session, titled &#8220;Scaling up Biocontrol Methods to Complex Biological Systems,&#8221; on this topic as part of the <a href="https://www.syntheticbiology.nibib.nih.gov/meeting">NIH&#8217;s Synthetic Biology Consortium Meeting</a>.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1cc3aa978072704640d2b5f86571c828"><name>winter-return-health-guidance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Community health guidance for returning from winter break</title><summary>This message from Student Health Services shares guidance to help our campus community mitigate the spread of respiratory viruses like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19. </summary><start-date>1671177600000</start-date><display-name>Community health guidance for returning from winter break</display-name><path>/2022/12/winter-return-health-guidance</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/winter-return-health-guidance</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1671224863362</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1671224863362</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>Dear UC Santa Cruz students,</span></p>
<p><span>We hope you are enjoying winter break to the fullest. We are writing to share guidance to help our campus community mitigate the spread of respiratory viruses like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19. Because these three viruses are spreading at the same time, we want to be sure all Banana Slugs are equipped with the information they need to prioritize personal health and our community&#8217;s well-being this winter. Following the guidelines below will not only limit the spread of viruses during the break but will also help our community as we return for the start of the winter quarter.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><u>COVID-19 Winter Break Testing Guidance</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span>We strongly encourage all community members to take a COVID-19 rapid antigen test before returning to campus, especially if you:</span><span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Develop symptoms</span></li>
<li><span>Have known contact with a positive COVID case</span></li>
<li><span>Travel to an area where infection rates are high</span></li>
<li><span><a contenteditable="false" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Beyond-Blueprint-QA.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Beyond-Blueprint-QA.aspx"><span>Attend a high risk event</span></a></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you test positive for COVID, please delay your return to campus and follow these </span><span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/covid_positive_directions_students.pdf">COVID-19 Positive Test Result Instructions</a></span><span>. If you test negative for COVID and you still have </span><span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">COVID-19 symptoms</a></span><span>,</span> <span>complete another rapid antigen test 48 hours after the first negative test, for a total of at least two tests. The </span><span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/self-testing.html#:&#126;:text=The%20test%20did%20not%20detect,virus%20that%20causes%20COVID%2D19.">CDC advises that multiple negative tests</a></span><span> increases the confidence that you are not infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span>If you get a negative result on the second test and you are concerned that you could have COVID-19, you may test again 48 hours after the second test, consider getting a laboratory molecular-based test, or call your healthcare provider.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if your COVID tests are negative, do not return to campus if you have flu-like symptoms to help prevent the spread of flu and RSV in our community. </span><span>If you are not able to attend class, notify your instructor as soon as possible.</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span><strong>Need a test? </strong></span><span>Starting today, every U.S. household can again order four, free at-home COVID-</span><span>&#8288;</span><span>19 tests via </span><span><a href="https://www.covid.gov/tests">https://www.covid.gov/tests</a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to these testing guidelines, the </span><span><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/Communications-Toolkits/Winter-Virus-Prevention.aspx">California Department of Public Health</a></span><span> offers these five tips to protect yourself and others from winter viruses:</span></p>
<p><span><strong><u>Tip #1: Get Vaccinated, Boosted (and Treated)</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Flu and COVID-19 vaccines continue to be the best defense to limit severe illness and death&#8212;and you can get both at the same time. If you test positive for COVID-19 and wish to </span><span><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/treatment/">receive antiviral treatment</a></span><span>, contact your doctor or a</span> <span><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/treatment/#how-to-find-treatment">test-to-treat site</a></span> <span>immediately.</span><span>Treatments work best when started right after symptoms begin.</span></p>
<p><span>For off-campus, low- to no-cost vaccine options in your area, go to</span> <span><a href="http://vaccines.gov/">vaccines.gov</a></span><span>. UC SHIP members can use their Optum pharmacy benefits at</span> <span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/immunizations.html#faqs">these locations</a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><u>Tip #2: Stay Home if You're Sick </u></strong></span></p>
<p><span>If you are feeling sick, </span><span>it could be COVID-19, flu or RSV. Stay home and away from others, take a COVID-19 test, and call your doctor if you have any symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, new loss of taste or smell, or sore throat.</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span><strong><u>Tip #3: Wear a Mask</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span>There is no vaccine for RSV, so wearing a mask can significantly slow the spread and protect babies and young children who do not yet have immunity and are too young to wear a mask themselves. Wearing a mask in indoor public places is a good way to limit the spread of germs.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><u>Tip #4: Wash Your Hands</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Frequent handwashing with soap and warm water&#8212;for at least 20 seconds, is an easy and very effective way to prevent getting sick and spreading germs.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><u>Tip #5: Cover Your Cough or Sneeze</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Remember to cough or sneeze into your elbow, your arm, or a disposable tissue to help prevent the spread of winter viruses. Just make sure to wash your hands or sanitize and dispose of your tissue after.</span></p>
<p><span>Winter break offers our campus community the opportunity to rest, recharge, and connect with friends and family. We hope you are able to enjoy the break in all the ways you desire. We thank you, in advance, for doing your part to mitigate the spread of viruses and promote community wellness.</span></p>
<p><span>We look forward to seeing you in winter quarter!</span></p>

<p><span>The message below from Letitia Silas, Executive Director of Systemwide Labor Relations, shares more information about the tentative agreements.</span></p>
<p><span>The past weeks have been challenging for many people in our campus community, particularly our undergraduates. I appreciate everyone&#8217;s patience while UC and the UAW negotiated. I am hopeful that both units will ratify the agreements and that our winter quarter will start as anticipated.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p><span>After months of negotiations, a strike, and disruptions on our campuses, I am pleased to inform you that UC has reached a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW) regarding the Graduate Student Researchers (GSR) and Academic Student Employees (ASE) contracts. Union members are expected to vote on the tentative agreements in the coming days.</span></p>
<p><span>With these agreements, student employees are expected to return to work and cease any picketing.</span></p>
<p><span>The tentative agreements include new minimum salary scales for Academic Student Employees, including Teaching Assistants, and Graduate Student Researchers, as well as multiyear pay increases, paid dependent access to university health care and enhanced paid family leave.</span></p>
<p><span>Additional information about the agreements is available </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-reaches-tentative-agreements-uaw-mediated-mayor-steinberg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1671573763197000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Hev3jXnKO0dnZBXppKYTb" href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-reaches-tentative-agreements-uaw-mediated-mayor-steinberg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>here</span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe these agreements honor the vital contributions our ASEs and GSRs make to UC&#8217;s teaching and research activities and uphold UC&#8217;s tradition of supporting them with compensation and benefits packages that are among the best in the country. The agreements also help ensure that UC continues to be extremely competitive as a top research institution.</span></p>
<p><span>Following the strike, we will be working to restore healthy relationships across the system including healthy labor-management relations. On behalf of everyone at the Office of the President who has been involved with these negotiations, I want to thank all members of the University community for their patience and commitment during this challenging period. I also want to thank our campus labor relations and academic personnel colleagues for their partnership throughout the negotiations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual competition is centered around a realistic cybersecurity scenario, where students must carry out a series of reverse engineering, cybersecurity-related tasks to earn points. While students compete individually, points are combined with other student participants from their university, ranking the schools based on total points accumulated. UCSC achieved a total score of 79,011 in the competition, which concluded on December 9.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this year&#8217;s scenario, participants took on the role of NSA employees, providing technical assistance to the FBI on a ransomware incident investigation. Over a series of nine tasks, each with an increasing level of difficulty, participants investigated the cyber attack, discovered the tools and techniques used during the attack, exposed the ransomware, and recovered the compromised files.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight of the UCSC students who participated completed all nine challenge tasks, earning NSA certificates. Those students are Jeffrey Zhang, Brian Mak, Steven Mak, Nancy Lau, Iakov Taranenko, Jackson Kohls, Maxwell Kunes, and Victor Ho.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The competition is structured to give students the opportunity to gain and apply cybersecurity skills such as computer forensics, reverse engineering, software development, and web analysis.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are so many different approaches to cybersecurity. In addition to computer forensics, reverse engineering, and the need to use different programs and tools, you also have to apply deductive reasoning and critical thinking skills. All of those aspects are very important to solving cyber attacks, &#8221; said Iakov Taranenko, a first-year proposed computer engineering major who began competing in cybersecurity competitions while in high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the cybersecurity industry continues to expand, so does student interest in cybersecurity research and opportunities at UC Santa Cruz. To meet the growing interest, Baskin Engineering students Tarenenko and Nancy Lau have formed the </span><a href="https://be-ssc.sites.ucsc.edu/blog/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Security Club</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Their goal is to build and support a community of students who are interested in cyber and physical systems security.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students from all majors are welcome, and do not need to have prior cybersecurity experience to join. Club meetings will begin winter quarter 2023 with a plan to frequently host lectures and workshops that revolve around learning and applying cyber and physical systems security concepts.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="31cb783d8072704640ce426174176f1a"><name>planning-for-winter-quarter</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Planning for Winter Quarter</title><summary>Earlier today, the University of California Office of the President shared more information about tentative agreements with the UAW regarding contracts for Academic Student Employees and Graduate Student Researchers. </summary><start-date>1671436800000</start-date><display-name>Planning for Winter Quarter</display-name><path>/2022/12/planning-for-winter-quarter</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/12/planning-for-winter-quarter</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1671577696297</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1671577696297</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>Earlier today, the University of California Office of the President shared more information about tentative agreements with the UAW regarding contracts for Academic Student Employees and Graduate Student Researchers. The tentative agreements provide minimum salary scales for academic student employees, including teaching assistants and graduate student researchers, as well as multiyear pay increases, paid dependent access to university health care, enhanced child care expense reimbursement, and enhanced paid family leave. Members will vote on the proposals this week. If approved, the contracts will be effective through May 31, 2025.</span></p>
<p><span>As we wrap up fall quarter and look to winter quarter, we want to acknowledge the uncertainty of this moment caused by the spreading of respiratory diseases and the as-yet uncertain end to the UAW labor strikes involving ASEs and GSRS. We write to share some initial information, guidance, and resources to support our instructors, knowing that many of you are already concerned about how to plan your courses in advance of the start of winter quarter instruction on January 9.</span></p>
<p><span>We will share important updates as they become available, including through the time of campus closure, if there is anything significant to report. We encourage you to check email periodically through the winter break.</span></p>
<p><span>We should all be planning for a number of scenarios we might face in January. While we are hopeful that UAW members will ratify the tentative agreement, instructors should plan for the possibility that the strike may continue into the start of winter quarter. Additionally, instructors should also anticipate that some students (or they themselves or family and household members) may be ill when instruction starts, which may affect in-person class meetings. In particular, instructors should consider whether they are open to temporarily offering blended modalities for students who are ill, or whether they want to find other ways to support students to keep learning while they are sick.</span></p>
<p><span>We encourage you to begin thinking through your instructional plans and communicating in advance with students to share your plans. Students in courses scheduled to be in person may seek confirmation of the first class session&#8217;s modality. We will be encouraging students to look for messages from instructors about their winter quarter courses. We encourage you to build flexibility into your courses, and to include language in your syllabi reminding students that the syllabus and assignments may be subject to change in response to situations as they arise, as well as how you will be communicating with students throughout the quarter. Syllabus plans related to student illness should be developed without requesting medical documentation of illness. Instructors should not ask students to provide medical documentation of illness or proof of a positive test result (see the </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://senate.ucsc.edu/committees/cep-committee-on-educational-policy/policies-guidelines/cep-student-health-center-policy-on-medical-excuses-100919.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1671640913315000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ws_cS8Zmiz27jNH2nViKk" href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/committees/cep-committee-on-educational-policy/policies-guidelines/cep-student-health-center-policy-on-medical-excuses-100919.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Academic Senate&#8217;s document</span></a></span><span> on this point).</span></p>

<p>The new findings, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2206742119">published the week of December 26 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, indicate that the growth of the ice sheets&#8212;and the resulting drop in sea level&#8212;occurred surprisingly quickly and much later in the glacial cycle than previous studies had suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that more than 50 percent of the global ice volume at the Last Glacial Maximum grew after 46,000 years ago,&#8221; said Tamara Pico, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz and a corresponding author of the paper. &#8220;This is important for understanding the feedbacks between climate and ice sheets, because it implies that there was a substantial delay in the development of ice sheets after global temperatures dropped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Global sea levels drop during ice ages as more and more of Earth&#8217;s water gets locked up in massive ice sheets, but the timing of these processes has been hard to pin down. During the Last Glacial Maximum, which lasted from about 26,500 to 19,000 years ago, ice sheets covered large areas of North America. Dramatically lower sea levels uncovered a vast land area known as Beringia that extended from Siberia to Alaska and supported herds of horses, mammoths, and other Pleistocene fauna. As the ice sheets melted, the Bering Strait became flooded again around 13,000 to 11,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The new findings are interesting in relation to human migration because they shorten the time between the opening of the land bridge and the arrival of humans in the Americas. The timing of human migration into North America remains unresolved, but some studies suggest people may have lived in Beringia throughout the height of the ice age.</p>
<p>&#8220;People may have started going across as soon as the land bridge formed,&#8221; Pico said.</p>
<p>The new study used an analysis of nitrogen isotopes in seafloor sediments to determine when the Bering Strait was flooded during the past 46,000 years, allowing Pacific Ocean water to flow into the Arctic Ocean. First author Jesse Farmer at Princeton University led the isotope analysis, measuring nitrogen isotope ratios in the remains of marine plankton preserved in sediment cores collected from the seafloor at three locations in the western Arctic Ocean. Because of differences in the nitrogen composition of Pacific and Arctic waters, Farmer was able to identify a nitrogen isotope signature indicating when Pacific water flowed into the Arctic.</p>
<p>Pico, whose expertise is in sea level modeling, then compared Farmer&#8217;s results with sea level models based on different scenarios for the growth of the ice sheets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exciting thing to me is that this provides a completely independent constraint on global sea level during this time period,&#8221; Pico said. &#8220;Some of the ice sheet histories that have been proposed differ by quite a lot, and we were able to look at what the predicted sea level would be at the Bering Strait and see which ones are consistent with the nitrogen data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The results support recent studies indicating that global sea levels were much higher prior to the Last Glacial Maximum than previous estimates had suggested, she said. Average global sea level during the Last Glacial Maximum was about 130 meters (425 feet) lower than today. The actual sea level at a particular site such as the Bering Strait, however, depends on factors such as the deformation of the Earth&#8217;s crust by the weight of the ice sheets.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like punching down on bread dough&#8212;the crust sinks under the ice and rises up around the edges,&#8221; Pico said. &#8220;Also, the ice sheets are so massive they have gravitational effects on the water. I model those processes to see how sea level would vary around the world and, in this case, to look at the Bering Strait.&#8221;</p>
<p>The findings imply a complicated relationship between climate and global ice volume and suggest new avenues for investigating the mechanisms underlying glacial cycles.</p>
