(Credit: Ricardo Yarza et al.)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>When our sun exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core some 5 billion years from now, it will expand to become a red giant, engulfing the inner planets. The dynamics and possible outcomes of planetary engulfment are poorly understood, but it is thought to be a relatively common fate for planetary systems.</p>
<p>A new study using hydrodynamical simulations reveals the forces acting on a planet when it is swallowed by an expanding star. The results show that the interactions of a substellar body (a planet or brown dwarf) with the hot gas in the outer envelope of a sun-like star can lead to a range of outcomes depending on the size of the engulfed object and the stage of the star&#8217;s evolution.</p>
<p>Lead author Ricardo Yarza at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will present the new findings on June 13, 2022, at the <a href="https://aas.org/meetings/aas240">240th meeting of the American Astronomical Society</a> (AAS) in Pasadena.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evolved stars can be hundreds or even thousands of times larger than their planets, and this disparity of scales makes it difficult to perform simulations that accurately model the physical processes occurring at each scale,&#8221; said Yarza, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC. &#8220;Instead, we simulate a small section of the star centered on the planet to understand the flow around the planet and measure the drag forces acting on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The results may help explain recent observations of planets and brown dwarfs closely orbiting stellar remnants such as white dwarfs and subdwarfs. Previous studies have suggested that these systems may be the end result of a planetary engulfment process that involves shrinking of the engulfed body&#8217;s orbit and ejection of the outer layers of the star.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the planet travels inside the star, drag forces transfer energy from the planet to the star, and the stellar envelope can become unbound if the transferred energy exceeds its binding energy,&#8221; Yarza explained.</p>
<p>According to the calculations by Yarza and his colleagues, no substellar bodies smaller than about 100 times the mass of Jupiter can eject the envelope of a sun-like star before it has expanded to about 10 times the radius of the sun. At later stages of stellar evolution and expansion, however, the stellar envelope could be ejected by an object as small as ten times the mass of Jupiter, which would shrink its orbit by several orders of magnitude in the process.</p>
<p>The study also found that planetary engulfment can increase the luminosity of a sun-like star by several orders of magnitude for up to several thousand years, depending on the mass of the engulfed object and the evolutionary stage of the star.</p>
<p>The framework provided by this study can be incorporated into future work to explore the effect of engulfment on the structure of the star. &#8220;Our work can inform simulations of planetary engulfment at the scale of the star by providing an accurate reference picture of the physics at the scale of the planet,&#8221; Yarza said.</p>
<p>A great variety of planetary systems have now been described by exoplanet search programs. As these systems evolve, a significant fraction are likely to undergo planetary engulfment. &#8220;We believe it is relatively common,&#8221; Yarza said.</p>
<p>A paper on the new findings has been submitted for publication in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em> and is available online at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11227">arxiv.org/abs/2203.11227</a>. The senior authors of the paper are Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, and Dongwook Lee, associate professor of applied mathematics, both at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz said he was impressed by Yarza&#8217;s work on this project. &#8220;There are many ingredients for success at the highest levels of astrophysics research, including creativity, palate in the selection of key questions, strength and range of knowledge, ability to communicate scientific results, technical mastery, and independence. Ricardo stands out in that his vector is large in all of these fundamental dimensions,&#8221; he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2124bb398072704664be42b445e3a4ba"><name>anticipated-salary-increase</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Anticipated salary increase for policy-covered staff and academic appointees, update on staff salary equity program</title><summary>We are excited to share that all eligible policy-covered staff employees will receive a 4.5 percent salary increase, and senate faculty and policy-covered academic appointees will receive a 4 percent salary increase, pending approval of the state budget.</summary><start-date>1654066800000</start-date><display-name>Anticipated salary increase for policy-covered staff and academic appointees, update on staff salary equity program</display-name><path>/2022/06/anticipated-salary-increase</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/anticipated-salary-increase</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1654118464294</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1654118464294</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Everyday, staff and faculty members at UC Santa Cruz support and further our mission, increase our impact, and support the success of our students.

<p>Salary increases are effective July 1, 2022 for monthly paid employees and June 26, 2022 for bi-weekly paid employees. Monthly employees should see the increases on their August 1, 2022 paycheck, and biweekly employees should see the increase on their July 20, 2022 paycheck.</p>
<p>For faculty, the salary increase will be effective October 1, 2022, and reflected on the November 1, 2022 paycheck. More information about the campus academic salary program, including an Academic Salary Equity Program, will be available soon.</p>
<p>Our staff and faculty members have done an incredible job over the past year, and we&#8217;re so pleased that they will be recognized in this way. More details regarding eligibility and any updates to pay dates will be communicated as details become available.</p>
<p><strong>Update on staff equity program</strong><br/>This salary increase builds on the $5.5 million allocated in our three-year staff equity program that we implemented earlier this academic year. Our three-year program is designed to target employees whose salaries are furthest below market, and is predominantly impacting employees in lower salary grades.</p>
<p>During the first year of the program, the campus invested $2.5 million, which increased the salaries of more than 1,300 policy-covered employees with 71 percent of the funds going to employees who were at or below the 25th percentile. Salary increases ranged from less than 1 percent to 6 percent with an average increase of 2.46 percent translating to an average annual salary increase of $1,841.</p>
<p>In the second year of the staff equity program, we will invest an additional $1.5 million. Compensation levels of policy-covered staff will be reviewed in fall so that increases can be implemented in early 2023.</p>
<p>We deeply appreciate the contributions by our staff and faculty, and hope that our focus on equitable compensation will make UC Santa Cruz an even better place to work.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>Cynthia Larive Chancellor and Lori Kletzer Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="21a277028072704664be42b420fcfad9"><name>mcclellan-ufugusuku-lex-un</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Seeking Okinawan rights</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz doctoral candidate Lex McClellan-Ufugusuku appeared before the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, exploring whether the people of Okinawa could be recognized as Indigenous—meaning they might have the right to block or stop new military bases under guidelines about Indigenous people set up by the U.N.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p>In April of this year, UC Santa Cruz doctoral candidate Lex McClellan-Ufugusuku sat in front of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and described how the construction of a new U.S. military base in Okinawa was being undertaken despite its environmental problems and against the strong objections of those who live on the island.<br/><br/>Her statement rose out of her doctoral research into the complexities of the small island with big strategic significance located in the East China Sea. Now ruled by Japan, the island is home to 32 U.S. military installations to which many Okinawans object, according to McClellan-Ufugusuku. If, however, the people of Okinawa were to be recognized as Indigenous, they might have the right to block or stop the presence or expansion of these facilities under guidelines about Indigenous people set up by the United Nations, said McClellan-Ufugusuku. It's a tricky situation.<br/><br/>It&#8217;s also personal. <br/><br/>McClellan-Ufugusuku is mixed-race Shimanchu, a descendant of those who live on the island of Okinawa. <br/><br/>Born in San Diego, McClellan-Ufugusuku (College Nine) came to UC Santa Cruz as an undergraduate specifically to work on the Okinawa Memories Initiative under the direction of History Professor Alan Christy. The initiative explores and documents the early years of the U.S. military presence on Okinawa. Earning a bachelor&#8217;s degree in history and critical race and ethnic studies in 2018, McClellan-Ufugusuku went on to graduate school on campus. <br/><br/>Speaking by phone, McClellan-Ufugusuku said she was driven in her research by thoughts of her obaachan (grandmother), Michicko Cappalla Oshiro. <br/><br/>&#8220;She has a basic education that she got during the U.S. military period in Okinawa,&#8221; said McClellan-Ufugusuku. &#8220;She told me stories about running into the sugar cane fields on her way home from school so she could hide and read before she had to go home and do her work.&#8221;<br/><br/>Arriving in the U.S. in the 1980s, McClellan-Ufugusuku&#8217;s grandmother labored her whole life, holding onto her heritage and pride in being Ryukyuan (Okinawan) despite the fact it would have been easier to be assimilated into the American culture, McClellan-Ufugusuku said.<br/><br/>Combining the study of government documents along with conducting oral histories of Shimanchu both in Okinawa and in the diaspora, McClellan-Ufugusuku said her doctoral research explores not only how the Shimanchu culture and language are slipping away &#8220;in light of ongoing Japanese assimilation policies&#8221; but also how that leads to environmental harm to her ancestral land.<br/><br/>Telling the story of the contested relocation of the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to Henoko Bay in Okinawa, McClellan-Ufugusuku spoke of the damage to coral reefs and how the remains of Okinawans killed during the 1945 Battle of Okinawa have been discovered in the dredged soil slated for use as landfill.<br/><br/>&#8220;Our ancestors are being made into a runway and we will never get them back&#8230; They have been killed twice,&#8221; McClellan-Ufugusuku said.<br/><br/>The bases&#8212;there are 13 on the island&#8212;also have contributed to the presence of possibly carcinogenic chemicals in the drinking water near these sites, she said. A 2019 study by two Kyoto University professors, for instance, found high levels of PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) both in the blood of citizens and in rivers near a U.S. air base. The chemical was used in fire-extinguishing foam. Crimes committed by U.S. soldiers on the island are another problem, McClellan-Ufugusuku said.<br/><br/>If Okinawans were recognized as Indigenous, however, they might have rights under the U.N. Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People to have access to their land without fear of military violence and also to have a voice in whether new installations can be built, she said. Still, many older Okinawans object to being called Indigenous because of how the term was used to exclude people in the past and was seen as shameful, McClellan-Ufugusuku said. <br/><br/>The thousands of people who are part of the Okinawan diaspora, especially the young, see it as a struggle for their rights, however.<br/><br/>The importance of her research is about &#8220;survivency,&#8221; said McClellan-Ufugusuku, who appeared at the U.N. as the lone representative of the Ryukuan people. &#8220;Survivency means reclaiming our history, our cultural practices, and our languages.&#8221;<br/><br/>McClellan-Ufugusuku&#8217;s appearance before the U.N., said Professor Christy, was an example of <br/>the 26-year-old&#8217;s bravery in pushing through anxieties about being in uncomfortable situations in order to do what is needed, a character trait he has seen throughout her years at UC Santa Cruz. It&#8217;s also how McClellan-Ufugusuku has been able to create a global network of Okinawans and their descendants as part of her research. <br/><br/>Her focus on a small place that has global significance is important, Christy said. &#8220;She is working on a key issue that is at the heart of everything that will become of increasing significance&#8221; in the years ahead.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, McClellan-Ufugusuku has undertaken another role at UC Santa Cruz. Besides teaching, she is also head coach of the women&#8217;s lacrosse team on campus, a squad that is ranked No. 5 in Division II of the Western Women&#8217;s Lacrosse League.</p>

<h2>Gearing up for commencement</h2>
<p>Graduation is such an exciting time at UC Santa Cruz. Family, friends and our campus community will join together next week to celebrate all that the Class of 2022 has accomplished.</p>
<p>Commencement 2022 will be a combination of virtual and in-person experiences. Virtual commencement will launch on June 9 at 4 p.m. on the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commencement.ucsc.edu&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1654290677743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2bHYcjsz7qiAfsDH5C7hjH" href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commencement website</a> and will be available to view until this time next year. Slug Crossing, our in-person commencement ceremonies, will happen from June 9&#8211;12 on the East Field. The <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commencement.ucsc.edu/checklist/index.html%23slug-crossing&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1654290677743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2EtO5UeLdS_n0TRhJlI4fm" href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu/checklist/index.html#slug-crossing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">schedule is online</a>.</p>
<p>Faculty and staff can support this year&#8217;s commencement activities in two ways. The first is to attend and <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/05/slug-crossing-cheering-section.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1654290677743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1J5vkcUeNYJj4n8BGqEGl7" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/05/slug-crossing-cheering-section.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cheer on our graduates</a> who are participating in Slug Crossing. Employees can also volunteer to <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0e4fa4a62ba1f8c07-2022&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1654290677743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3JFCbw64MVMlDd5chpXVM-" href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0e4fa4a62ba1f8c07-2022" rel="noopener" target="_blank">help Slug Crossing run smoothly</a>.</p>
<p>We are also celebrating our graduates by asking friends, family, faculty, and staff to <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://celebrate.ucsc.edu/messages/create&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1654290677743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw152BnbbBkRnxuvJJAgI6iU" href="https://celebrate.ucsc.edu/messages/create" rel="noopener" target="_blank">submit brief congratulatory notes</a>.

<h2>Celebrating Pride month</h2>
<p>June marks the start of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) Pride Month. It&#8217;s a time to celebrate the success that the LGBTQIA+ community has had in creating a more inclusive and equitable world. However, we should all recognize that those advancements are under attack with some states passing discriminatory legislation that targets members of the LGBTQIA+ community. UC Santa Cruz leadership stands opposed to these efforts and we must all speak out against these efforts.</p>
<p>One opportunity to learn more and show your support is by attending <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://santacruzpride.org&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1654290677743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2aWT-1j4w7Q3CSOO9ZiFgz" href="http://santacruzpride.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Santa Cruz Pride 2022</a>. Established 47 years ago, our city is home to the third-oldest Pride Parade and Festival in California. Santa Cruz Pride 2022 starts Friday with a film screening and continues through the weekend with additional events.</p>
<p>I am proud to be joining a group of UC Santa Cruz community members who will be participating in the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://santacruzpride.org&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1654290677743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2aWT-1j4w7Q3CSOO9ZiFgz" href="http://santacruzpride.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">47th annual Santa Cruz Pride parade</a>, and I encourage our community to head downtown and cheer on all the participants. The parade starts at 11 a.m. Sunday, June 5 on Pacific Avenue between Cathcart and Church streets.</p>
<h2>Professor among Time magazine&#8217;s 100 most influential people</h2>
<p>I was delighted to see Karen Miga, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering, named one of the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2022/6177818/evan-eichler-karen-miga-adam-phillippy-michael-schatz/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1654290677743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0zbjIwd8ZXCmWoTdpkSX2G" href="https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2022/6177818/evan-eichler-karen-miga-adam-phillippy-michael-schatz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">100 most influential people of 2022 by Time</a>&#160;magazine.</p>
<p>Professor Miga and three colleagues from other institutions led an international team of scientists&#8212;known as the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium (or T2T)&#8212;that April 1 released the first truly complete sequence of a human genome, covering each chromosome from end to end with no gaps and unprecedented accuracy. This scientific feat opens up new territories for scientists, with a promise of practical applications in the realm of personalized medicine and advances our understanding of human diversity and evolution.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful achievement for Karen, and highlights the transformational biomolecular science taking place at UC Santa Cruz. Our campus is proud of our long history of pioneering research advances in this field. The first working draft of a human genome was assembled at UCSC in 2000, which led to enormous leaps in our collective understanding of human biology and disease.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s Double the Pell</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is a social mobility engine, delivering a world-class education to a diverse student body that includes low income and first-generation students. This broad access to higher education is driven in large part by the Pell Grant, the federal financial aid program that helps low-income students afford college. The program was created in 1972 and every year it opens the doors of higher education for millions of students.</p>
<p>Nearly a third of UC Santa Cruz undergraduates are supported by Pell Grants, providing critical financial support. For more than a year, the University of California and many other champions of higher education have called on Congress to double the Pell Grant&#8217;s maximum award to $13,000.</p>
<p>Doubling the Pell would directly support our students&#8212;and millions more&#8212;by reducing the need for loans, supporting basic needs and ultimately helping students graduate from the university.</p>
<p>June 23 marks the Pell Program&#8217;s 50th anniversary, and the University of California and the UC Student Association are celebrating this milestone by asking people to <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/double-the-pell?p2asource%3Dpellbdayucsc1%23card&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1654290677743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0XMR_IbLWRRBPJUi0QOOfA" href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/double-the-pell?p2asource=pellbdayucsc1#card" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sign an online birthday card that will be delivered to Congress</a>. I signed&#8212;and I encourage you to do so, too.</p>
<h2>Sign up for Summer Session</h2>
<p>While summer can be a time for internships and jobs, vacations, and taking a break, it also provides opportunities for students to make progress toward their educational goals. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://summer.ucsc.edu/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1654290677743000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2yt-zPMZQLfRIaBZorDFLb" href="https://summer.ucsc.edu/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Summer Session</a> continues to expand offerings to meet students&#8217; needs and has grown in popularity. There&#8217;s still time to add classes and significant grant funding is available for students eligible for financial aid.</p>
<p>A wide array of courses are available online and in-person to complete major or general education requirements. Summer Session classes are open to everyone, so faculty, staff, alumni, community members and even high school students can learn from our stellar instructors.</p>

Kimmey will receive a $300,000 award over four years to support her research on the role of circadian rhythms in susceptibility to infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Bacteria such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, can cause infections that are either asymptomatic or life-threatening. According to Kimmey, this variability may be influenced by our circadian clock, the cellular timekeeping system that regulates our daily rhythms in sleeping, eating, and a variety of physiological responses, including immune system dynamics.</p>
<p>Many studies have found links between disease and disruptions of this biological clock. For example, shift workers&#8212;whose circadian rhythms are frequently disrupted&#8212;are more prone to developing respiratory infections.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lot of evidence that circadian rhythms affect disease outcomes, but there has not been a lot of research to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms,&#8221; Kimmey said.</p>
<p>Her lab has found that exposure to a variety of bacteria resets the circadian &#8220;time&#8221; of mammalian cells by boosting the levels of a core component of the molecular clock. Kimmey is now working to identify the bacterial components that trigger this reset, track how the clock&#8217;s molecular components respond during live infection in zebrafish, and determine how the time of infection affects disease severity in mice.</p>
<p>This research involves an array of cutting-edge techniques in molecular genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and pharmacology. The results could lead to novel strategies for using the body&#8217;s clock to boost our natural immunity to infectious disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;The long-term goal of my research is to understand what underlies variation in infectious disease outcomes,&#8221; Kimmey said. &#8220;Circadian rhythms are a huge variable that is not well understood. What time you get exposed could make the difference between getting pneumonia or not, but we don&#8217;t know how that works.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kimmey earned her Ph.D. in molecular microbiology and microbial pathogenesis in 2016 from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. After a postdoctoral fellowship at UC San Diego, she joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2019.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/pew-biomedical-scholars">Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences</a> provides funding to young investigators of outstanding promise in science relevant to the advancement of human health.

working groups through the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/crossing-latinidades-grant.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crossing Latinidades</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project, a nationwide consortium of R1 designated Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Ten working groups in total were funded, for two years each, among the consortium&#8217;s 16 member institutions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin American and Latino Studies (LALS) Department Chair Catherine Ram&#237;rez will lead one of the groups, which will include two other senior scholars and several graduate student fellows from Crossing Latinidades partner universities. The research team will explore the theme of &#8220;bioprecarity,&#8221; or the physical experiences of vulnerability and risk among Latinx immigrants in the United States. Specifically, the team will focus on medical abuse and neglect in immigrant detention facilities, captivity in the borderlands, and how the processes of youth and aging interact with U.S. immigration policy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bioprecarity is essentially embodied vulnerability, and the body is an important site for concretizing the concept of precarity, which is otherwise pretty abstract,&#8221; Ram&#237;rez explained. &#8220;For example, this country has a need for young workers, but once they get older or are no longer considered productive, what happens to them, especially if their immigration status is precarious? I want to study youth as a resource that has been extracted from immigrants as they&#8217;ve waited for immigration reform.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another research group, led by UCSC Professor of Literature Kirsten Silva Gruesz, will focus on the theme of the Latinx past, combining archival research methods with literary and historical analysis. The group will include three lead faculty researchers, three additional collaborating faculty, and graduate students from Crossing Latinidades member institutions. The research team will visit archives across the country with collections focused on a variety of Latinx ethno-national identities. These materials will offer a starting point for speculations about the past, present, and future that may enter into the realm of creative writing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are not primarily a group of historians, so we are not as focused on trying to ascertain what actually happened as we are on the bigger question of memory itself,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How does the nation either remember or fail to remember the places and moments where Latinx people have entered the national story? That's where the work that creative writers are doing has been so powerful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two doctoral students from UCSC&#8217;s Latin American and Latino Studies Department have also been selected to join Crossing Latinidades national research working groups through a one-year fellowship program. Mario Gomez-Zamora&#8217;s research focuses on queer Indigenous P&#8217;urh&#233;pecha histories and colonial violence in Michoac&#225;n, Mexico. And Jennifer Figueroa studies how Latino parents in Ventura County have organized for equity in education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing from other scholars and scholars-in-the-making who are asking similar questions about how we can expand our thinking on educational issues for Latinx people in the U.S. from an asset-based perspective,&#8221; Figueroa said. &#8220;My research is going to be infinitely enriched by having this dedicated time together to think about these issues.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figueroa and Gomez-Zamora will also attend a Crossing Latinidades summer institute focused on interdisciplinary research methods and will participate in a mentorship program. Both are looking forward to the opportunity to build their skills and expand their networks. Ultimately, one of the goals of the Crossing Latinidades consortium is to increase the number of Latinx students pursuing terminal degrees and advancing to academic positions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think this program will really help to prepare me for a potential academic job, but also to better contribute to my community,&#8221; Gomez-Zamora said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a first-generation college student and an immigrant, and after generations where my parents and grandparents were not able to get higher education, I want to show what we can do. I have a chance to pursue a different dream of collaborating with my community to create knowledge together.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2b4dbdb68072704664be42b448853458"><name>shs-june-closures</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Upcoming closures for Student Health Center, SHOP, and CAPS</title><summary>Student Health Services will close early on Friday, June 10, 2022 and for the full day on Monday, June 20.</summary><start-date>1654239600000</start-date><display-name>Upcoming closures for Student Health Center, SHOP, and CAPS</display-name><path>/2022/06/shs-june-closures</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/shs-june-closures</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1654288924063</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1654637944344</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>To: </strong>All UC Santa Cruz Students</p>

<p><strong>Subject:&#160;</strong>COVID-19: What to do during finals week</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Dear UC Santa Cruz students,</p>
<p>As the spring quarter comes to a close, we write to provide guidance for completing your finals amid the rise in <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=California&amp;data-type=CommunityLevels&amp;list_select_county=6087">local COVID-19 cases</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>To begin, we wish to remind everyone that the university <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/05/indoor-masking-encouraged1.html?utm_source=05-31-2022&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tuesday-newsday">strongly recommends the use of masks in all indoor settings</a>. Free surgical masks are available at <a href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html">various campus locations</a>. Doing all you can to mitigate COVID-19 spread is not only important to community well-being.: mitigation strategies such as masking could be the key to completing your final exams as scheduled.&#160;</p>
<p>Recognizing some may become ill with COVID-19 in the coming days, this message offers&#160; instructions about what to do if you are scheduled to take a final AND have symptoms of COVID-19 and/or test positive for COVID-19.&#160;</p>
<p>Note: If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and/or test positive for COVID-19, do not attend an in-person final. Instead, follow the instructions below:&#160;</p>
<p><strong>If you have symptoms of COVID-19:</strong></p>

The group used the drones to map slight differences in the topography of the field in order to better understand which areas of habitat the species prefers and potentially determine the best ways to protect them.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This field research was part of the first-ever drone Pilot Training Program put on by the <a href="https://cider.sites.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s2">UCSC CITRIS Initiative for Drone Education and Research (CIDER)</span></a>, which aims to support drone research and industry to develop a diverse drone workforce. CIDER launched this new program with a cohort of 18 undergraduate students with a range of academic interests who met twice a week for classroom and field instruction about drones.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The CIDER Pilot Training Program is a great way to provide students with training and skills that have real world value, and to really enjoy that learning process,&#8221; said Becca Fenwick, Director of CIDER. &#8220;There is such a wide variety of ways that drones can be used that there is something for everyone &#8211; from engineering challenges, applications in marine conservation, to videography, and beyond. We call them the swiss army knife of the air.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The CIDER program aims to reduce barriers to entry into drone research and industry by providing access to and the opportunity to gain flight hours with expensive drone hardware. Many of the students in the first cohort were from underserved backgrounds prioritized by the CIDER program, which includes students with demonstrated financial need and those from communities underrepresented in STEM.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the 10 week-long program, the students' training included lessons on operating drone hardware, applications for drone technology, and training with drone software such as GIS and other data processing tools. Students in the pilot training program could also train and test to receive a FAA part 107 license, making them legally authorized commercial drone pilots, with the CIDER program covering the testing fees.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Second-year marine biology student Isabella Garfield noted measuring the Ohlone tiger beetle terrain as one of her favorite parts of the pilot training program. This experience, and the program as a whole, further sparked her interest in developing an expertise in drone technology to carve out a niche for herself within her field. She hopes to bring the skills she learned to her work as an intern in the Beltran lab at UCSC, where efforts are underway to leverage drone technology to count and measure the health of elephant seal populations.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Being drone certified and having the background that I got from the CIDER program has definitely given me the tools to have that extra option open if I want to incorporate [drones into a future job],&#8221; Garfield said. &#8220;I can see that happening.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this way, the pilot training program serves as a potential pathway for students to take on complex scientific research work using drones. Four students from this years&#8217; cohort work for&#160; research labs on campus, and one more is participating in the UCSC Earth Futures Institute Frontiers Fellows Program this summer, which provides funding to support multidisciplinary environmental research.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students can also build up flight hours during the program and through on-campus paid contract work, using drones to execute work such as building inspections or photography and videography of events. In the future, students can use their skills to support research flights for faculty and conduct environmental surveys for external partners.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These paid experiences can help make students better prepared to use drones in an industry setting. Two students from the cohort have paid internships at CIDER industry partners, working for companies which use drone technology for agriculture and wildfire applications. Two more students have received full-time job offers at industry partner </span><span class="s3">Skydio, which designs and sells drones.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Matthew Bennett, a graduating fifth-year student who majored in robotics engineering, credits the CIDER program for preparing him with both the technical knowledge and field experience with drones to successfully land a job as a flight test operator at Skydio. He notes that learning how drones react to real-world conditions, like a blustery winter day in Santa Cruz, prepared him for questions during the interview process.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">&#8220;There's the book work &#8211; making sure you know all of the hard facts,&#8221; Bennett said. &#8220;But getting that experience flying is a whole other thing that can help build confidence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the future, both Bennett and Garfield hope to see CIDER continue to grow and serve more students who might otherwise encounter barriers to entry into drone research and industry.

The honor underscores the university&#8217;s commitment to encouraging positive social impact and is an increase from last year&#8217;s No. 3 spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz students are determined to create real, lasting change,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;The work of our faculty, students and alumni opens minds, informs policy, and helps to create a better, more equitable world. I am so proud of the great work happening on our campus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz pairs high-impact research with 10 tight-knit undergraduate residential colleges that offer students the experience of a small liberal arts college with the depth and rigor of a major research university. The colleges are guided by </span><a href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/themes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">distinct themes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that inform their academic and student life programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our students have a thirst for knowledge and are hungry to create a better world,&#8221; said Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success Akirah J. Bradley-Armstrong. &#8220;They are determined to develop innovative solutions that address the range of issues impacting our local, national, and global communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz provides many opportunities for students to engage in impactful change. Every year, students lead the Practical Activism Conference, which aims to further local and global change by representing diverse perspectives on a variety of social justice issues and providing hands-on tools to make practical change.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coastal Science and Policy Program students are trained to identify critical threats to social and ecological systems, respond to complex problems with effective, practical alternatives, and to confront institutions with innovative, interdisciplinary solutions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students interested in the connections between diversity and sustainability have the opportunity to collaborate with their peers, faculty and staff to advance &#8220;</span><a href="https://pocsc.ucsc.edu/about/inclusive-sustainability.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inclusive Sustainability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; on campus. Their efforts have led to national recognition with Princeton Review ranking UC Santa Cruz the No. 3 green college in the nation in late 2021.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its founding, UC Santa Cruz has been on an unprecedented trajectory, with faculty conducting transformative research and scholarship that serves the world. UC Santa Cruz joined the Association of American Universities (AAU) in 2019 and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities in 2020, remarkable achievements that underscore the impact and quality of the campus&#8217; research as well as graduate and undergraduate teaching. UC Santa Cruz holds the distinction of being one of only two members of the Association of American Universities designated both as an Hispanic Serving Institution and an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution, highlighting its commitment to equitable educational access and research excellence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To identify the best schools for making an impact, Princeton Review surveyed students about community service opportunities at their school, student government, sustainability efforts, and on-campus student engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz was also listed as </span><a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-50-best-value-colleges-public-schools&amp;page=2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. 30 on the list of Best Value Colleges (Public Schools)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ranking of best value colleges is based on a &#8220;return-on-investment&#8221; analysis that factors in a university&#8217;s academic rating, financial aid rating, and cost of attendance. They also took into account PayScale.com&#8217;s percentage of alumni from each school that reported having high job meaning.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3abf6d6d8072704664be42b4265f611c"><name>housing-construction</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Construction well underway on new student housing at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>Committed to advancing student success, UC Santa Cruz leaders are confronting the ongoing housing crisis by providing immediate support programs for students while building new residential buildings to significantly increase the number of students who can live on campus. </summary><start-date>1654498800000</start-date><display-name> </display-name><path>/2022/06/housing-construction</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/housing-construction</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1654548032847</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1654560052462</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/kresge-construction-600px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/kresge-construction-600px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kresge-construction-600px.jpg</name><display-name>kresge-construction-600px.jpg</display-name><file-size>143931</file-size><width>600</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>Aerial photo of construction of new buildings at Kresge College</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/kresge-construction-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/kresge-construction-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kresge-construction-80px.jpg</name><display-name>kresge-construction-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>17980</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Aerial photo of construction of new buildings at Kresge College</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz is in the midst of a renewal project at Kresge College, which includes additional housing and academic space.

There are two major projects already approved&#8212;one under construction and the other overcoming legal challenges in the courts&#8212;that will allow more current students to live on campus. UC Santa Cruz is also in the midst of creating a 10-year housing plan with a project ladder that at all times has projects in the planning, proposal or construction stage. This will allow UCSC to move on to another project if one is delayed and continuously deliver beds to meet its goals.</p>
<p>These bold future plans will build on the campus&#8217;s longstanding commitment to providing an on-campus residential experience for students. The campus currently provides housing for more than half of its undergraduates. While this is one of the highest percentages in the UC system, leaders say it is not high enough. Campus efforts to build more on-campus housing continue in earnest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Santa Cruz faces urgent housing challenges, and on-campus student housing is a critical need for our campus,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;We are compelled to seize every opportunity to increase the amount of student housing we offer.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Building on a founding commitment to housing</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was founded with the goal of providing a residential college experience for students through 10 colleges.</p>
<div class="callout-right narrow">
<h3>Support for students</h3>
<p>In addition to building more student housing, UC Santa Cruz offers a number of resources and programs to help students who are in need of emergency housing, legal consultations, and help finding off-campus housing.</p>
<h3>Slug Support</h3>
<p>No UC Santa Cruz student should be without a safe and reliable place to live. Students who are facing housing insecurity or other challenges are encouraged to call 831-4594446 or email deanofstudents@ucsc.edu. A team of case managers work directly with students to help develop a student-centered plan and resolve the barriers they are facing. Students should email deanofstudents@ucsc.edu for more information about these services.</p>
<h3>Community rentals</h3>
<p>The Community Rentals Office serves as a resource for students, interested in seeking off-campus housing. The office maintains a list of off-campus rental listings and offers a renters workshop that educates students on their rights and responsibilities as a tenant. Upon completion, students receive a certificate to show landlords they are a knowledgeable prospective tenant.</p>
</div>
<p>Over the past two decades, UC Santa Cruz has increased its student housing capacity by 3,300 beds through structural modifications, such as adding floors, major building redesigns and by increasing the density in residence halls. When construction finishes on a new residential building next academic year, the campus will have increased its housing capacity by 53 percent since the 2003&#8211;04 academic year.</p>
<h3>Kresge renewal to add hundreds more beds</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is in the midst of a renewal project at Kresge College, which includes additional housing and academic space. The first phase will be completed next academic year with 400 new beds in a residential building that&#8217;s under construction. Phase 2 of the Kresge project is anticipated to add hundreds more new beds and open in fall 2025.</p>
<p>The UC Board of Regents approved both the Kresge College renewal and the Student Housing West project during its March 2019 meeting. While construction moved ahead at Kresge, Student Housing West has faced legal challenges that have gone against the needs and interests of students&#8212;building much-needed housing.</p>
<h3>Student Housing West to create about 3,000 new beds</h3>
<p>Student Housing West will enable UC Santa Cruz to offer much more housing to its current graduate students and upper-division undergraduates by building new housing units with space for around 3,000 students. The project, spread across two sites, will also allow the campus to expand child-care services to serve the children of faculty, staff, and students.</p>
<p>Student Housing West has been delayed by lawsuits, and the housing crisis has only grown more severe over the past four years. Had construction started as planned, Student Housing West would have been well underway to providing more much-needed housing.</p>
<p>The courts have continued to rule in favor of the university and in some instances opponents have agreed to dismiss their case. There is no question that the project is needed, and that the university is not only lawfully permitted to build housing on the sites identified in the project but has done so with sound analysis of the environmental impacts.</p>
<h2>A long-term focus on housing</h2>
<p>In fall 2021, the UC Board of Regents unanimously approved UCSC&#8217;s 2021 Long Range Development, which is a blueprint for future physical development on campus, painting in broad strokes how the main campus and Westside Research Park might develop over the next two decades. The plan identifies where students, staff and faculty could be housed, where new spaces for learning and research could be created, and what land should be off-limits to construction.</p>
<p>The plan respects the original vision for UC Santa Cruz and was shaped by substantial feedback from community partners. Highlights of the plan include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilizing a compact footprint for learning, research and housing spaces.</li>
<li>Proposing sites for up to four new residential colleges, advancing our distinctive residential college-system structure.</li>
<li>Expands housing for 100 percent of new full-time student enrollment above 19,500. UCSC is currently at about 18,500 students.</li>
<li>Providing housing for up to 25 percent of new employees, based on demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like for many organizations in Santa Cruz County, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer said the lack of housing availability and its cost makes it difficult to recruit and retain employees and that the campus must mitigate its impacts in order to achieve its long-term goals.</p>
<p>With insights and recommendations from an Employee Housing Advisory Workgroup, the campus is developing a plan that will help to provide more housing and housing support for faculty and staff including a staged plan to regularly develop, plan, design and build more employee housing.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz anticipates holding its enrollment steady as possible until more housing comes online. Housing is a critical component of student success, and UC Santa Cruz remains focused on ensuring students are poised to have a meaningful college experience that will position them for long-term personal and professional success.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3af637738072704664be42b4762bf17f"><name>distinguished-teaching-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Associate Professor Nick Mitchell receives 2021-22 Distinguished Teaching Award</title><summary>Nick Mitchell was honored for his positive impact on students and the leading role he has played in creating new programs that foster the intellectual development of students and UC Santa Cruz</summary><start-date>1654498800000</start-date><display-name>Distinguished Teaching Award</display-name><path>/2022/06/distinguished-teaching-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/distinguished-teaching-award</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1654551623519</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1654551623519</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Feminist Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Sandra Messick</name><title></title><phone/><email>sgmessic@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/nick-mitchell-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/nick-mitchell-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nick-mitchell-500px.jpg</name><display-name>nick-mitchell-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>126800</file-size><width>500</width><height>500</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/nick-mitchell-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/nick-mitchell-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nick-mitchell-80px.jpg</name><display-name>nick-mitchell-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>9284</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Nick Mitchell, an associate professor in the Critical Race and Ethnic Studies and Feminist Studies Departments, has been awarded the 2021-22 Distinguished Teaching Award. He was honored for his positive impact on students and the leading role he has played in creating new programs that foster the intellectual development of students and UC Santa Cruz. One of those was the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/02/black-studies-minor-feature-story.html">creation of the Black Studies minor</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>The Distinguished Teaching Award honors outstanding teaching on campus. It is open to all faculty, teaching professors, and Unit 18 lecturers. Faculty peers make nominations, and candidates are considered based on their contributions to a culture of teaching, research-based pedagogy, and contributions to educational equity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the Academic Senate&#8217;s Committee on Teaching has presented annual Excellence in Teaching Awards for many years, it was only in 2018-19 that we began presenting this Distinguished Teaching Award as a way to recognize instructors who have made lasting contributions to a culture of teaching and to educational equity within and beyond UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Academic Senate Chair David Brundage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nominated by both the Critical Race and Ethnic Studies and Feminist Studies departments, Nick Mitchell is an exemplary teacher who has succeeded in creating space for diverse students, <br/>both undergraduate and graduate, to thrive at UC Santa Cruz. We are honored to have Professor Mitchell as a colleague.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mitchell is a UCSC alumnus receiving a Ph.D. in history of consciousness with an emphasis in feminist studies. He was a founding coordinator of the Black Cultural Studies Research Cluster and the Critical Race and Ethnic Studies Graduate Collective.</p>
<p>He was a faculty member in the Ethnic Studies Department at UC Riverside before joining the UCSC faculty in 2015. Professor Mitchell&#8217;s research and teaching examine the social arrangements of knowledge and how knowledge and its institutional practices impact social worlds.</p>
<p>He is the fourth recipient of the Distinguished Teaching Award. Mitchell has also been awarded the Woodrow Wilson Career Enhancement Fellowship for Junior Faculty, 2016-2017, and the UC President&#8217;s Postdoctoral Fellowship, 2011-2013.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3e9730ee8072704664be42b44bd32cb9"><name>worker-safety-webinar</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Free webinar on worker safety best practices</title><start-date>1654585200000</start-date><path>/2022/06/worker-safety-webinar</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/worker-safety-webinar</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1654612504782</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1654612504782</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>June is National Safety Month!

It is also the first initiative focused specifically on the Arts and Humanities to be selected since the 2019 launch of UC-HSI DDI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For decades, there has been robust funding on the state and national levels for these sorts of graduate and academic career pipelines within the STEM disciplines,&#8221; says UCSC Dean of the Division of Arts Dr. Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu who serves as Principal Investigator for the program. &#8220;The Arts and Humanities share similar achievement, retention, and graduation gaps, but have not had the same resources to support our students. This is an exceptional investment to advance educational equity in our divisions and a powerful tool for enduring institutional change.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Along with our partner in the Arts, the Humanities Division is committed to recruiting and retaining a more diverse faculty,&#8221; says Dr. Jasmine Alinder, Dean of the Humanities. &#8220;This </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pathways</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative supports that work by helping us build more diverse graduate student cohorts."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pathways</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program is a multifaceted initiative designed to provide students from UCSC and its regional partner HSI, CSU Monterey Bay, with faculty mentorship, summer research experiences, and professional development workshops at key points leading up to and during their graduate careers, practices that have been shown to have a positive impact on student performance and retention, particularly for underrepresented students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research indicates that these students face distinct academic, financial, and social barriers that prevent them from attaining an MFA/Ph.D. and moving on to the professoriate. National diversity data bear that out. An astonishing 82.8% of Humanities faculty are white, and a Strategic National Arts Alumni Project survey of career outcomes for UC arts alumni found that 91.2% of those who persisted in arts related professions, including the professoriate, were white.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a hidden curriculum about navigating higher education that a student who is first generation, for example, may not be privy to, so there&#8217;s a real need to pull back that curtain and to provide students with the mentoring relationships, professional resources, and experiences and opportunities they need to really understand the academic landscape and thrive in it,&#8221; says Dr. Holly Unruh, Executive Director of the Arts Research Institute at UCSC. &#8220;Essential to this is an academic culture of inclusion and equity that supports students&#8217; sense of belonging in addition to their academic success. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pathways</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> makes this a priority, and its leadership team, including the deans of both the Arts and Humanities Division, is distinguished for leading divisional equity and diversity initiatives.&#8221; &#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the division deans, the leadership team includes faculty members from each who have been active in supporting underrepresented students as well as in campus efforts to examine climate and support for underrepresented faculty, and the faculty and staff directors of The Humanities Institute and the Arts Research Institute, who will lead and house all program activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Humanities Institute is thrilled to be partnering with our colleagues in the Arts on this important initiative,&#8221; says Irena Polic, Managing Director of The Humanities Institute. &#8220;One of our primary goals over the last decade has been to think deeply about graduate education in the Humanities and preparing our students for a wide range of careers. Our </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/graduate-student-success-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graduate Student Success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, originally funded by a </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/projects/expanding-humanities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Mellon Foundation, has been transformative for the students in our division, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pathways </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be able to expand on that work and connect the existing programs across campus to maximize their impact across our divisions.

T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he Queen&#8217;s Honours List noted that Julien had received his knighthood for services to diversity and inclusion in art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julien, who had previously received </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the title Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2017</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is a critically acclaimed British filmmaker and installation artist. His multi-screen film installations have been widely presented in major museums and galleries around the world including TATE, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, MAXXI Museum in Rome, and many others. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julien&#8217;s work has been exhibited in the world&#8217;s most prestigious contemporary art exhibitions including the Venice Biennale, Performa, documenta, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julien&#8217;s art practice breaks down the barriers between different artistic disciplines, drawing from and commenting on film, dance, photography, music, theatre, painting, and sculpture, uniting them to give voice to the experiences of disregarded, often black, and queer narratives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His 1989 drama-documentary </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking for Langston</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a poetic exploration of Langston Hughes and the Harlem Renaissance, first garnered Julien widespread international attention, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">while his 1991 debut feature </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young Soul Rebels</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won the Semaine de la Critique prize at the Cannes Film Festival.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Recent works have included the 2019 ten-screen installation </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lessons of the Hour</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a meditation on the life and times of Frederick Douglass, that just recently entered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julien is one of just a handful of black British artists to be knighted. Filmmaker Steve McQueen and painter Frank Bowling have both received the award in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the knighthood at this particular time is a great honour, and I hope it shines a light on the importance of questions of diversity and inclusion for the arts,&#8221; says Julien. &#8220;The visual arts have led the way around these questions, and my work as a professor and educator at Santa Cruz is a central aspect of my practice. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is, therefore, essential that the arts maintain their pivotal role at universities globally in light of the current impediments they are facing. We can only hope that those who want to lead change in education will recognise the importance of the arts in this crucial moment of social transformation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julien, together with independent curator and writer Mark Nash, the former head of contemporary art at the Royal College of Art in London, established </span><a href="https://danm.ucsc.edu/project_group/isaac-julien-lab"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Isaac Julien Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at UCSC when they formally joined the faculty in 2019. Students draw upon moving and still images to create visual and sonic languages for production, exhibition, and installation and have the opportunity to assist Julien with project research and production in both California and London, where the artist has a studio. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of Julien&#8217;s projects have been developed out of the Lab at UCSC, including his latest, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Again&#8230;(Statues Never Die)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, opening this month at the Barnes in Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our Lab, dedicated to excellence in creating and curating the moving image, has fantastic students from across campus disciplines and from around the world. They are doing significant projects that need wider support and recognition!&#8221; says Julien. &#8220;Starting in 1994, when my partner Mark Nash and I were first invited to teach courses in the History of Consciousness Department by luminaries like Teresa de Lauretis, I have always seen UC Santa Cruz as a special and unique research and teaching institution. We met people here who we had long admired, such as Angela Davis who inspired my 1986 film </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Passion of Remembrance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, James Clifford, artist Victor Burgin, Donna Haraway. Today we have excellent contemporaries as well, terrific artists and scholars, and the Arts Division&#8217;s Dean Celine </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parre&#241;as Shimizu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who has proudly championed diversity and inclusion. All have had a lasting impact o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n our Lab, as well as contributing to my work as an artist and filmmaker and to my teaching.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Distinguished Professor Sir Isaac Julien&#8217;s work inspires us to achieve the consciousness that the arts singularly enable,&#8221; says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parre&#241;as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shimizu. "At UCSC, he demonstrates immense generosity to his students, sharing the global regard for his work to launch the next generation of scholars and artists. We celebrate the generosity of our dear colleague exemplified in this great honor."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3fad6e108072704664be42b4a24279a7"><name>keynote-flexible-work</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Moving forward with flexible work arrangements</title><summary>With insights gained over the past year and additional feedback from campus leaders, we have developed a vision and guiding principles for flexible work arrangements to help our campus move into this new blended work environment. </summary><start-date>1654585200000</start-date><display-name>Moving forward with flexible work arrangements</display-name><path>/2022/06/keynote-flexible-work</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/keynote-flexible-work</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1654630739449</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1654631509178</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/sammy-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/sammy-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sammy-500px.jpg</name><display-name>sammy-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>76457</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>hands of sammy the slug on a computer</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>This academic year, we largely resumed in-person instruction and many other activities. It has been wonderful to see students studying together in the library, faculty leading classroom discussions, and staff members working to support the mission of our university.</p>
<p>A substantial amount of our work, however, has continued in the virtual environment. The rapid switch to remote work in March 2020 required us to rethink how we accomplish our work. Early on, it became clear it would be a moment of profound change for many organizations, including those in higher education like UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, campus leaders have developed a framework that will continue to allow for flexibility for some employees. Allowing for remote and hybrid work arrangements can offer benefits that are both in the interest of staff members and the university. While some roles require staff members to be on campus to perform their duties, other jobs can be done with employees working in a hybrid or fully remote environment.</p>
<p>With insights gained over the past year and additional feedback from campus leaders, we have developed a vision and guiding principles for flexible work arrangements to help our campus move into this new blended work environment. Our focus is on making sure staff are able to effectively serve and support the campus and less about where that work is accomplished.</p>
<p>Our vision is to offer a flexible work environment that advances UCSC&#8217;s mission and strategic campus goals by attracting and retaining a diverse, talented workforce and optimizing their engagement and contributions.<br/><br/>We adopted eight guiding principles to help guide the development of flexible work arrangements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Campus Mission and Strategic Goals:</strong> Ensure effective support of the campus mission and advancing strategic campus goals.</li>
<li><strong>Operational and Business Needs:</strong> Prioritize operational and business needs, ensuring department goals, objectives, and requirements are being met, and safeguard opportunities to make adjustments to remain consistent with them.</li>
<li><strong>Equity:</strong> Uphold equity, consistency, and accessibility in all aspects of flexible work arrangements and related resources. Make decisions based on objective business considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity and Inclusion:</strong> Foster a diverse and inclusive culture that enables us to be agile, attract and retain high-quality talent, and further our position as a reputable employer and highly desired workplace.</li>
<li><strong>Resources:</strong> Ensure employees and supervisors/managers know about and can access resources related to health, safety and well-being and know how to escalate concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Space Optimization:</strong> Seek ways to optimize space utilization on campus property, including creating shared workspaces and repurposing/returning underutilized space.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Enable flexibility through university-wide technology, communication tools and business processes that allow for organizational alignment, efficiency, and safety.</li>
<li><strong>Check and Adjust:</strong> Regularly check and adjust; adapt to changing conditions and make improvements to move toward our strategic campus goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The decision about whether a hybrid or remote work arrangement works for your role rests with your manager or supervisor. If you want to talk to your manager or supervisor about whether a hybrid or remote work arrangement is possible, start with the Staff Human Resources <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VAQS0O4VrnS6N3rkVRbDezKITWhKTXPe/view">self-assessment tool</a> for employees interested in understanding whether a flexible work arrangement might be compatible.</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz is an incredible university and the strength of our campus is based on the talented staff, faculty, and students who are drawn to our mission of serving students and producing world-class research and creative scholarship.</p>
<p>We believe that continued flexibility will strengthen our ability to recruit and retain diverse and talented employees and, in turn, accelerate our campus&#8217;s unprecedented trajectory.</p>
<p>If you have questions about flexible work arrangements you should begin by talking with your manager or supervisor.<br/><br/>Sincerely,&#160;</p>

Associate Professor of Biomolecular Engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering Rebecca DuBois has set out to address this pressing need. To fund her innovative approach to the development of an RSV vaccine, DuBois has been awarded the prestigious and highly competitive National Institutes of Health Research Project Grant (RO1).&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">RSV causes contagious cold-like symptoms that can develop into serious lung problems and lead to hospitalizations, especially in young children and older populations &#8211; each year, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03704-y"><span class="s2">3 million children under five years old are hospitalized from RSV and 64 million total people</span></a> are affected worldwide.The five-year, $3.8 million grant will be shared with DuBois&#8217;s collaborator Ralph Tripp at the University of Georgia and will build on both researchers' years of work studying RSV. Their overall aim is to validate their RSV vaccine in pre-clinical trials.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;There&#8217;s a huge need &#8211; this is a really important gap in our vaccine schedule to protect children,&#8221; said DuBois, whose experience with her child&#8217;s severe RSV fueled her to take on this research. &#8220;I think the NIH study section reviewers liked that it's a totally different strategy than what everyone else is taking.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DuBois&#8217;s lab focuses on bioengineering the commonly overlooked RSV G protein, used by the virus to attach to host cells, to expose its vulnerable points so the host&#8217;s body can fight back.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/03/rsv-antibodies.html">In previous work</a></span><span class="s1">, they have found that a region, called the central conserved domain and just 40 amino acids long, can be engineered to evoke an protective immunogenic response from the host. Additionally, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/rsv-protein-vaccine.html"><span class="s2">a recent paper</span></a> from the DuBois lab determined that this altered protein is still recognized by the body&#8217;s immune system and therefore could be effective in a vaccine.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I think since RSV has been such a difficult virus to create a vaccine for, we're innovative in that we are using structural biology to learn more about this protein and make changes to it using protein engineering to improve its immunogenicity,&#8221; said Maria Juarez, a third-year Ph.D. student in the DuBois lab. &#8220;That&#8217;s something that our lab has really spearheaded.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Targeting this specific region of the G protein, which remains unchanged as the virus mutates, is a cutting-edge technique in vaccine development that may allow a vaccine to continue its effectiveness as the virus mutates.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;By whittling down our vaccine to this important and conserved part, and designing it so [the antigen] is exposed to our immune system in a better way, we can refocus the antibody response &#8211; it won&#8217;t get distracted by all the parts that aren&#8217;t conserved,&#8221; DuBois said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a more strategic way to do vaccine design, instead of just targeting the whole protein and choosing one strain to target.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Juarez and the others in the DuBois lab will continue to experiment with ways to ensure that the surface of their engineered protein is structured in a way to provoke the strongest immune response. Juarez also noted that the techniques she is using to engineer the protein are cheaper and less time intensive than other methods, making future production of the vaccine scalable so it can eventually be used commercially around the world.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once DuBois&#8217;s group has developed their vaccine, they will send it to Tripp&#8217;s lab to test if it creates a strong antibody response in pre-clinical models. The group expects the first vaccines to be tested in pre-clinical models by the end of 2022.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This project differs from other RSV vaccine efforts, some of which are in phase III clinical trials, in the method it uses to evoke a protective immune response. <a href="https://www.path.org/resources/rsv-vaccine-and-mab-snapshot/"><span class="s2">The large majority</span></a> of other researchers focus on the RSV F protein, which fuses the virus and host cell membranes together to get the virus&#8217;s genetic information into cells.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eventually, the researchers anticipate that their vaccine could be combined with one that uses the F protein in order to create an even more robust immune response.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20 universities in the alliance represent every university that has been both categorized as R1&#8212;very high research activity&#8212;by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education and designated as Hispanic Serving Institution by the U.S. Department of Education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HSRU Alliance aims to achieve two key goals by 2030: double the number of Hispanic doctoral students enrolled at Alliance universities, and&#160;increase by 20 percent the Hispanic professoriate in Alliance universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are thrilled to join our partners in this collaborative effort to enhance opportunities for underserved and minority students,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;Since obtaining HSI status in 2012, UC Santa Cruz faculty and staff have worked intentionally to enhance student success. I&#8217;m proud that our campus has shown true leadership in this arena and is committed to effecting real change.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new concerted nationwide effort to increase educational opportunity underscores the efforts already underway at UC Santa Cruz to increase faculty diversity and support the success of Latinx, low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students, and to prepare them for rewarding careers once they graduate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of only two institutions in the nation that holds the honor of being a Hispanic Serving Institution, an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution and member of the Association of American Universities, UC Santa Cruz is committed to creating educational equity that will help lead to real, transformative change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumnus Jacob Martinez, a leading voice in technology access and education who serves as an external adviser to UC Santa Cruz, said he expects the unified efforts of the universities will increase educational equity across the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC is poised to be the leader in building Latino leadership throughout California and beyond,&#8221; Martinez said. &#8220;By making a commitment to double the number of Latino doctorate students the alliance will have a positive impact on Latinos and non-Latinos communities for generations to come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martinez (Oakes &#8217;04, evolutionary biology) founded Digital NEST in 2014. The nonprofit, in Watsonville, Salinas, and Gilroy, is a technology workforce development hub providing youth in rural communities with high-demand technology skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="" height="115" src="images/hsru-graphic-450px.jpg" style="float: left; border-width: 1px; margin: 5px;" width="350"/>UC Santa Cruz leaders are focused on creating lasting change across campus that will serve current and future students. Top campus leaders have continued to work closely with the Division of Student Affairs and Success and its Hispanic-Serving Institution Initiatives team.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2015, UCSC has received $16.6 million through eight federal Hispanic Serving Institution grants </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/hsi-programs.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to support institutional transformation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s efforts are focused on increasing its </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">servingness </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a Hispanic Serving University while also working to advance the student experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In collaboration with scores of faculty and staff across campus, the Hispanic Serving Institution Initiatives team has launched and continued a range of programs and services to support undergraduate and graduate students in their academic success. A $3 million grant awarded in fall 2020 is focused on supporting graduate student success, which allows UC Santa Cruz to address inclusion through the full educational pipeline.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To advance its research impact, diversify its faculty, and provide greater access to research and learning opportunities for its students, UC Santa Cruz announced earlier this year that the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/02/faculty-expansion.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campus will be hiring 100 additional faculty over the next decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the most significant faculty hiring efforts the campus has pursued since its founding more than 50 years ago.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HSRU alliance universities are engaged in thousands of research projects in the arts and humanities, STEM, health sciences, social sciences and other fields with world-changing outcomes. In 2019-20, Alliance universities produced 11,027 doctoral graduates, of which 13 percent were Hispanic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the formal announcement of the HRSU Alliance, the universities began working together on several initiatives. The first project, funded by a $5 million grant from the Mellon Foundation, will conduct cross-regional research and train doctoral students in Latinx humanities. A second initiative, funded by the National Science Foundation, expands opportunities for Hispanic students in computer science.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20 universities represent every university that has been both categorized as R1 (very high research activity) by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education and designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution by the U.S. Department of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representing nine states, the 20 HSRU Alliance universities together enrolled 766,718 students in the Fall of 2020; of those, 33 percent were Hispanic. In 2020, the combined research spending of these universities totaled more than $5.9 billion.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="457d0b988072704664be42b4b5f036fd"><name>coastal-communities-of-color-report</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Graduate student’s research helps environmental organizations better serve coastal communities of color</title><summary>Coastal Science and Policy Program graduate student Kalina Browne led development of a new research report on behalf of Green 2.0, a national watchdog organization focused on diversity and equity in the environmental sector.  </summary><start-date>1654671600000</start-date><path>/2022/06/coastal-communities-of-color-report</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/coastal-communities-of-color-report</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1654728231800</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1654728454127</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/browne-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/browne-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>browne-300.jpg</name><display-name>browne-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>54327</file-size><width>300</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Kalina Browne beside the ocean</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/browne-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/browne-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>browne-80.jpg</name><display-name>browne-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>20394</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Kalina Browne beside the ocean</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Coastal Science and Policy Program graduate student Kalina Browne.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coastal Science and Policy Program graduate student Kalina Browne led development of a </span><a href="https://diversegreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Coastal-Considerations-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, released on World Ocean's Day, that can help guide environmental organizations toward better engagement with coastal communities of color. Browne received a paid fellowship to work on the project on behalf of </span><a href="https://diversegreen.org/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green 2.0</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a national watchdog organization focused on diversity and equity in the environmental sector.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coastal communities of color are among those on the front lines of climate change, facing environmental, social, and health hazards, often with limited resources, as a result of historical exclusion and marginalization. Environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) could potentially provide important support for these communities, but little research has focused specifically on these relationships. So Browne was brought in to develop a report on the topic with actionable recommendations for NGOs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Browne&#8217;s work with Green 2.0 was part of a summer placement through the Master of Science in Coastal Science and Policy (CSP) degree program at UC Santa Cruz. All CSP master&#8217;s students spend a summer working alongside an organization within their field of study as part of the program&#8217;s focus on real-world experiential learning. And Browne said her summer placement project with Green 2.0 felt like a great fit from the start.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am from Saint Vincent and The Grenadines, which is a coastal nation in itself, and this project was all about coastal communities of color, so I&#8217;ve always been interested in that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wanted to get a perspective on these issues from the U.S. standpoint.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of her work on the new report, Browne conducted a literature review, interviewed 17 personnel at local, regional, and national NGOs, and reviewed the work and strategies of 25 organizations operating primarily within coastal communities of color in California, Florida, and Louisiana.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Findings from the report detail how coastal communities of color across the U.S. experience environmental harms, including industrial pollution and climate change impacts like sea level rise, flooding, and hurricanes. Some communities are also threatened by climate gentrification, which is displacing residents in higher-elevation coastal areas. And declining marine biodiversity places a strain on livelihoods and culturally important food resources.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also shares how NGOs can support these communities, including through help with lobbying, funding, and organizing and through specialized services like legal aid, scientific research, and disaster relief. Training and education offerings can also help community leaders and local organizations to build their capacity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the report also describes best-practices that NGOs must follow in order to engage equitably with the communities they intend to serve. Many communities have past experience with extractive policies or unmet promises from NGOs, so these organizations will need to earn trust. One way that the report recommends doing this is by listening to the community and making a long-term commitment to relationship building, practices which Browne says many environmental organizations still overlook.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Often, communities are included only when the planning and design for a project is already done, and they're asked to comment on it, but inclusion should really happen at the very beginning, and then continue throughout the entire process,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to start with listening to the community&#8217;s needs, rather than going in with preconceived notions, like your own idea of a project that you want to do or that you think a community should be interested in.&#8221;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a true partnership with a community requires co-creation of projects, which should include appropriate compensation for community members, the report says. NGOs should also educate themselves about the historical and local context in coastal communities of color and can leverage their organization&#8217;s resources toward empowering youth and engaging community members in accessible ways. At the same time, they should be conducting work to address internal diversity, equity, inclusion and justice issues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report contains examples, from organizations of varying sizes, about what they&#8217;ve learned from working with coastal communities of color, and Browne hopes environmental NGOs across the country may use the report&#8217;s findings to guide their own efforts to engage more equitably with communities. Browne also took her own personal lessons away from the experience of producing the report.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve found that I really like working with organizations that have values aligned with mine, and where I can work with other people of color and feel a sense of belonging,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking to work with organizations that lead with justice and equity, instead of it being an add-on, and I want to continue centering people in my work, especially frontline communities.&#8221;</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="499ef2e88072704664be42b49dc6c73d"><name>chancellor-alliance-hsru</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC joins new alliance aimed at boosting Latinx doctoral students, professors</title><summary>The group, officially launching today and comprising all 20 of the nation’s top research universities that are also classified as Hispanic-Serving Institutions, aims to increase opportunity for those historically underserved by higher education. </summary><start-date>1654758000000</start-date><display-name>Alliance of Hispanic Serving Research Universities</display-name><path>/2022/06/chancellor-alliance-hsru</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/chancellor-alliance-hsru</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1654797562580</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1654797689075</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/hsru-graphic-450px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/hsru-graphic-450px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hsru-graphic-450px.jpg</name><display-name>hsru-graphic-450px.jpg</display-name><file-size>29521</file-size><width>450</width><height>148</height></image><image-alt>HSRU Logo</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear Campus Community,</p>
<p>I am thrilled to announce that UC Santa Cruz is one of the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/alliance-hispanic-serving-research-universities.html">founding members of the Alliance of Hispanic Serving Research Universities</a>. The group, officially launching today and comprising all 20 of the nation&#8217;s top research universities that are also classified as Hispanic-Serving Institutions, aims to increase opportunity for those historically underserved by higher education. Our collective goals are to double the number of Hispanic doctoral students enrolled at alliance universities by 2030, and to increase the number of Hispanic professors at the institutions by 20 percent.</p>
<p>This is an important effort, and I&#8217;m proud that our campus has committed to effecting real change in this area. Hispanics and Latinos are the largest minority group in the United States, yet they continue to be underrepresented in higher education. We have roughly 19,000 undergraduate and graduate students on our campus, with a quarter identifying as Hispanic or Latinx. We strive to be a student-centered university focused on advancing the success of our undergraduate and graduate students. Our campus holds the distinction of being one of only two members of the prestigious Association of American Universities designated both as an Hispanic-Serving Institution and an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution, highlighting our commitment to equitable educational access and research excellence. By joining with other universities, though, there is more that we can accomplish.</p>
<p>As R1 universities &#8212; designations given to universities with very high research activity &#8212; alliance members are well-positioned to train the next generation of Hispanic and Latinx scholars, who as a group are underrepresented in graduate programs. We can increase the number of Hispanic doctoral students with speed and at scale. In 2020, alliance universities produced 6,090 doctoral graduates, 9 percent of whom were Hispanic or Latinx. This is better than the national average, but it isn&#8217;t good enough. Because we educate so many of America&#8217;s undergraduates, we can broaden the pathway to graduate school and inspire more highly qualified students to continue their education to a higher level.</p>
<p>The universities we are joining in this push are research powerhouses like UC Santa Cruz, with a combined enrollment of more than 750,000 students. I believe deeply that we can make a real difference, improving Latinx representation in the upper reaches of higher education. That promises to improve the trajectories of thousands of individuals, families, and communities, and will undoubtedly result in more world-changing research outcomes. Over and over again, we have seen that a wider range of voices, viewpoints, and experiences leads to more discoveries and breakthroughs.</p>
<p>We have the ability, and the responsibility, to change the face of higher education, and I am excited that our campus will be a key player in this effort.</p>

Their 2022 season came full circle, winning against the Santa Clara University team&#8212;who had defeated the Banana Slugs in their first game&#8212;in the first round of playoffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting on the team&#8217;s season, UCSC Women&#8217;s Rugby Football Club President Diana Ochoa </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Oakes &#8217;23, Environmental Science)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said the 30-member team worked tirelessly to achieve their competitively successful season following a year and a half of remote learning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We really came a long way, and getting to see the team win second place and go to playoffs was such a cool experience,&#8221; Ochoa said. &#8220;It was great to give that success to the coaches, too, because they worked so hard for it for multiple years. It was just such an amazing season, and we&#8217;re so much more excited for next year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ochoa is in her second year at UCSC and plans to graduate in 2023 with a bachelor&#8217;s in environmental science. She was one of two members to join the club during the 2020&#8211;2021 academic year and now serves as the club&#8217;s president. In her role, Ochoa frequently communicates with the UCSC Athletics and Recreation Department and prepares the team for game days.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, Ochoa tore her ACL, and she hasn&#8217;t been able to take to the field this year, but she is grateful to serve as the club&#8217;s president off the field. She said the rugby team at UC Santa Cruz is her family.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since the second I walked into my first practice, I knew those girls were my family,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The coaches have really helped facilitate the feeling that we&#8217;re all a family, and we&#8217;re here to help each other. We&#8217;re here to play rugby first and foremost, but also finding that community through rugby has been amazing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sentiments similar to Ochoa&#8217;s are shared across generations of rugby alumni of UCSC. The UCSC rugby alumni are known as the Black and Gold Society&#8212;representative of the color of the players&#8217; uniforms&#8212;and they actively support both the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s rugby clubs at UCSC. The alumni contribute to a rich, 55-year history of rugby at UCSC, and players often remain close friends for years after their graduation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deborah Newburn </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Cowell &#8217;81, Environmental Studies and American Studies)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was part of the original Women&#8217;s Rugby Football Club at UCSC and is joining a trip to the Grand Canyon this summer with a handful of her former teammates. She said they often plan trips together and occasionally take day hikes and cook breakfast and dinner together.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s interesting is that these folks weren&#8217;t in my major, and yet they are the friends who are left over from my UC Santa Cruz days,&#8221; Newburn said. &#8220;Those are the only people from my university days who I see&#8212;not my college roommates, not my dorm mates, and not my colleagues from my major.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women&#8217;s rugby was in its infancy in the early &#8217;70s, and by 1979, teams had begun to pop up in the Bay Area, including at UC Berkeley and Stanford, as well as San Jose and San Francisco community teams.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC&#8217;s Women&#8217;s Rugby Football Club got its start in 1979 with roughly six members, hand-me-down jerseys from the men&#8217;s team, and little financial support. Men&#8217;s coach Dan Porter oscillated between the two groups, and often the women were left without a coach. Regardless, the women on the team did everything they could to make their season happen. They fundraised for food and transportation and used their own cars for away games.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First-ever UCSC Women&#8217;s Rugby Football Club Captain Martha Brown </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Kresge &#8217;81, Biology and Sociology) </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">said the men&#8217;s team gave the women&#8217;s team enormous support when they were first starting.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t like we were starting from absolute scratch,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There was a long history of rugby at the university at that point, since the men&#8217;s team had been going for 12 years or so. So we were building on something they&#8217;d already created, but taking it in a different direction.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The women&#8217;s team didn&#8217;t win a single game their first year, but by the second year, the women&#8217;s rugby club was fielding a full team of 15 players, and by its third year, they even had some extra players. UCSC&#8217;s women&#8217;s rugby club was swiftly increasing their standing in their league and had immeasurable amounts of fun while doing so. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We all still stay in touch and hang out and do trips together, and it really speaks to what a powerful activity rugby was for us,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;It&#8217;s sort of a bonding experience when you get out there and rely on each other to make it happen instead of relying on a coach or an administrator or the backing of the university. It made those bonds even stronger.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>UCSC powerhouse: Women&#8217;s rugby 2006&#8211;2013&#160;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The years 2006&#8211;2013 were the most competitively successful seasons so far in the history of women&#8217;s rugby at UCSC. From winning the national title in 2006, to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">taking silver in the country at the Division II Women&#8217;s Rugby National Championship in 2007,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to making it to the final four in 2010, and the elite eight in 2013, women&#8217;s rugby quickly became a powerhouse and one of the most competitively successful sports at UC Santa Cruz. But the teams that were finding newfound success didn&#8217;t lose the camaraderie and inclusivity that was tightly woven into the history of the sport at UCSC. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Winning wasn&#8217;t everything for us, but we had high expectations of ourselves,&#8221; said 2006 UCSC Women&#8217;s Rugby Football Club Captain Michelle Sit </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Oakes &#8217;08, Feminist Studies)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;I think as players, we had a lot of trust in each other.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We found community and really found a sense of identity for ourselves,&#8221; Sit added. &#8220;Speaking for myself, I found a core sense of identity, identifying as a queer person and having support and camaraderie from my peers. It&#8217;s just an inclusive and accepting place; it&#8217;s very much a space where you could be yourself and find a sense of belonging.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the first women&#8217;s team in 1979, Sit said the 2006 team found themselves bonded not only through the rigor of participating in a tackle sport, but through doing everything in their power to make the season happen. The team frequently fundraised to participate in games across the country and state, and sold calendars to make it to their national championship game.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2006 women&#8217;s team was the first to win the DII Collegiate 15&#8217;s National Championship for the UCSC Rugby Football Club.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the 2006 national winning season wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without the team&#8217;s humble origins, Sit said. In 2004&#8212;Sit&#8217;s first year&#8212;the group found themselves without a coach. Instead, they were taught by their captains, using shoes as cones and a water bottle as a ball. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We had to build from the ground up, and I think there&#8217;s something to be said for that,&#8221; Sit said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2022 women&#8217;s rugby team found themselves in a rebuilding year that parallels UCSC rugby history. With the support of their coaches, trust in one another, and a hoard of dedicated alumni, the 2022 team put in the work to secure their second-place title.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is such an amazing team,&#8221; said 2022 rugby president Diana Ochoa. &#8220;I want to emphasize how hard it really is on your body to play rugby, and the fact that these 30 girls come out to play means the world to me.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4ec412018072704664be42b4670392a0"><name>whistleblower-notice</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Annual message about the California Whistleblower Protection Act</title><summary>The California Government Code requires every state agency, including the University of California, to annually distribute to its employees a message from the California State Auditor that provides an explanation of the California Whistleblower Protection Act.</summary><start-date>1654844400000</start-date><display-name>Annual message about the California Whistleblower Protection Act</display-name><path>/2022/06/whistleblower-notice</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/whistleblower-notice</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1654883881425</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1654883881425</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/whistleblower.png</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/whistleblower.png</link><site>news</site><name>whistleblower.png</name><display-name>whistleblower.png</display-name><file-size>751105</file-size><width>800</width><height>1676</height></image><image-alt>Whistleblower brochure</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 brochure is <a href="images/whistleblower_brochure.pdf">available online</a>.&#160;</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California is committed to maintaining the highest standards of conduct in the fulfillment of its education, research, public service and patient care mission.

A multinational research team has now shown how elephant seals use their sensitive whiskers to detect motion in the water and track down prey.</p>
<p>To conduct the study, published June 13 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, researchers at UC Santa Cruz and the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) in Japan deployed miniature video cameras attached to the cheeks of female elephant seals, along with other innovative technologies for tracking the seals&#8217; behavior in the wild.</p>
<p>Other researchers have used experimental studies of seals in controlled settings to show, for example, that blindfolded harbor seals can use their whiskers to detect slight motions in the water and follow the hydrodynamic trails behind moving objects. Until now, however, there was no record of how seals actually use their whiskers in their natural environment.</p>
<p>The new study showed that elephant seals perform rhythmic whisker movements&#8212;protracting and retracting their whiskers&#8212;when they are searching for prey at depth. At the surface and at the start of dives, the seals kept their whiskers in a relaxed position, but once they reached depths where they typically forage for small fish and squid, they extended their whiskers and began the whisking motion, which is similar to the way rodents and other terrestrial mammals use whiskers to explore their environments.</p>
<p>Some of the prey in the deep ocean are bioluminescent, and elephant seals have eyes that are sensitive to dim light at the wavelengths of bioluminescence. But the researchers detected bioluminescence in only 20% of the feeding events recorded in the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that even when they eat bioluminescent prey, they also use their whiskers to chase it, so we conclude that whisker sensing is the primary sensory hunting strategy of elephant seals,&#8221; said first author Taiki Adachi, a researcher at NIPR and currently a project scientist in the Beltran Lab at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other species that feed at these depths, like beaked whales, use active biosonar to locate prey. This is the elephant seal solution to foraging in darkness, since they don&#8217;t have biosonar,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz researcher and coauthor Patrick Robinson.</p>
<p>Robinson manages the A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve where UCSC scientists have been studying elephant seals since the 1960s. Part of the UC Natural Reserve System, A&#241;o Nuevo is the site of a large elephant seal breeding colony. Elephant seal researchers at UC Santa Cruz have been collaborating with Japanese scientists at NIPR since the 1980s.</p>
<p>Coauthor and principal investigator Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the UCSC Institute of Marine Sciences, has been a pioneer in the development and use of electronic tags to track the movements and behavior of marine mammals. NIPR scientists have developed many innovative sensors and data loggers for use in these studies, including the miniature video cameras used to record whisker movements and an accelerometer attached to the seal&#8217;s jaw that indicates when it is feeding.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study is part of an amazing long-term collaboration between UCSC and the National Institute of Polar Research, starting in the late 1980s with Burney Le Boeuf and Yasu Naito, and continuing with other investigators like myself, Roxanne Beltran, Akinori Takahashi, and now Taiki Adachi,&#8221; Costa said. "They have been bringing state-of-the-art instrumentation that has truly enriched our elephant seal research program.&#8221;</p>
<p>The technology enabled researchers to observe elephant seals foraging in the extreme environment of the deep, dark ocean. The video logger was equipped with an LED red/infrared-light flash which was not visible to the seal, but allowed the researchers to observe noninvasively how the seals use their whiskers as they approach their prey. The cameras showed that the seals captured moving prey by sensing the water movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The jaw loggers measure feeding events, so we could see what they were doing with their whiskers in relation to feeding, and it matches up well,&#8221; Robinson said.</p>
<p>Unlike humans, most mammals have mobile facial whiskers (called &#8220;vibrissae&#8221;). Elephant seals have the highest number of nerve fibers per whisker of any mammal. The deep ocean is relatively &#8220;quiet&#8221; in terms of hydrodynamic vibrations, and elephant seals may even be able to detect the breathing currents of an immobile fish as it moves water over its gills, the authors said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings solve a decades-long mystery about how deep-diving seals locate their prey without the biosonar used by whales, revealing another mammalian adaptation to complete darkness,&#8221; Adachi said.</p>
<p>This research complements earlier whisker studies conducted on mammals in captive conditions, and it propels forward the field of sensory ecology of foraging. &#8220;The next step is conducting comparative field studies on other mammals to better understand how whisker-sensing shapes natural behavior in each mammalian species under different environments,&#8221; said Adachi.</p>
<p>In addition to Adachi, Robinson, and Costa, the coauthors of the paper include Yasuhiko Naito and Akinori Takahashi at NIPR; Luis A. Hu&#776;ckst&#228;dt and Rachel Holser at UC Santa Cruz; and Wataru Iwasaki at the University of Tokyo.</p>
<p>The research was funded by grants from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the U.S. Office of Naval Research, and the E&amp;P Sound and Marine Life Joint Industry Project of the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5df3bf448072704664be42b40e1b761a"><name>commencement-coverage-slug-crossings-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Joy and perseverance</title><summary>Commencement week was a grand celebration that included Slug Crossings, heartfelt speeches, cap tossing, photo ops, and accessorized cap-and-gown outfits.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>With laurels of dollar bills, gigantic neckties and oversized footwear, graduating UC Santa Cruz students sought to reflect the distinctiveness of their campus experience with personal touches.&#160;</p>
<p>Each graduate can share stories about obstacles, perseverance and success&#8212;and about the family and friends who provided help and support along the way. Thousands of Banana Slugs became alumni by earning their degrees and marking the start of a new chapter in their lives.&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commencement 2022 was a combination of virtual and in-person experiences. Virtual commencement launched on June 9 on the commencement website, while Slug Crossing, the campus&#8217;s in-person commencement ceremonies, ran from June 9&#8211;12 on the East Field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of those receiving graduate and undergraduate diplomas have been at UCSC during a pandemic that forced a prolonged period of remote learning as well as the devastating </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/campus-wildfire-evacuation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CZU Lightning Complex fire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that caused extensive damage in Santa Cruz County in 2020, and forced a campus evacuation.</span></p>
<div class="callout-right narrow">
<h3>Celebrate the Slugs</h3>
<p>Hundreds of family, friends, students and employees offered their congratulations to members of the graduating class. <a href="https://celebrate.ucsc.edu">Check out the message board</a>.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your journey through UC Santa Cruz, from your first moment on campus to this commencement today, has been unique,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;Among today&#8217;s graduates are tomorrow&#8217;s filmmakers and linguists, biologists and musicians, teachers and engineers, entrepreneurs and public servants. We celebrate your many accomplishments during your time at UC Santa Cruz, and we look ahead with anticipation to everything you may do next.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly 5,000 UC Santa Cruz students earned undergraduate and graduate degrees for work completed during the 2021&#8211;22 academic year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miguel Zacarias (Porter, &#8217;22, film/psychology) walked across the East Field on Friday while wearing a graduation outfit that his family accessorized to include folded-up five, ten, twenty and fifty dollar bills, some of them woven into a pale green crown he wore on his head, others turned into garlands and a necktie.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His family stayed up late into the night folding those graduation cash gifts into items of clothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My parents came from Riverside to be here,&#8221; Zacarias said. &#8220;The rest of the family came from Sonoma. My heart was just beating when I saw them. It is so nice to have a big crowd of people supporting you.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas Robinett (Porter, &#8216;22, film and sociology) looked like a one-man beach party, posing for photographs while wearing an inflatable floatation device shaped like a pink flamingo. &#8220;This represents my lifeline, my family, who helps me stay afloat with their words of encouragement and love.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Great metaphor,&#8221; said one of his friends, Sean Stubo (Porter, &#8216;22, film), who pointed to Robinett&#8217;s sandaled feet. &#8220;He flip-flopped it!&#8221; Stubo said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearby, Andrea Duran (Porter, &#8216;22, critical race and ethnic studies) towered over the grass in her big white boots. &#8220;These boots add height, excitement, and a little risk,&#8221; Duran said, noting that the footwear increased her chance of falling on the uneven field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duran said her outfit showed confidence as well as authenticity. &#8220;I am first generation,&#8221; she said proudly. &#8220;Both of my parents are migrants from Central America.&#8221; Though she started out feeling uncomfortable in higher education, &#8220;I was able to meet people who shared my identity and create spaces where I felt comfortable. And my parents encouraged me to keep going.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that she has finished her studies at UCSC, she is looking into masters programs in public health and community education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those Slug Crossings were livestreamed so well-wishers at home could join in. Many participants added a personal touch by including vivid photos, aphorisms and enthusiasms. Torrey Delphine Brownell, receiving a B.S. in biology, held up a large white and silver cat. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;m going from here, but I promise it won&#8217;t be boring,&#8221; wrote Brownell, slightly paraphrasing a famous quote by the late rock legend David Bowie during his 50th birthday bash.</span></p>
<p><strong>Following in the footsteps of John R. Lewis</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina Blake </span>(<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;22, John R. Lewis, political science and government), an undergraduate teaching assistant and residential advisor, had galvanizing words at the first commencement ceremony held for the graduating students of the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/05/johnlewiscollegeceremony.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly rededicated John R. Lewis College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in memory of the late leader, activist, and organizer whose bravery and conviction helped pave the way for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis later served 30-plus years in the House of Representatives, where he became known as the &#8220;conscience of Congress&#8221; for his commitment to justice and equity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ou may not know that Congressman Lewis actually lost in 1977 when he ran in the Georgia special election,&#8221; Blake said. &#8220;Despite his initial defeat, he never gave up or stopped his fight for justice and equality, and just under a decade later entered the House for the first time. All of this is to say that while you may be faced with adversity as you pursue your passions, persistence will guide you, and I hope you take some time to reflect on how you can continue to challenge systemic racism and anti-Blackness on every level.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>A stellar speaker&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Astronomy and astrophysics Ph.D. recipient </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda Quirk, one of the distinguished speakers at the Grad Division festivities, established herself as a bonafide Slug star this year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, she won </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/amanda-quirk-grad-slam-champion.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the UCSC Grad Slam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Kuumbwa jazz venue in downtown Santa Cruz, which came with a $3,000 prize. In May, she </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/05/amandaquirktriumph.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">came in second</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a field of 10 contenders at the UC-systemwide Grad Slam finals. She wowed judges with her lightning-fast presentation, &#8220;The Tale of Two Galaxies: Studying How Galaxies Change Over Time.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She emphasized shared pride, teamwork, and persistence during the Graduate Division commencement ceremony. About 240 grad students participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hearing about the projects of other students flairs up my impostor syndrome at times, but it is always alleviated when other grads show excitement about my own work and remind me that we all belong here,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The graduate community is highly collaborative and supportive,&#8221; Quirk continued. &#8220;We read each other&#8217;s grant proposals, share class notes, celebrate each other&#8217;s victories, and listen to each other vent. The graduate students at UCSC prove you can support one another while simultaneously doing groundbreaking work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">They say graduate school is a marathon, not a sprint,&#8221; Quirk said. &#8220;Perhaps a more accurate description is that it is a sprint the length of a marathon.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>An essential part of history</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill College Provost Elizabeth Abrams reminded those in the audience that they are part of campus history: &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little bit of background: You are graduating 50-plus years after the first commencement celebrated by what was then a brand-new Merrill College,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill was born in 1968, &#8220;a historic year of war, protest, and direct action by young people who had educated themselves into believing that if change was going to happen, they would have to be that change,&#8221; Abrams said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have been told by those who helped found the college that the defining question at Merrill in those early days&#8212;the question asked by students and faculty alike&#8212;was, &#8216;What is my relationship to the revolution?&#8217; In other words&#8212;what role do I play, what part is my part, in the making of our unfolding history?&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Stirring words at Oakes</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s ceremony at Oakes College recognized Carlos Lucatero (Oakes &#8217;22, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin American and Latino studies and politics [double major]), recipient of this year&#8217;s J. Herman Blake Award, which goes to graduates who best exemplify the founding college provost&#8217;s commitment to social service and justice. Lucatero has worked as an</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Oakes Peer Mentor, Oakes Senate Chair, and Oakes core course assistant, and served on the Oakes Student Life team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucatero (who uses the pronoun &#8220;they&#8221;) spoke candidly about early obstacles in college, and how they were able to weather the difficult times.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Quite honestly, I did not think I&#8217;d make it here,&#8221; Lucatero told the Oakes crowd. &#8220;In my first quarter at UC Santa Cruz in 2018, I was sure that I wanted to transfer or drop out. Back in high school, I was a big fish&#8212;student body president, drama club, two-sport athlete&#8212;yet starting at Santa Cruz, I had nothing.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucatero recalled the first few weeks of college,&#160; sitting in the dining hall, or hiding out in a dorm room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was scared and alone,&#8221; Lucatero said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was terrified</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that this would be my life for four years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But something brought me out of my shell: the Oakes College Core course.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was in that class of fellow Oakes first years where I felt myself come into my own as a college student,&#8221; Lucatero continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s where I met some of my closest friends to this day, and where I realized what I wanted to do with my life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Core, Lucatero read texts by radical thinkers like the late American scholar of Chicana cultural history Gloria Anzald&#250;a, who taught at UC Santa Cruz and received a posthumous doctorate from the campus in 2005, and Angela Davis, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">activist, author, and distinguished UC Santa Cruz professor emerita.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But most importantly, we were able to have open and honest conversations with each other about our life experiences and how they shaped us,&#8221; Lucatero said. &#8220;Core was a space for opportunity&#8212;where I could be as brown as I wanted, and as queer as I wanted. Where I knew I could learn from my peers about how to be a better ally, a better activist, a better friend, and a better person.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5e970e4b8072704664be42b49141832a"><name>cantu-center-feature-story-pw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>A welcoming place in the redwoods</title><summary>The Lionel Cantú Queer Resource Center is a place for students to claim and proclaim their voices.</summary><start-date>1655150400000</start-date><display-name>cantucenterfeatureptownsend</display-name><path>/2022/06/cantu-center-feature-story-pw</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/cantu-center-feature-story-pw</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1655149366837</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1655937550959</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/cantucentergroupcarolyn400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/cantucentergroupcarolyn400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cantucentergroupcarolyn400.jpg</name><display-name>cantucentergroupcarolyn400.jpg</display-name><file-size>72706</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/cantucenter80thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/cantucenter80thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cantucenter80thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>cantucenter80thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>22188</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>From left: Sarah Donovan, Camila Alvarado, and Bridge Kennedy.

This cantilevered wood structure has floor-to-ceiling windows, cozy couches, and a refrigerator full of Capri Sun juice packets for anyone who might happen to want one. <span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>Its out-of-the-way, homey feel belies the important work that has happened between its four walls over the past 33 years, according to those involved with the center.</p>
<p>The center has built a strong and active community of LGBTQIA+ students and staff, hosted myriad gatherings like Queer Prom and Lavender Graduation, and offered resources and help for housing and financial aid. It has also pushed for greater inclusivity on campus, including the establishment of all-gender restrooms.</p>
<p>The center&#8217;s cobbled-together budget is small, but talk to students involved with the center and they will&#160;describe how the Cant<span>&#250;, as it is informally called,</span> provides a wide range of services: free clothes and shoes so students can experiment with different gender expression in a safe space, a place to get food when they run out of funds, and a setting where they can be with others who share their experiences and, sometimes, even find their own identity.</p>
<p>Its new director delfin bautista (they prefer lower-case) promises to continue and expand the center&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>The Cant<span>&#250; Center, they said, is historically a place where folks can come together to recognize &#160;they are not alone and also find their power in order to advocate for their needs.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a place where folks have claimed, reclaimed, and proclaimed their voices,&#8221; bautista said.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>A long history</span></strong></p>
<p>The history of the Cant&#250; Center is scattered but it roots appear to lie in 1971, six years after UC Santa Cruz opened its doors. That was the year students formed the Gay Student Union (GSU). Four years later, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance (GALA) came into being, followed 14 years after that by the establishment of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Network Resource Center.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until 1997, however, that the center got its first director. Deborah Abbott, a writer, health activist, alum and river guide was named to head what was called the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center. The position was three-quarters time with a tiny budget and no staff.</p>
<p>In an oral history from 2002, Abbott recalled walking into the space with its potted plants and ever-hot tea kettle and feeling at home. The director also felt the neglect the space had endured while being piloted by a succession of capable but busy students over the previous seven years.</p>
<p>Abbott went to work, she said, haunting second-hand stores for better furniture, dismantling cliques that had been established, making sure all students felt welcome &#8212; especially students of color &#8212; and creating connections with other campus groups, while also retaining the center&#8217;s hominess.</p>
<p>&#8220;It felt really important to me to create a feeling of home, of welcome, for queer students who don&#8217;t often have a home they can go back to, who get cut off from their families, either partially or completely,&#8221; Abbott said in the oral history.</p>
<p>In 2004, the Center was renamed the Lionel Cant&#250; Queer Resource Center after a beloved assistant professor of sociology, Lionel Cant&#250; Jr., who died unexpectedly of cardiac arrest in 2002 at the age of 36. An openly gay professor whose research focused on the impact of sexuality and migration, he spent countless hours being available to students at the center and supporting its programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cant&#250; has provided me with a community I didn&#8217;t quite know existed,&#8221; said Sarah Donovan, an Oakes College politics major and economics minor who interns with the center and will graduate this year. &#8220;With Cant&#250; I&#8217;ve grown more than ever with myself in terms of gender and sexuality. I felt a lot of my life that I had to hide myself to fit in and survive, and being at the Cant&#250; is the exact opposite experience. I didn&#8217;t have to hide myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#160;<strong>Many achievements</strong></p>
<p>Probably the center&#8217;s most visible achievement was its successful drive to establish all-gender restrooms at UC Santa Cruz. Currently, there are 55 all-gender public restrooms on campus, according to records.&#160;</p>
<p>Inside the space are other signs of the Cant&#250;&#8217;s quiet success. There are cupboards and a refrigerator filled with food that is free to students who need it and racks of clothes to fit different gender expressions.</p>
<p>There are shelves of books that center on queer stories and history, and a supply of free items that may be expensive or hard to shop for: binders to flatten breasts, and packers to provide a masculine bulge in pants and bras with insertable cups. It also offers tampons, shaving cream and razors.</p>
<p>A recent pop-up on campus featuring free clothing that ranged across possible gender expressions drew 200 visitors,<span>&#160; </span>bautista said.</p>
<p>Maybe even more importantly, the center helps students find resources they may not know about. <span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I needed a lot of support with financial aid when I got to campus,&#8221; said Camila Alvarado, a Stevenson College double major in art and history of art and visual culture who will graduate next year and is also an intern at the center. &#8220;The Cant&#250; helped guide me through it. They got me in contact with people I wouldn&#8217;t have access to. I also needed a lot of support exploring more about myself and the <span>Cant</span><span>&#250;</span><span> </span>creates those opportunities.&#8221; Now Alvarado hopes to&#160;pass these experiences on to younger students.</p>
<p><span>For Bridge Kennedy, a legal studies and sociology major from Stevenson College who will graduate this year and also interns at the center, the Cant</span><span>&#250;</span><span> provided critical help. It helped them find housing after a bad experience with roommates and provided the mentorship they needed.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I just really looked up to the older queer students,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;They seemed to move through space with such confidence and ease. I saw them as role models and the type of young adult I wanted to grow into.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>bautista sees the center&#8217;s work continuing and expanding. </span></p>
<p><span>They plan more outreach into the greater Santa Cruz community; a focus on self-care for students, staff and instructors; a resource list for students who want to work on national issues; and a strengthening of the center&#8217;s inclusion work. </span></p>
<p><span>A recent LGBTQ pool party on campus was a first step in creating awareness for an increase in accessible and inclusive athletics and recreation facilities, bautista said.</span></p>
<p><span>bautista also wants to strengthen the center&#8217;s academic outreach in order to &#8220;bring another lens into the classroom,&#8221; they said.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;So, for instance, if a class is discussing civil rights, we will invite them, challenge them, to include a discussion of Bayard Rustin,&#8221; Bautista said. Rustin was a mentor to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a chief organizer of the March on Washington but, because he was a gay Black man, his contributions have largely been ignored.</span></p>
<p><span>For bautista, the opportunity to lead the Cant</span><span>&#250;</span><span> Center is a chance to not only raise awareness about the center and continue its work but also &#8220;to celebrate the gifts and contributions of our LGBTQ folks&#8221; in these troubled times.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We need to mourn and grieve but we also need to celebrate resiliency,&#8221; they said. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5f0e5f708072704664be42b47c97ff7a"><name>polar-bear-bruno</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>100,000-year-old polar bear genome reveals ancient hybridization with brown bears</title><summary>Scientists found that all brown bears today have some polar bear ancestry due to genetic admixture that occurred during a warm interglacial period more than 100,000 years ago.</summary><keywords>Beth Shapiro</keywords><start-date>1655391600000</start-date><display-name>100,000-year-old polar bear genome reveals ancient hybridization with brown bears</display-name><path>/2022/06/polar-bear-bruno</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/polar-bear-bruno</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1655157186394</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1655406910419</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/polar-bear-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/polar-bear-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>polar-bear-450.jpg</name><display-name>polar-bear-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>94777</file-size><width>450</width><height>339</height></image><image-alt>polar bear</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/polar-bear-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/polar-bear-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>polar-bear-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>polar-bear-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22951</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>polar bear</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Disappearing sea ice means polar bears are spending more time in Arctic coastal areas where they may encounter brown bears.

<p>The study, led by scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01753-8">published June 16 in <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em></a>. The researchers obtained ancient DNA from the skull of a juvenile polar bear that was found in 2009 on the coast of the Beaufort Sea in Arctic Alaska. Scientists nicknamed the bear &#8216;Bruno,&#8217; although DNA analysis later showed it to be a female.</p>
<p>&#8220;The availability of Bruno&#8217;s paleogenome has made it possible to detect an ancient admixture event that impacted all living brown bears,&#8221; said first author Ming-Shan Wang, a postdoctoral scientist in the <a href="https://pgl.soe.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Paleogenomics Lab</a>.</p>
<p>Corresponding author Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, said the team&#8217;s genomic analyses show that Bruno belonged to a polar bear population that was ancestral to living polar bears. At some point, probably after around 125,000 years ago, she said, the polar bear lineage leading to Bruno and the brown bear lineage leading to all living brown bears crossed paths and hybridized.</p>
<p>As a result of this ancient admixture, polar bear ancestry accounts for as much as 10% of the genomes of brown bears living today. &#8220;We never would have seen this without Bruno&#8217;s genome, because all living brown bears have that admixture as part of their genomes,&#8221; Shapiro said.</p>
<p>Although polar bears and brown bears are distinct species with striking differences in appearance, behavior, and habitats, they are closely related and can readily hybridize when their ranges overlap. Reports of hybrids have increased in recent years as the climate warms and disappearing sea ice forces polar bears onto Arctic coastal areas, while brown bears expand their range northward.</p>
<p>Previous studies of ancient DNA have shown that admixture has occurred in certain populations of brown bears at least four different times between around 15,000 and 25,000 years ago. In all cases, the direction of gene flow was from polar bears into brown bears.</p>
<p>&#8220;The admixed individuals, if they survive, do so as brown bears, perhaps because they have difficulty hunting successfully on the sea ice if they are not completely white,&#8221; Shapiro explained. &#8220;Polar bears have always been a small population with not much genetic diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new study did find some evidence of possible gene flow from brown bears into Bruno&#8217;s lineage, but the absence of admixture in polar bears today supports the idea that brown bear ancestry reduces a bear&#8217;s fitness for life as a polar bear. After diverging from brown bears about 500,000 years ago, polar bears evolved into highly specialized hunters of marine mammals on the Arctic sea ice. Brown bears, in contrast, are generalists ranging widely across North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
<p>Bruno lived during a time of changing climate after the peak of a warm interglacial period when temperatures and sea levels were considerably higher than they are now. Similar conditions can be expected in the future as a result of rapid climate change driven by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities. As Arctic sea ice declines, many polar bear populations are already struggling to survive.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the rapid, unnatural, and severe human-caused warming of the Arctic we are documenting today continues unabated, it is uncertain whether polar bears will have a sea ice habitat to return to and survive genetically,&#8221; said coauthor Ian Stirling, a polar bear biologist and research scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.</p>
<p>According to Shapiro, &#8220;We shouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see admixture happening again today as the climate changes and these species are overlapping and encountering each other again in the wild. Climate change allows gene flow to occur between what we think of as different species.&#8221;</p>
<p>Climatic shifts that have brought polar bears and brown bears together in the past include glacial periods when sea ice was more extensive, allowing polar bears to mix with brown bears in southeast Alaska, the Kuril Islands, and even Ireland. The brown bears in these locations (now extinct in Ireland) acquired additional polar bear genes on top of the ancient admixture revealed by Bruno&#8217;s genome.</p>
<p>As for what brown bears might have gained from their polar bear ancestry, scientists can only speculate. &#8220;It&#8217;s possible that brown bears got something cool from polar bears, but we can&#8217;t say for sure at this point,&#8221; Shapiro said.</p>
<p>Finding Bruno&#8217;s skull was serendipitous. Coauthors Pamela Groves, Daniel Mann and Michael Kunz from the University of Alaska Fairbanks were walking the Beaufort Sea coastline in 2009 surveying for recent coastal erosion when they stumbled upon the skull resting just above the high tide line.</p>
<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t even looking for bones, as typically we find ancient bones a hundred miles inland where they have been stored in permafrost along sleepy rivers,&#8221; said Groves. Since polar bears spend most of their lives at sea, finding any polar bear remains is extremely unusual. Bruno is the only ancient polar bear skull ever recorded and the only ancient polar bear bone known from North America.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understanding how past changes in climate drove interactions between organisms is critical to predicting how current changes will create new admixtures, increase disease transmission, or impact natural resources or society,&#8221; said Leslie Rissler, program director at the U.S. National Science Foundation.</p>

The polar bears survive with limited access to sea ice by hunting from freshwater ice that pours into the ocean from Greenland&#8217;s glaciers. Because this isolated population is genetically distinct and uniquely adapted to its environment, studying it could shed light on the future of the species in a warming Arctic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to survey this region because we didn&#8217;t know much about the polar bears in Southeast Greenland, but we never expected to find a new subpopulation living there,&#8221; said lead author Kristin Laidre, a polar scientist at the University of Washington&#8217;s Applied Physics Laboratory. &#8220;We knew there were some bears in the area from historical records and Indigenous knowledge. We just didn&#8217;t know how special they were.&#8221;</p>
<p>The genetic difference between this group of bears and its nearest genetic neighbor is greater than that observed for any of the 19 previously known polar bear populations.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are the most genetically isolated population of polar bears anywhere on the planet,&#8221; said coauthor Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. &#8220;We know that this population has been living separately from other polar bear populations for at least several hundred years, and that their population size throughout this time has remained small.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk2793">published June 17 in <em>Science</em></a>, combines seven years of new data collected along the southeastern coast of Greenland with 30 years of historical data from the island&#8217;s whole east coast. The remote Southeast region had been poorly studied because of its unpredictable weather, jagged mountains, and heavy snowfall. The newly collected genetic, movement, and population data show how these bears use glacier ice to survive with limited access to sea ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Polar bears are threatened by sea ice loss due to climate change. This new population gives us some insight into how the species might persist into the future,&#8221; Laidre said. &#8220;But we need to be careful about extrapolating our findings, because the glacier ice that makes it possible for Southeast Greenland bears to survive is not available in most of the Arctic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of the reason the population is so isolated, researchers believe, is that the bears are hemmed in on all sides: by the sharp mountain peaks and massive Greenland Ice Sheet to the west, the open water of the Denmark Strait to the east, and by the fast-flowing East Greenland coastal current that poses a hazard offshore.</p>
<p>Before starting the fieldwork, the team spent two years soliciting input and gathering information from polar bear subsistence hunters in East Greenland. Hunters participated throughout the study, contributing their expertise, and providing harvest samples for genetic analysis.</p>
<p>The satellite tracking of adult females shows that, unlike most other polar bears that travel far over sea ice to hunt, Southeast Greenland bears are homebodies. They walk on ice inside protected fjords or scramble up mountains to reach neighboring fjords over the Greenland Ice Sheet. Half of the 27 tracked bears accidentally floated an average of 120 miles (190 kilometers) south on small ice floes caught in the East Greenland coastal current, but then hopped off and walked back north on land to their home fjord.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a sense, these bears provide a glimpse into how Greenland&#8217;s bears may fare under future climate scenarios,&#8221; Laidre said. &#8220;The sea ice conditions in Southeast Greenland today resemble what&#8217;s predicted for Northeast Greenland by late this century.&#8221;</p>
<p>Southeast Greenland bears have access to sea ice for only four months, between February and late May. Sea ice provides the platform that most of the Arctic&#8217;s roughly 26,000 polar bears use to hunt seals. But polar bears can&#8217;t fast for eight months. For two-thirds of the year, the Southeast Greenland polar bears rely on a different strategy: They hunt seals from chunks of freshwater ice breaking off the Greenland Ice Sheet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The marine-terminating glaciers in Southeast Greenland are a fairly unique environment,&#8221; said coauthor Twila Moon, deputy lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. &#8220;These types of glaciers do exist in other places in the Arctic, but the combination of the fjord shapes, the high production of glacier ice and the very big reservoir of ice that is available from the Greenland Ice Sheet is what currently provides a steady supply of glacier ice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact that bears can survive here suggests that marine-terminating glaciers, and especially those regularly calving ice into the ocean, could become small-scale climate refugia&#8212;places where some polar bears could survive as sea ice on the ocean&#8217;s surface declines. Similar habitats exist at marine-terminating glaciers on other parts of Greenland&#8217;s coast and the island of Svalbard, a Norwegian territory located east of Greenland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even with rapid changes happening on the ice sheet, this area in Greenland has the potential to continue to produce glacial ice, with a coast that may look similar to today, for a long time,&#8221; Moon said.</p>
<p>The authors estimate that there are roughly a few hundred bears in Southeast Greenland, similar to other small populations. Body measurements suggest that adult females are smaller than in most regions. They also have fewer cubs, which may reflect the challenge of finding mates in the complex landscape of fjords and mountains. Laidre cautioned, however, that longer-term monitoring is needed to know the future viability of Southeast Greenland bears and to understand what happens to polar bear subpopulations as they become increasingly cut off from the rest of the Arctic by declining sea ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re concerned about preserving the species, then yes, our findings are hopeful&#8212;I think they show us how some polar bears might persist under climate change,&#8221; Laidre said. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t think glacier habitat is going to support huge numbers of polar bears. There&#8217;s just not enough of it. We still expect to see large declines in polar bears across the Arctic under climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government of Greenland will decide on any protection and management measures. The International Union for Conservation of Nature, which helps oversee protected species, is responsible for determining whether Southeast Greenland bears are internationally recognized as a separate population, the 20th in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Preserving the genetic diversity of polar bears is crucial going forward under climate change,&#8221; Laidre said. &#8220;Officially recognizing these bears as a separate population will be important for conservation and management.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hibbert-Jones will serve as the Arts Division leader on research, exhibition, and engagement, acting as a point of connection between the </span><a href="https://ari.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arts Research Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ARI), the </span><a href="https://ias.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute of the Arts and Sciences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IAS), the </span><a href="https://art.ucsc.edu/sesnon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, faculty, and the Dean&#8217;s office. One of Hibbert-Jones&#8217; priorities will be to raise the profile and increase the impact of the arts on campus, in the community and region, and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The new Associate Dean of Research, Exhibition and Engagement will bring more visibility to the robust research agenda of the Arts Division at UCSC as well as the exhibition practices that extend our impact beyond campus while also amplifying the regional and global collaborations of our faculty and students,&#8221; says Parre&#241;as Shimizu. &#8220;I created this new position so we can grow Arts faculty leaders in university administration and offer a model of shared leadership in the Arts Division.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hibbert-Jones, who founded UCSC&#8217;s Social Practice Arts Research Center and is currently faculty director of ARI, has a long history of leadership within the Arts Division, having served on numerous college and departmental committees. In addition to being principal faculty in Art, she is affiliate faculty in Film and Digital Media, Digital Arts and New Media, and Legal Studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her work also extends far beyond campus. Hibbert-Jones is an Academy Award&#174; nominated, Emmy&#174; award winning filmmaker and artist and a Guggenheim Fellow. She collaborates with Nomi Talisman on innovative animated film, art, and new media projects on issues of access and inequity, specifically in relation to criminal justice, racial equity, and social infrastructures. Hibbert-Jones was awarded a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">United States Congressional Black Caucus Veterans</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braintrust Award</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in recognition for her outstanding national commitment to civil rights and social justice, and a California Public Defenders Gideon Award for her support to indigent minorities, with Nomi Talisman. She has served on countless government, foundation, nonprofit, and for profit art, film, and academic juries and boards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An award-winning thinker and practitioner in the interdisciplinary arts, Dee Hibbert-Jones exemplifies the generosity of our faculty who are known for nurturing our students in giving them the belief that they can make key contributions in their disciplines, but also for faculty to be encouraged to secure the largest grants to support their deserving research,&#8221; says Parre&#241;as Shimizu. &#8220;She has the vision to strengthen our research output with her ability to inspire faculty and students, bring people together, find resources, and secure relationships that support our research enterprise. All of this will amplify the social impact and engagement that our campus historically pursues and emphasizes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The opportunity to work with my colleagues to envision and integrate UCSC&#8217;s Arts programming and research into a cohesive whole is tremendously exciting to me,&#8221; says Hibbert-Jones. &#8220;There are so many brilliant minds here&#8212;our research is consistently experimental and innovative. I see this position as an opportunity to reflect the depth of talent in the Arts at UCSC. Together with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Rachel Nelson at IAS, Holly Unruh at ARI, and Louise Leong at the Sesnon, we will work to ensure our exceptional resources are fully utilized by our faculty and students, raise the visibility of the wealth of talent, and engage deeply with our community and the public.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the inaugural Associate Dean of Research, Exhibition and Engagement, Hibbert-Jones joins Professor of Music Karlton Hester, recently appointed to the first-time position of Associate Dean of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and Larry Andrews, Associate Dean of Faculty Affairs, on Dean Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu&#8217;s newly forged executive team. Together, the group will work </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to reshape arts education at UCSC in a way t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hat prioritizes the nurturing of faculty well-being, research funding, and mentorship, while addressing pressing issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion, impactful research, and regional and global engagement and exhibition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5f6819008072704664be42b4b593e565"><name>responsible-ai</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Zimmer to develop Responsible AI course </title><summary>Zimmer will join colleagues from around the U.S. to plan classes that better explore the impact of artificial intelligence on our world.</summary><start-date>1655103600000</start-date><path>/2022/06/responsible-ai</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/responsible-ai</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1655163066605</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1655245658629</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Research</value><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Bob Ham</name><title></title><phone/><email>rmham@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/zimmer-zac-400sq.gif</path><link>site://news/2022/06/zimmer-zac-400sq.gif</link><site>news</site><name>zimmer-zac-400sq.gif</name><display-name>zimmer-zac-400sq.gif</display-name><file-size>126683</file-size><width>400</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/nhc-circle-white-444-512sq.png</path><link>site://news/2022/06/nhc-circle-white-444-512sq.png</link><site>news</site><name>nhc-circle-white-444-512sq.png</name><display-name>nhc-circle-white-444-512sq.png</display-name><file-size>11136</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span>Part of Dr. Zimmer's research into digital privacy and subjectivity includes minimizing his online photo footprint.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 20, UC Santa Cruz associate professor of literature Zac Zimmer will join 14 of his colleagues from universities and colleges around the U.S. at the National Humanities Center (NHC) to discuss and develop undergraduate courses to help ready students to better understand the impact of artificial intelligence on our world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed the Responsible Artificial Intelligence Curriculum Design Project, the inaugural program, funded in part by a gift from Google, was created in response to a conference held last spring at the NHC which dug into the areas where the humanities and artificial intelligence merge, such as the use of AI technologies in the creation of art, the ethics of using facial recognition in surveillance and police work, and whether or not it&#8217;s possible to build morality into machine learning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz was just one of dozens of schools who took part in a competitive grant process that would allow them to be part of this prestigious program. With support from Dean of Humanities Jasmine Alinder, Zimmer put forth a proposal built from his research into comparative studies of technology with a focus on Latin America &#8212; work that touches on similar issues concerning the use of AI.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m interested in the connections between subjectivity and privacy in digital and online settings,&#8221; Zimmer said, &#8220;but also historicizing the changes that we&#8217;re living through right now &#8212; connecting it to specific historical events. My training in Latin American literature and cultural studies focusing on the colonial period led me to see that the rhetoric of newness in technology has blinded us to analogous issues that have played out historically. We can learn a lot from studying those examples in a comparative framework.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Professor Zimmer is an innovative teacher and scholar,&#8221; Alinder said. &#8220;His humanistic approach to the study of technology is exemplary and is aligned with the Humanities Division's goal to provide courses and degrees that foster critical thinking about social and cultural systems."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of this new Responsible AI course is part of a larger initiative at UC Santa Cruz to help share resources and make connections between engineering students and those studying the humanities, arts, and social sciences. Earlier this year, it was announced that the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) awarded a grant to UC Santa Cruz to create a Certificate in the Humanities that would introduce students enrolled in the Baskin School of Engineering to humanities disciplines. Dean Alinder is the PI on the project and Zimmer is also part of the team helping develop that program, which will be launched in the next school year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new curriculum focused on artificial intelligence is coming along at an ideal moment as it has become a fixture in the world at large. In addition to front-facing uses as chatbots on retail websites or in apps to help fix grammar and spelling mistakes, the technology has spread far and wide into nearly every major industry in ways that are much harder to see on the surface.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of how artificial intelligence is being used behind the scenes is of particular interest to Zimmer. He&#8217;s recently been exploring the use of training set data in the development of machine learning algorithms.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The training sets are the initial data that a machine learning algorithm &#8216;reads&#8217; as it learns how to do its assigned task,&#8221; Zimmer said. &#8220;As it turns out, training data sets are hard to come by, and as a result, are quite valuable. One of the most famous publicly available training sets is the Enron corpus: half a million emails exchanged between Enron employees as that scandal-ridden corporation lurched towards collapse in December of 2001. My research explores the implications of a generation of algorithms trained on data sets like this federally subpoenaed mash of fraudulent activity and banal corporate pleasantries.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zimmer already has some strong ideas in mind about potential ideas for the course that he will be mapping out this month at NHC, but he&#8217;s mostly excited at the prospect of being able to further develop them with the help of his colleagues and to help share the impact of their work on students when they reconvene at the Center in 2024.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a collaborative experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really looking forward to learning from other people&#8217;s perspectives. The idea is that each of us is going to come out of the institute with a designed course. Each fellow is going to have their own course design but we&#8217;re going to share resources and work on things together and talk through things together.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="63385a248072704664be42b4bc87e45f"><name>younger-lagoon-course</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Students dip their toes into coastal science at Younger Lagoon</title><summary>Ocean Sciences Professor Carl Lamborg uses Younger Lagoon Reserve to teach Field and Lab Methods in Aquatic and Coastal Science.</summary><start-date>1655190000000</start-date><display-name>Students dip their toes into coastal science at Younger Lagoon</display-name><path>/2022/06/younger-lagoon-course</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/younger-lagoon-course</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1655227046418</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1655227552079</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Kathleen Wong, UC NRS</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/laura-chain-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/laura-chain-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>laura-chain-450.jpg</name><display-name>laura-chain-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>105336</file-size><width>450</width><height>365</height></image><image-alt>Laura Chain</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/laura-chain-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/laura-chain-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>laura-chain-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>laura-chain-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21610</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Laura Chain</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Laura Chain gathers a sediment sample for Field and Lab Methods in Aquatic and Coastal Science, a new class based at the NRS&#8217;s Younger Lagoon Reserve.

Clad in black waders&#8212;voluminous rubber pants with boots attached, held up by suspenders&#8212;she steps gingerly into the yellow-green water.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little weird getting in because I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;m putting my feet,&#8221; Chain says.</p>
<p>Once wet to her knees, Chain plunges the clear plastic cylinder she carries perpendicularly into the water, driving it into the mud at her feet. Tugging the contraption free, she smiles in triumph. Inside the push corer is a neatly stacked column of lagoon sediments. It&#8217;s exactly what her lab group needs for the geology segment of <em>Field and Lab Methods in Aquatic and Coastal Science</em> (ESCI/OCEA 150).</p>
<p>Immersion in the field is exactly what instructor Carl Lamborg wants his class to experience. A professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, Lamborg has students characterize the biology, chemistry, geology, and physics of Younger Lagoon Reserve over the course of a quarter. The 72-acre reserve adjacent to the university&#8217;s Coastal Science Campus is one of 41 protected sites in the UC Natural Reserve System.</p>
<p>The class alternates between taking samples and measurements on the reserve one week, and analyzing the materials in the laboratory the next. Teams visit several sites around the lagoon itself, as well as at its ocean mouth. Along the way, these science majors gain practical experience with instruments used to characterize aquatic and marine environments, while gaining insights into processes that shape the Central California coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a general need for experiential learning,&#8221; Lamborg says. &#8220;You learn to make a plan, and organize your equipment, and remember to bring the fresh batteries. It also helps you figure out whether you&#8217;re interested in this type of work as a career.&#8221;</p>
<p>Developing practical research skills is what drew environmental sciences major Edward Palma to the class. &#8220;This gives me an idea of what actual scientists do when they&#8217;re going out to the ocean, ponds, and lakes,&#8221; he says, peering down through another cylinder of lagoon water. He poured out a few inches before trying again to discern the black and white pattern at its base. The depth at which the pattern appears is a standard method for measuring water clarity.</p>
<p>The chance to get a glimpse of a job as a field researcher also convinced Ariaeli Hernandez-Viera to sign up. &#8220;I want to go into restoration ecology, which involves a lot of field work and possibly lab work too. So it&#8217;s good for me to have as much field work especially under my belt as I can before going out into the workforce,&#8221; says the graduating environmental studies major.</p>
<p>Having to extract smelly lagoon mud hasn&#8217;t convinced Hernandez-Viera to veer from her intended career course. &#8220;I had a fear that when I went for a job I might find it boring or too much hard work. But I&#8217;m having fun with this class so it gives me hope that I&#8217;ll find a job that I&#8217;ll have fun doing,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>For environmental science major Natasha Puri, who transferred to UCSC the year the pandemic struck, the class was her last chance to take a field course. She jumped at the opportunity. &#8220;I like being outside. I like touching the water, seeing the zooplankton, how they actually look and how they behave. I feel like you absorb so much more information when you see it than being in a classroom,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Puri has applied for a summer job removing invasive trout from Yosemite National Park largely on the strength of her aquatic methods experiences. &#8220;I might not have considered applying without having taken the class. I can see that I have a feel for it. And that makes me feel less intimidated to pursue field work as a career.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lamborg says wrangling equipment shoulder to shoulder with students encourages conversations that ultimately help him serve as a mentoring resource. &#8220;All of the students are getting very close to the end of their college career. So as we chat, I ask them what they&#8217;re going to do next, and see if anybody has questions about how I get into grad school or what kinds of jobs I can do with this degree,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The fact that the class is held at one of Santa Cruz&#8217;s loveliest coastal locales doesn&#8217;t hurt. With waters that reflect scudding overhead clouds and a pocket beach sprouting multicolored wildflowers, the reserve is a picture of natural beauty all year round. The fact that the lagoon is open to classes and researchers but not the general public (except by free docent-led tours) only adds to its mystique.</p>
<p>Lamborg, however, says he chose Younger for its dynamic conditions, not its charms. &#8220;Because it&#8217;s a small enough system, I was hoping we would see big changes during the course of a quarter, where the various chemical, physical, and biological aspects of it might actually change,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The lagoon has obliged by being as mutable as Lamborg had hoped. Its pH and dissolved oxygen levels have been rising, as photosynthetic phytoplankton have proliferated during the progressively longer days. Meanwhile, biology samples taken by the class have revealed turnover in plankton species as water conditions have shifted. Dinoflagellates have given way to cyanobacteria as the lagoon has warmed and lost water to evaporation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, COVID has made the laboratory sections of the class extra valuable. Instructional videos were the closest many students had come to lab learning over the past two years. But in this class, students get to stain bacteria in water samples, observe swimming plankton under a microscope, measure the grain sizes of beach and lagoon sediments, and perform other lab analyses with their own hands.</p>
<p>For the course final, each student group will analyze one of the four types of data&#8212;biology, geology, physics, or chemistry&#8212;the class has gathered over the term, and give a presentation on the trends observed.</p>
<p>The data students glean may have a life beyond the course as well. &#8220;My hope is the course will be offered here regularly in the future. We could start to build a longer term data set that we could potentially offer up to other researchers,&#8221; says Younger Lagoon Reserve director Elizabeth Howard. &#8220;Even more could be gained from coming back multiple times through the year, over multiple years of drought and heavy rainfall.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chance to contribute to ongoing research should only add to the allure of the class for future students.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="640cb78f8072704664be42b486207e18"><name>sc-launchpad-22</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Ingenious, tech-based solutions pitched at Santa Cruz Launchpad 2022</title><summary>The annual UC Santa Cruz business pitch competition and job fair drew in 19 student teams, 25 local companies, and nearly 500 attendees.</summary><start-date>1655239500000</start-date><path>/2022/06/sc-launchpad-22</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/sc-launchpad-22</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1655240963955</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1655938666838</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa Weckerle</name><title></title><phone/><email> mweckerl@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/twostudents350.png</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/twostudents350.png</link><site>news</site><name>twostudents350.png</name><display-name>twostudents350.png</display-name><file-size>189518</file-size><width>350</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt>Two students wearing masks present at a booth.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/twostudents80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/twostudents80.png</link><site>news</site><name>twostudents80.png</name><display-name>twostudents80.png</display-name><file-size>18186</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Two students wearing masks present at a booth.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The Santa Cruz Works booth featured at the SC Launchpad event.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/winners350.png</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/winners350.png</link><site>news</site><name>winners350.png</name><display-name>winners350.png</display-name><file-size>189616</file-size><width>350</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt>A group of students and advisors hold checks.</image-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">From left to right: Andrea Carafa, CIED entrepreneur in residence, Manel Camps, CIED faculty director, and Kati Greaney, CIED coordinator, pictured between the first and fourth place teams. </span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fifth annual student business pitch competition and job fair, known as Santa Cruz Launchpad, was held last week at the UC Santa Cruz Hay Barn.

From June 2022 through Nov. 2023, the institute will partner with the </span><a href="https://www.cfmco.org/salinas-inclusive-economic-development-initiative-siedi/#:&#126;:text=What%20is%20SIEDI%3F,communities%20of%20the%20Salinas%20Valley."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salinas Inclusive Economic Development Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SIEDI), a collective of nine community organizations, in an effort to shift the region&#8217;s economic landscape to reduce inequality and improve financial stability and quality of life for local families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Salinas is one of five &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.irvine.org/insights/expanding-grantmaking-in-priority-communities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">priority communities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; in California&#8212;alongside Fresno, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Stockton&#8212;that the Irvine Foundation has identified as having less diversified economies and a disproportionate number of low-paying jobs, with the majority of low-wage workers being people of color. The foundation&#8217;s grants in these communities are aimed at increasing economic advancement opportunities for workers through creation of new, better-paying jobs with worker protections, benefits, and pathways to advancement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institute for Social Transformation was a natural partner for this work in Salinas in part because of director Chris Benner&#8217;s expertise as a scholar of equitable economic development. Benner, a Professor of Sociology and Environmental Studies, has been working for the past 20 years with a colleague at the University of Southern California to develop a framework for how to address inequality, social divisions, and ecological destruction by bolstering aspects of our economy that are built upon mutuality and collaboration.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2021 book </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/solidarity-economics.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidarity Economics: Why Mutuality and Movements Matter</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, lays out the theory and strategies behind this approach. And now, the new grant-funded work with SIEDI will offer an opportunity to apply and refine those principles in partnership with the community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of that work, The Institute for Social Transformation will join SIEDI in a planning process to set specific indicators&#8212;based on the group&#8217;s goals for economic transformation in the region&#8212;that can be used to track progress on a neighborhood, city, and regional scale. The institute will then evaluate data availability around these indicators, with the hope of creating an online economic analysis tool to support the work of SIEDI members.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This type of data is powerful for a variety of reasons,&#8221; Benner explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s useful in showing trends and conditions in our economy, but it's also powerful as a way of promoting dialogue, connection, and understanding. And that&#8217;s most effective when data is in the hands of stakeholders: people who care and are trying to promote an inclusive economy in the region.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The institute will also work to develop an interactive &#8220;power mapping&#8221; tool for SIEDI, which will help community organizations visualize who has power over economic development decisions in the region and which people and groups to engage with in order to influence those processes. Within the private sector, Benner says this can be particularly difficult to determine, since corporate decisions are often made behind closed doors, without public accountability.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The challenging part is figuring out who's open to being influenced and how to influence them,&#8221; Benner said. &#8220;Some people and companies are going to have values more aligned with inclusive economic development, and some will be more aligned with the status quo of inequality. But understanding which people and institutions shape the economic decision-making ecosystem and who has potential to be on our side can help with prioritizing where to invest time and effort.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership with SIEDI also includes communications projects that will involve students from the </span><a href="https://everettprogram.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everett Program for Technology and Social Change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which Benner leads. UC Santa Cruz undergraduate students Mia Perez, Katheline Vanegas, Gordon Schwabe and Nicasio Inchausti have already been working with the member organizations in SIEDI to develop an interactive &#8220;story map&#8221; visualization that will share the goals and work of each organization and SIEDI as a whole.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Interacting with the community organizations and getting to know everyone has been one of my favorite parts of this project,&#8221; Vanegas said of the experience. &#8220;I&#8217;ve learned a lot about how people and organizations work together to better each other and the community. This is truly a community where people take care of one another, and I&#8217;m excited to channel that message through the story map.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students will also help with creating videos and publications to reach wider audiences with lessons from inclusive economic development efforts in Salinas. Ultimately, the team hopes that SIEDI&#8217;s work can set an example for economic transformation far beyond the region.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8203;&#8203;&#8221;We exist in an economic system where people are exploited, so it's really inspiring and motivating to see people who are fighting back against that,&#8221; Inchausti said. &#8220;They&#8217;re really coming at it from a humanistic perspective that is about support, sustainability, and community.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="722173f9807270464be562b54f83855c"><name>restoration-roi</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Study shows mangrove and reef restoration yield positive returns on investment for flood protection</title><summary>A robust analysis demonstrates that nature-based solutions to reduce the damage caused by coastal flooding are cost-effective.</summary><keywords>Michael Beck</keywords><start-date>1655449200000</start-date><display-name>Study shows mangrove and reef restoration yield positive returns on investment for flood protection</display-name><path>/2022/06/restoration-roi</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/restoration-roi</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1655477203926</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1655478034495</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/mangroves-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/mangroves-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mangroves-450.jpg</name><display-name>mangroves-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>96678</file-size><width>450</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>mangroves at sunset</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/mangroves-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/mangroves-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mangroves-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>mangroves-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17988</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>mangroves at sunset</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Mangroves provide valuable protection for coastlines around the globe.

<p>The study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2022.101440">published May 28 in the journal <em>Ecosystem Services</em></a>, used methods from the risk and insurance industry to provide rigorous valuations of these natural defenses and show that they can deliver a positive return on investment, with the benefits from reduced flood damage exceeding the costs of restoration.</p>
<p>The results point toward new opportunities to support restoration efforts with funds from sources that support hazard mitigation, climate adaptation, and disaster recovery, including the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</p>
<p>&#8220;We identify a number of funding sources that have traditionally supported artificial &#8216;gray infrastructure,&#8217; such as concrete sea walls, and that could be applied to nature-based solutions,&#8221; said lead author Michael Beck, a research professor in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz who holds the AXA Chair in Coastal Resilience.</p>
<p>Coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs and mangroves act as natural barriers to waves and storm surges and reduce flood damages to people and property. In many places, however, degradation of reefs and coastal wetlands has reduced their natural ability to protect coastlines from flooding and erosion. Effective strategies exist for restoring these critical ecosystems, but funding for restoration projects can be hard to find.</p>
<p>Beck noted that the global spending on disaster recovery is more than 100 times larger than the spending on conservation. &#8220;Recovery funding will grow as climate change increases the impacts from storms, and environmental funding will likely shrink as national budgets are strained by natural disasters,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The study highlights opportunities to align conservation, flood risk reduction, and climate adaptation to reduce storm risks. &#8220;Funding for artificial infrastructure such as seawalls can be redirected to natural defenses, which provide multiple benefits beyond coastal protection,&#8221; Beck said.</p>
<p>The study&#8217;s results for return on investment are robust to changes in discount rates and the timing of flood protection benefits, he added. &#8220;This may sound esoteric, but it can be critical to getting funding for restoration projects from sources such as FEMA,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The researchers identified specific sites where there could be significant returns on investment for coral reef and mangrove restoration across the Caribbean.</p>

This accomplishment is impressive for both the computer engineering feat of processing such a massive amount of data and the incredible dedication and coordination of the researchers involved.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It is an astounding thing that has happened there,&#8221; said Clay Fischer, Project Manager for the UCSC Genome Browser.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of these sequences are assembled by the researchers into a phylogenetic tree that shows the evolutionary history of the virus, with different branches representing the lineages that have mutated throughout the pandemic. This tree is powered by a software tool called <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPhyloPlace"><span class="s2">UShER</span></a> that was developed at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute and is hosted on the <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span class="s2">UCSC Genome Browser website</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many hands from around the world have brought the Genomics Institute these 10 million sequences that live on the UShER tree. Clinicians worldwide have administered tests to be sent off to local labs, which then sent the samples on for sequencing. Once they are sequenced, they become digital files that are uploaded to databases for genomic information such as GISAID, GenBank, or the COG-UK database.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Angie Hinrichs, a senior software architect at the UCSC Genome Browser and self-described &#8220;data wrangler,&#8221; built a pipeline to pull these sequences into the UShER tree automatically. But this process was complicated as some databases, like GISAID, had restrictions that necessitated the manual download of sequences.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;For the first half of 2021, I would download them every night before bed,&#8221; Hinrichs said.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hinrichs has worked at the UCSC Genome Browser for twenty years. She keeps a low profile, usually preferring to work behind the scenes than in the spotlight. But according to her colleagues, her work curating the tree of COVID-19</span><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s4">genomes</span><span class="s1"> and coordinating with the CDC and other health organizations has been of great importance to the pandemic relief effort. She is a part of the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/26/1030017/covid-variants-pangolin-pango-volunteers/"><span class="s2">Pango team of volunteers</span></a> who have been monitoring virus sequences to identify new variants. She takes on the ongoing, daily maintenance of updating and annotating the UShER tree, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/04/usher-covid-tool.html"><span class="s2">which recently became the default software used by the Pangolin tool</span></a>, a system used by health officials worldwide to track the spread of variants in their community.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">UShER was created early in the pandemic, when researchers at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute recognized that tracing the evolution of a quickly evolving global pathogen like COVID-19 would require a phylogenetic tree that was able to handle an unprecedented amount of data. So, the Genomics Institute&#8217;s scientific director David Haussler gathered together a <a href="https://pathogengenomics.ucsc.edu/home"><span class="s2">team to focus on pathogen genomics</span></a>, led by Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Russell Corbett-Detig and including then-postdoc Yatish Turakhia. Turakhia originally wrote the UShER software, which has the ability to rapidly add a new genome sequence to a very large tree of genome sequences.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Making a tree that can handle so much data is an incredible feat of computer engineering that has required herculean efforts from a number of researchers. Before the current pandemic, phylogenetic trees for comparing viral samples were relatively common, but they were built from comparatively small numbers of sequences.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As unprecedented numbers of SARS-CoV-2 sequences became available, the standard tree-building tools simply could not keep up, and researchers often struggled to make sure their analysis kept pace with the amount of samples they would receive. UShER&#8217;s software and the sustained effort of the team made it possible to grow the tree apace with the pandemic&#8217;s flood of sequences.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hinrichs says that her two decades of experience working with the massive amounts of data stored on the UCSC Genome Browser helped prepare her to work with the COVID-19 lineages on UShER.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;This data coordination is what makes our resources really powerful,&#8221; Hinrichs said. &#8220;We have really great resources here, and really great people.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of those great resources is UCSC&#8217;s amazing computing hardware maintained by Jorge Garcia, Haifang Telc, and Erich Weiler. Hinrichs explained that having that computing power has been essential for this project.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Big data is our thing, so we were ready to jump on this,&#8221; she said.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the beginning of the pandemic, the UCSC pathogen genomics team made guesses as to how many COVID-19 sequences the tree would need to be able to handle. Only Corbett-Detig thought it would reach a million &#8211; no one anticipated reaching 10 million.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I still get surprised at how far we&#8217;ve come,&#8221; Turakhia said. &#8220;The unimaginable amount of data we were able to handle and the fact that we are able to make sense of it quickly is mind-boggling as a computational genomicist.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the tree has grown, it has required constant attention and updates. Cheng Ye, an undergrad in Turakhia&#8217;s new lab at UC San Diego, was also able to figure out a way to add new sequences faster when the tree had grown to contain millions of sequences already, and helped develop a tool called MatOptimize that moves sequences around on the tree when more data makes it apparent that the original placement was less optimal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Accumulating reliable data has been instrumental to better understanding what we are up against in the fight against COVID-19 and all its variants. While little was known about this virus at the start of the pandemic, the tree-building tools developed at UC Santa Cruz have helped to put the history of the virus in some perspective and to predict its future, and researchers across campus have <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/covid-19/"><span class="s2">leveraged their expertise</span></a> to aid in the relief efforts. The progress has been astounding; but for the researchers on the browser team, the urgency of their mission and the sheer amount of data that needs to be curated has also been overwhelming at times. Fischer acknowledges that this level of dedication comes at a cost.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It has been two years of blood, sweat, and tears,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8c837099807270464be562b5a1e74338"><name>reefense-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Reefense project aims to meld biology and engineering in novel structures for coastal protection</title><summary>UCSC scientists are part of a DARPA-funded team to develop innovative solutions for coral reef restoration in Florida and the Caribbean to protect coastal infrastructure.</summary><keywords>Michael Beck, Borja Reguero</keywords><start-date>1655881200000</start-date><display-name>Reefense project aims to meld biology and engineering in novel structures for coastal protection</display-name><path>/2022/06/reefense-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/reefense-grant</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1655919833211</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1656005718909</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/coral-reef-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/coral-reef-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coral-reef-450.jpg</name><display-name>coral-reef-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>324793</file-size><width>940</width><height>529</height></image><image-alt>coral reef</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/coral-reef-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/coral-reef-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coral-reef-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>coral-reef-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24387</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>coral reef</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Healthy coral reefs absorb 97 percent of a wave&#8217;s energy, which buffers shorelines from currents, waves, and storms, helping to prevent loss of life and property damage.

The collaborative effort is led by the University of Miami (UM) and funded by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as part of its nationwide <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/reefense">Reefense</a> research program.</p>
<p>The Reefense program aims to develop self-healing, hybrid biological and engineered reef-mimicking structures for coastal protection. DARPA launched the program in response to the challenges of coastal flooding, erosion, and storm damage that increasingly threaten civilian and Department of Defense (DoD) infrastructure and personnel.</p>
<p>The UM-led project, called X-REEFS (neXt generation Reef Engineering to Enhance Future Structures), has received an initial $7.5 million grant, with options of up to $20.9 million. UCSC&#8217;s participation is led by Michael Beck, a research professor in the <a href="https://ims.ucsc.edu/">Institute of Marine Sciences</a> at UC Santa Cruz who holds the AXA Chair in Coastal Resilience, and IMS associate research professor Borja Reguero. Both are adjunct professors in UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/">Coastal Science and Policy Program</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be designing a reef restoration solution that aims to protect coastlines with an engineered structure, which will also grow corals to be resilient in the face of climate change and other stressors,&#8221; said Beck, who is a core member of the project&#8217;s leadership team.</p>
<p>Beck&#8217;s team at UC Santa Cruz has been at the forefront of making the case for the value of nature-based solutions in coastal protection and adaptation to climate change. They have worked with federal agencies and the insurance industry to demonstrate the value of coastal wetlands, coral reefs, and mangroves for coastal defense. Their work includes extensive modeling of the hydrodynamics and wave attenuation benefits of coral reefs and other coastal habitats. Their initial task in the X-REEFS project will be to help design, model, and assess the benefits from innovative restoration solutions with the team at UM&#8217;s world-leading facility for studying the interactions of wind, waves, storms, and shorelines.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be working with UM and Penn State University on innovative reef restoration solutions and making sure they can deliver the high-performance benefits specified by DARPA for the protection of DoD facilities,&#8221; said Beck.</p>
<p>Principal investigator Andrew Baker, director of the Coral Reef Futures Lab at UM&#8217;s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said the team&#8217;s mission is to develop hybrid reefs that combine the wave-protection benefits of artificial structures with the ecological benefits of coral reefs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be working on next generation structural designs and concrete materials, and integrating them with novel ecological engineering approaches to help foster the growth of corals on these structures,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At the same time, we will also be testing new adaptive biology approaches to produce corals that are faster-growing and more resilient to a warming climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The overall goal is to develop, test, and deploy coral-reef-mimicking structures that provide immediate protection from waves and which are also self-building, self-repairing, and able to keep pace with sea level rise over time.</p>
<p>According to Beck, coral reef restoration lags behind other areas of coastal ecosystem restoration. &#8220;We know that coral reefs are protecting coastlines, but we just don&#8217;t know yet how to design reefs that will both restore coral and deliver coastal protection,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A successful, innovative demonstration project that could be used widely would be an incredible advance and could be used across the Caribbean and globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to UM and UCSC, the X-REEFS team also includes experts at the conservation organization SECORE International, Pennsylvania State University, Johns Hopkins University, Texas A&amp;M University, the Florida Aquarium, Florida International University, University of Florida, and the Smithsonian Marine Station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Reefense team builds upon years of successful collaboration, and highlights our optimism in working towards a more resilient future, both for coral reefs and the coastal communities which depend on them,&#8221; said Baker.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ca8ee807270464be562b5c88daf74"><name>black-mens-alliance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Allied for exponential impact</title><summary>The Black Men’s Alliance, established in 1994 as an organization to create community for Black students at UC Santa Cruz, now boasts a population of 60 engaged and active alumni—and wants to expand further. </summary><start-date>1655996400000</start-date><display-name>black-mens-alliance</display-name><path>/2022/06/black-mens-alliance</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/black-mens-alliance</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1656001177781</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1656008149325</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Haneen Zain</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/bmalead.jpg</path><link>site://news/bmalead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bmalead.jpg</name><display-name>bmalead.jpg</display-name><file-size>291302</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/bmathumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/bmathumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bmathumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>bmathumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>30581</file-size><width>80</width><height>53</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Men&#8217;s Alliance boasts a population of 60 engaged and active alumni&#8212;and wants to expand further.&#160;</span></i></p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/bmasecondary.jpg</path><link>site://news/bmasecondary.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bmasecondary.jpg</name><display-name>bmasecondary.jpg</display-name><file-size>178294</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption><em>The Black Men's Alliance's spring event was a networking opportunity for students and alumni.</em></image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/bmasecondary2.jpg</path><link>site://news/bmasecondary2.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bmasecondary2.jpg</name><display-name>bmasecondary2.jpg</display-name><file-size>210184</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption><em>The Black Men's Alliance brought Black barbers to campus at no cost to students.</em></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Casher began attending UC Santa Cruz in 1996, studying biochemistry and molecular biology. He describes his undergraduate experience as tumultuous and challenging with the added caveat of feeling isolated as a Black and Filipino man in Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of on-campus organizations like the Filipino Student Association and especially the </span><a href="https://blackmensalliance.org/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Men&#8217;s Alliance (BMA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Casher (Oakes &#8217;00) was able to find his community as a student and now as an alumnus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being a Black student in the sciences is challenging, and you start to seek community,&#8221; Casher said. &#8220;I think everybody does coming into a university, but finding folks more like yourself, that was a little hard to find in Santa Cruz. So I&#8217;m grateful to the Black Men&#8217;s Alliance for helping bridge that emotional void and gap for myself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Men&#8217;s Alliance student group was formed in 1994 with the purpose of supporting the Black male student population at UCSC. The group hosted weekly meetings where they talked politics, discussed on-campus issues, and emotionally supported one another. Over the years, student participation in the BMA rose and fell. It had been primarily a student-focused organization, rather than engaging alumni, Casher said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2020, Casher found the need to reconvene his community and began informally hosting weekly BMA meetings for UCSC alumni. The group became a space for members to support one another in the wake of the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police in May 2020 and the surge of protests against racism and police brutality that followed nationwide.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC alumnus and BMA Director Patrick Chandler (Rachel Carson &#8217;99, history and politics) said the Black Men&#8217;s Alliance was a place where folks could share openly about the civil unrest without fear of retribution.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the political nature of the time with uprisings and civil disturbances nationwide, some of the guys felt that they wanted to have an avenue where they could just talk,&#8221; Chandler said. &#8220;Talk about the imagery of seeing a Black man die on TV, at the hands of their own government; that&#8217;s not something you see happen to people on national news over, and over, and over again. So we wanted a place where we could just talk, rap, shoot the dozens, and just laugh and share.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, BMA members reflected on their strong desire to make an impact and decided to establish the alumni organization. Casher took the lead, making him a co-founder and president of the organization. The group currently boasts 60 active and engaged alumni and hopes to gain more. Casher said he hopes BMA&#8217;s evolving presence will bridge the gap between students and alumni. In his words, the group is all about &#8220;Black alumni serving Black students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is an opportunity as alumni to reconnect, reconvene, and have an impact,&#8221; Casher said. &#8220;I think we graduate, and we tend to think our impact should now be in our workplaces or our community. But there&#8217;s this amazing connectivity we have as alumni who have been in Santa Cruz. Understanding that there are students who are having that same level of challenge, isolation, and discouragement that we had as undergrads and understanding that we could really have a huge influence on their outcome.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMA alumni have outlined goals to support students and alumni, including networking opportunities and mentorship programs. Their plans also include providing educational programs like financial literacy and debt consolidation classes, reimagining scholarships for students, hosting on-campus community networking events, and in general, being a place for both students and alumni to find community. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Men&#8217;s Alliance fashioned its most recent on-campus spring event to reflect a traditional barbershop in the Black community. Chandler used the example of LeBron James&#8217;s HBO show </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shop: Uninterrupted,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where the NBA star hosts other celebrities, politicians, and athletes to have conversations and debates while in a barbershop.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMA&#8217;s version of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shop</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at UCSC included catered barbecue, networking opportunities, Black barbers giving students fresh cuts, and a photographer providing professional headshots.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The idea was that people could come in, sit and chop it up, and get their hair done and taken care of,&#8221; Chandler said. &#8220;Because when I was at UC Santa Cruz as a student, there weren&#8217;t any Black barbers in town, and it&#8217;s important for people with curly, kinky hair to have someone who knows how to handle it. And so, we had barbers in the back at no cost to the students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For UCSC alumnus and BMA member Kwasi Addae (College Nine &#8217;01, molecular, cellular and developmental biology), the spring event was a great way for him to reconnect with his community and alma mater.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There were a lot of folks that I had never physically seen before [because of the pandemic], so it was really great catching up with those folks,&#8221; Addae said. &#8220;I think it was really cool for the students to see that there is a heritage at this university that reflects upon them, that there are alumni walking around that look like them&#8212;and more importantly than looking like them, have had similar experiences to them, and can potentially help them navigate or commiserate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casher said the organization hopes to be involved with more on-campus events and expand its reach to more students and alumni.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As alumni, we could really have a huge influence on students&#8217; outcome,&#8221; Casher said. &#8220;Their graduation rates, their retention rates, their financial solvency, helping them get into professions, and leveraging our networks to step into that. So I just want to impress on all alumni to be encouraged to engage, network, and get involved with the university and with the alumni groups who are organizing, because the impact is exponential.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

Foundation (NSF) through their Cyber-Physical Systems program, researchers at UC Santa Cruz will lead a five year, multi-institutional project to explore a new vision of engineering cyber-physical systems (CPSs).&#160;</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CPSs are highly complex systems that involve algorithms, networks, and physical components. Examples of CPSs include smart power grids, implantable medical devices, and transportation such as self-driving cars, the latter being the focus of this project.&#160;</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This project aims to rethink the modeling, analyzing, and designing of a new generation of intelligent transportation systems so the algorithms running them are adapted to computational constraints and the systems can run efficiently and reliably. The researchers will collaborate with industry and academic partners to advance CPSs both in research and education through strong training programs for high school and undergraduate students, with a particular focus on creating research opportunities for students from underrepresented backgrounds.</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;This research will have direct impact in the rapidly growing, multi-billion dollar autonomous systems market,&#8221; said Ricardo Sanfelice, lead principal investigator (PI) on the project, professor of electrical and computer engineering, and director of the UCSC Baskin School of Engineering&#8217;s Cyber-Physical Systems Research Center (CPSRC). &#8220;We envision that our results will have a broad impact by improving the safety and reliability of transportation systems, such as aviation systems and self-driving vehicles, in particular, by reducing the carbon footprint of these systems, and training the workforce of the future in key CPSs science.&#8221;</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Designing for adaptability&#160;</strong></span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CPSs face major engineering challenges from the computational limitations of traditional processors as well as the scale and diversity of physical components, which can be human-made structures and/or the natural landscape. In traditional systems, the computers are updated with information from the physical systems only periodically, meaning the system at certain points runs on old information which could jeopardize its safety and performance.</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To solve these problems, this project will focus on codesigning the algorithms and hardware of CPSs so that the physics, hardware, and software are unified. The researchers will use results from verification, implementation, and testing of their new systems to redesign their algorithms, a process which will also happen in an automated fashion as the systems are running.&#160;</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Unlike the current state-of-the-art, this is one of the first proposals in which algorithms and hardware are jointly co-designed, enabling CPS with higher performance, and better safety, at lower cost,&#8221; said Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Heiner Litz, a co-PI on the project who works in the field of computer architecture and hardware.</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This new model of providing feedback to CPSs will allow researchers to create systems that are more adaptive. The new control algorithms will adjust to the specification and the environment they are deployed on and will be tailored to best provide feedback for use by the algorithms.</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We are excited to explore the possibility of leveraging advances in machine learning for the purpose of learning the hardware by an algorithm,&#8221; said Abhishek Halder, assistant professor of applied mathematics and a co-PI on the project. &#8220;By learning the hardware features such as the available power and memory during runtime, a control software may be able to adapt itself to maximize the overall performance of the transportation CPS.&#8221;</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These new tools will reduce overall development cost and time for CPSs, and the new software will be open-source to enable broad reuse.</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;To meet the stringent requirements that intelligent transportation applications demand, such as performance and safety, the algorithms implemented in the control stack require advanced algorithms that exploit data to learn the environment, the physics, and the cyber,&#8221; Sanfelice said. &#8220;We believe this is the best way to enable CPSs to make close-to-optimal decisions.&#8221;</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Collaboration and education&#160;</strong></span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This project will involve vast collaboration across academia and industry, leveraging expertise in fields such as hardware architecture, real-time systems, and hybrid control systems.</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are seven principal investigators on the project: UCSC Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Ricardo Sanfelice; UCSC Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics Abhishek Halder; UCSC Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering </span><span class="s2">Heiner</span><span class="s1"> Litz; UC Berkeley Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Murat Arcak; University of Pennsylvania Associate Professor of Computer and Information Science Linh Thi Xuan Phan; Vanderbilt University Professor of Computer Science Jonathan Sprinkle; and University of Colorado Boulder Assistant Professor of Computer Science Majid Zamani. They will also collaborate with researchers at the Norwegian University of Science Technology and Italy&#8217;s IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca. Professor and Department Chair of Astronomy and Astronomy and Astrophysics Raja GuhaThakurta and Associate Director of Development for Baskin Engineering Alexandria Leckliter will facilitate key outreach.</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The researchers will work with industry partners such as Toyota Motor Engineering &amp; Manufacturing, Toyota Research Institute, Joby Aviation, and Summer Robotics to gather strategic advice about existing hardware and to validate the autonomous transportation systems created by this project. Through this focused collaboration, they aim to bring their work from research to practice.</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In recruiting researchers for this project, the PIs will focus on involving and mentoring women and historically marginalized communities, spanning all levels of education from K-12 to post-docs via UCSC's world-renowned <a href="https://sip.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s3">Science Internship Program</span></a>, the brand-new <a href="https://shadow.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s3">Shadow the Scientists initiative</span></a>, and the <a href="https://mesa.ucsc.edu/student-resources/college-prep.html"><span class="s3">MESA College Prep program</span></a>. Activities will include a CPSs industry seminar series, competitions to create tools and datasets, and integration of research advances into engineering curriculum at several of the participating universities.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to addressing the effectiveness of CPSs, this project presents a vision for reducing&#160; the growing global carbon footprint by promoting an increased use of autonomous systems in transportation.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Transcending the computational challenges of traditional methods, Sanfelice and his team are innovating intelligent transportation systems of the future,&#8221; said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;This grant places our researchers at the forefront of a field critically important in our rapidly changing world, while centering the contributions of our students.&#8221;</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This project is funded through the NSF&#8217;s Cyber-Physical Systems program, under the Frontier category. The proposal was prepared with assistance by the UCSC Cyber-Physical Systems Research Center and the UCSC Office of Research (OR), and through seed funds provided by the OR and the Baskin School of Engineering to research intelligent transportation.</span><span class="s2"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Frontier projects at the NSF must address clearly identified critical CPS challenges that cannot be achieved by a set of smaller projects,&#8221; Sanfelice said. &#8220;Back in 2017, we founded the UCSC CPSRC with the intention of providing a platform for leading a winning Frontier proposal. I'm thrilled that NSF has selected our proposal for an award and feel privileged to lead this innovative project."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="927b50be807270464be562b5308a4379"><name>ecology-chaos</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Study finds chaos is more common in ecological systems than previously thought</title><summary>The idea that chaos is rare in natural populations may be due to methodological and data limitations, rather than the inherent stability of ecosystems.</summary><keywords>Tanya Rogers</keywords><start-date>1656342000000</start-date><display-name>Study finds chaos is more common in ecological systems than previously thought</display-name><path>/2022/06/ecology-chaos</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/ecology-chaos</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1656019964073</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1656341898375</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Applied Mathematics and Statistics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/population-dynamics-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/population-dynamics-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>population-dynamics-450.jpg</name><display-name>population-dynamics-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>75913</file-size><width>450</width><height>282</height></image><image-alt>graphs of population dynamics</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/06/images/population-dynamics-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/06/images/population-dynamics-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>population-dynamics-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>population-dynamics-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20253</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>graphs of population dynamics</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Chaotic and non-chaotic population dynamics cannot be reliably differentiated by visual inspection of time series.

<p>Populations of organisms in natural ecosystems fluctuate a lot, and a key question for ecologists is whether those fluctuations are regular (varying around some theoretically &#8220;stable&#8221; equilibrium), random (completely unpredictable), or chaotic. Chaotic systems, like the weather, can be predictable in the short term but not in the long term, and they are highly sensitive to small differences in the initial conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowing whether these fluctuations are regular, chaotic, or random has major implications for how well, and how far into the future, we can predict population sizes and how they will respond to management interventions,&#8221; said Tanya Rogers, a NOAA Fisheries ecologist and research fellow at UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences.</p>
<p>Rogers is first author of the new study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01787-y">published June 27 in <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em></a>. Her coauthors are Bethany Johnson, a UCSC graduate student in applied mathematics, and Stephan Munch, a NOAA Fisheries ecologist and adjunct professor at UCSC in the Departments of Applied Mathematics and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.</p>
<p>The researchers found evidence of chaotic dynamics in over 30 percent of the populations they analyzed in an ecological database. Previous meta-analyses assessing the prevalence of chaos in natural field populations had found chaos to be absent or rare. But that may have been due to limited amounts of data and the use of inadequate methods, rather than the inherent stability of ecosystems, the authors said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot more data now, and how long a time series you have makes a big difference for detecting chaotic dynamics,&#8221; Munch said. &#8220;We also showed that methodological assumptions made in prior meta-analyses were biased against detecting chaos.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the new study, the researchers used new and updated chaos detection algorithms and put them through rigorous testing on simulated data sets. Then they applied the three best methods to a dataset of 172 population time series from the Global Population Dynamics Database.</p>
<p>Their analysis revealed interesting associations between chaotic dynamics, lifespan, and body size. Chaos was most prevalent among plankton and insects, least prevalent among birds and mammals, and intermediate among fishes.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of short-lived species tend to have chaotic population dynamics, and these are also species that tend to have boom-and-bust dynamics,&#8221; Rogers said.</p>
<p>The results suggest there may be intrinsic limits to ecological forecasting and caution against the use of equilibrium-based approaches to conservation and management, particularly for short-lived species.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the fisheries management perspective, we want to predict fish populations so we can set limits for fishery harvests,&#8221; Rogers explained. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t recognize the existence of chaos, we could be losing out on short-term forecasting possibilities using methods appropriate for chaotic systems, while being overconfident about our ability to make long-term predictions.&#8221;</p>

<p>We are deeply dismayed by the U.S. Supreme Court opinion issued this morning that revokes the rights of millions of Americans to make private, personal, informed choices about their health care and ultimately their lives.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s opinion in <em>Dobbs v. Jackson</em> overturns the landmark 1973 <em>Roe v. Wade</em> decision, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion that has existed as settled law for nearly 50 years. The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision will lead to near-total bans on abortion procedures in approximately half of the states, and may mean that cases relying on similar reasoning to <em>Roe v. Wade</em> that protect other fundamental rights, from contraception to gay marriage, could be reviewed and overturned.</p>
<p>The implications of overturning <em>Roe</em> are particularly challenging for those marginalized not just by gender, but by race, ethnicity, sexuality, and economic status. This decision intrudes on and in some cases endangers the lives, families, and relationships of all persons. Health-care providers will be criminalized for addressing the medical needs of their patients. Pregnant individuals, including those with disabilities or underlying medical conditions, may be unable to take necessary measures to protect their own health and safety.</p>
<p>We strongly support the right of women and pregnant people to access all necessary health care and to make decisions about their own care in consultation with their medical team. We are grateful that Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state leaders are working to protect reproductive rights in California, and we firmly believe that access to health care and reproductive choice are basic civil rights, regardless of where one lives.</p>
<p>UCSC Student Health Services has long provided students with access to comprehensive reproductive health services, and will continue to do so. We have strong, long-standing referral relationships with community health organizations. A full list of health resources available to those in our campus community can be found on a <a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/ecosystem-of-care/reproductive-health.html">newly created Reproductive Health campus webpage</a>. It includes links to resources available to those grappling with today&#8217;s news.</p>
<p>Today is a difficult day in a decades-long movement to protect and advance human and civil rights for all people. It is not the last day in this struggle, though. We will continue to work and advocate for a more just and equitable future in which individuals are afforded the right to make personal decisions about family, relationships, and bodily autonomy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/> Cindy and Lori</p>

In subsequent years, sea urchin movements enabled kelp forest recovery at sites that had been denuded &#8220;urchin barrens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those are among the key findings of a long-term study of sea urchins and kelp forest dynamics in Monterey Bay conducted by scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.14064">Published June 29 in <em>Ecology Letters</em></a>, the new findings could be helpful in efforts to restore decimated kelp forests along the California coast, said Joshua Smith, who led the study as a Ph.D. student at UCSC and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at UC Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>&#8220;As people are thinking about practical ways to facilitate kelp forest recovery, most people would agree we need to reduce the number of sea urchins, but it&#8217;s also really important to consider the role of sea urchin behavior,&#8221; Smith said.</p>
<p>Smith and coauthor Tim Tinker, an adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, used 22 years of long-term monitoring data to show that the 2014 outbreak of purple sea urchins in southern Monterey Bay was primarily driven by a behavioral shift, not by a population increase.</p>
<p>Over the next three years, they tracked the foraging behavior of sea urchins in the area, which had become a patchy mosaic of kelp forests and urchin barrens. They found that sea urchin behavior was linked to transitions between the two states in both directions.</p>
<h2>Ecosystem disruptions</h2>
<p>A series of major disruptions to California&#8217;s kelp forest ecosystems began in 2013 with the emergence of sea star wasting disease, which wiped out a sea urchin predator, the sunflower sea star. The next year an extraordinary marine heatwave bathed the coast in warm water, creating poor conditions for the growth of kelp. That set the stage for the unprecedented outbreak of sea urchins. All of a sudden, the rocky reefs where kelp forests grew were covered with purple sea urchins grazing on the living kelp.</p>
<p>Normally, Smith explained, sea urchins hide from predators in the cracks and crevices of the rocky reef and feed on kelp detritus that drifts their way on the currents. With reduced kelp productivity due to the warm water, the usual food deliveries weren&#8217;t happening, while at the same time a known sea urchin predator had disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2014, they came storming out of the crevices looking for kelp,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;These were big adult sea urchins that showed up all of a sudden, especially in central and northern California, and that behavioral shift here along the Monterey Peninsula led to these urchin barrens where there had been kelp forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/kelp-forests-monterey.html">previous study</a>, Smith and coauthors showed that sea otters were crucial to maintaining patches of healthy kelp forest in Monterey Bay by preying on sea urchins. In northern California, where there are no sea otters, the kelp forests are almost entirely gone.</p>
<p>In the new study, Smith and Tinker found no evidence of an unusual pulse of juvenile sea urchins increasing the population in 2014. In subsequent years, however, sea urchin &#8220;recruitment&#8221; (the addition of juvenile urchins to the population) did increase, so there are now more sea urchins than there were before 2014, Smith said.</p>
<h2>Recovery</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, the researchers found that kelp forests can recover if sea urchins move off of a reef. In 2018, for example, they went out to a site that had been an urchin barren the previous year and found a kelp forest. The sea urchins had moved away from the reef, which they had stripped of kelp, into shallower water where there was an abundance of red foliose algae.</p>
<p>&#8220;They prefer kelp, but they had eaten all the kelp, so they moved up into shallower water and that allowed the kelp to regrow on the deeper reef,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;Interestingly, the kelp that came back was bull kelp, not the giant kelp that is typically dominant on the central coast.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that water conditions this year are excellent for kelp growth. An unusually windy spring has driven strong upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water along the coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all waiting to see how that impacts kelp recovery,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;There are just a lot more sea urchins now out on the reefs actively grazing, so we need to consider how we might get their numbers back down and enough predation to drive them back into the crevices.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to strengthen and streamline our organization, the Office of Audit and Management Advisory Services (AMAS) will report to the Chancellor&#8217;s Office effective July 1.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having our internal audit office report to the Chancellor&#8217;s Office ensures that it is an integral and integrated part of the university&#8217;s shared governance structure. This reporting relationship also solidifies the role that internal audit has in providing a critical assessment, monitoring and consultative role in assisting the chancellor and senior leaders in the discharge of their oversight, management and operating responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Chancellor Anna Finn will remain our Campus Ethics and Compliance Officer (CECO) and will work closely with AMAS Director James Dougherty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reestablishing this alignment of the UCSC CECO responsibilities with internal audit leverages the responsibility that the CECO holds for the development of the campus-specific compliance work plan and oversight for its implementation.&#160;</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Committee on Teaching is delighted to announce the 8 recipients of this prestigious campus-wide award from all five divisions for the 2021-22 academic year. Annually, the committee receives<span>&#160; </span>approximately 400 student nominations and selects 7-10 instructors. The student comments about the impact their excellent pedagogical practices have had on their lives were inspiring for COT to read. COT<span>&#160; </span>appreciates their contribution to the important mission of teaching on our campus and is grateful for the opportunity to showcase their accomplishments.&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>micha c&#225;rdenas, Associate Professor, Arts, Games and Playable Media</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;micha was overwhelmingly gracious and compassionate to me as a student. she started each class by empowering us and encouraging a class of mostly trans students and students of color to take up space, to be vulnerable with another, and to be receptive of each other's critique, care, and guidance. micha made us all feel as though that the time we shared in our seminar belonged to each other and what we were able to offer each other in that time was precious. micha, through this class, made me feel like i have something more to give to myself and my community. in class, we "rehearsed for the revolution" and experimented and exercised a world that gave trans people of color more. we had the opportunity to return our agency to ourselves. micha encouraged our seminar to return to our power, and she is absolutely deserving of the highest praise.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>David Draper, Professor, Statistics</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I loved how professor draper was able to connect concepts that were very abstract to real world happenings. If there was something in the news that someone found that mentioned statistics or something we had gone over, he would spend at lengths engaging with the topic. He was always available to answer questions and went far beyond what any other teacher I have had in terms of helping students. He made sure to cover every element in tests and quizzes. During a time of zoom university burn out, he kept me engaged and going to watch his lectures. You can see his passion in his subject and his desire for us as students to succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Elena Finkbeiner, Adjunct Faculty, Coastal Science and Policy</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Elena's classes were by far the highlight of last quarter, and I can say from many conversations that my classmates and I looked forward to her lectures every week. Tasked with covering the broad discipline of &#8220;social sciences,&#8221; she did an excellent job providing a breadth of knowledge, while also allowing us to dig deep into the intricacies and complexities of being a social science researcher in conservation. Her own background in this field, combined with her obvious passion for advancing interdisciplinary social science, made class even more enjoyable, as we were able to witness the ways the concepts we were learning about could be interrogated, adapted, and applied to different conservation scenarios. In addition to being extremely knowledgeable, Elena is one of the kindest people I&#8217;ve ever met, and her welcoming and joyous personality created a classroom environment where I felt comfortable sharing my opinions, engaging in discussions, and asking questions (this cannot be said of every class I&#8217;ve been in). I left Elena&#8217;s class with not only foundational knowledge in social sciences, but a new perspective on the work I&#8217;m planning to do in the future. I mean this with no exaggeration when I say that Elena is an inspiration, and because of her I will strive to continue learning and improving as an interdisciplinary scientist.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Kyle Robertson, Continuing Lecturer, Philosophy<span>&#160;</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kyle is one of the most amazing professors I have ever had. Before I took ethics bowl I was unsure what I wanted to do once I left school and where I wanted to go. Kyle&#8217;s class put me on the track I&#8217;m on now. I fell in love with ethics because of this class and the way he taught. So much so that I went and joined the ethics bowl team and am joining again in the fall. Kyle is an amazing professor, coach and mentor.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Brenda Sanfilippo, Continuing Lecturer, Writing Program<span>&#160;</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The teacher made an excellent job turning what could have been an impersonal, online course into an online classroom by making videos where she showed her face, having class discussion boards and having required zoom meetings. This made the class feel more interactive. Moreover, feedback was very well developed on every single assignment, which made students feel supported and showed instructor cared about their learning.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Gina Athena Ulysse, Professor, Feminist Studies<span>&#160;</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Professor was very engaging with the class and was also very understanding. She let us engage with the material in numerous different ways such as artistic representation readings, videos, lectures and she asked broad philosophical questions that we would revisit throughout the quarter. She taught me a lot about the history of black feminism and how not much has change throughout the history of black feminist movements. She even used her own research to express these ideas of how vast they really can be as well as the Ted talk she gave which was very moving. I absolutely loved taking the class and if I could I would take more classes from her but this is my last quarter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Peter Weiss,<span>&#160; </span>Continuing Lecturer, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ron Ruby Award Recipient</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Peter Weiss showed a lot of passion both towards chemistry as a subject (thus increasing my engagement) and towards actually teaching that chemistry to students. His course was clear in expectations and had multiple ways I could access to enhance learning, and has been one of my most enjoyable experiences with chemistry. His use of online resources (WebAssign) felt actually integrated into the course for actual understanding rather than offloading work. His class made me feel actually prepared for OChem and was part of my decision in deciding to continue in a major that required it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Daniel Wirls, Professor, Politics</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Professor Wirls always made sure that every single person in class felt supported and really helped us understand that he was more interested in making sure we succeeded in his class than trying to make things purposely tricky or complex. It was really evident that he cared about all of his students and if they comprehended the course content. He was always willing to give advice, tell anecdotes about his time in the political sphere, and answer any questions we had about his lectures.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jody Greene, Associate Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning and Michael Tassio, Director of Online Education, were also presented </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with an Distinguished Achievement Award for the wisdom, agility, and tireless efforts in guiding the UC Santa Cruz community to &#8220;keep learning and keep teaching&#8221; during the COVID-19 pandemic. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Committee on Teaching is delighted to announce the 8 recipients of this prestigious campus-wide award from all five divisions for the 2021-22 academic year. Annually, the committee receives&#160; approximately 400 student nominations and selects 7-10 instructors. The student comments about the impact their excellent pedagogical practices have had on their lives were inspiring for COT to read. COT&#160; appreciates their contribution to the important mission of teaching on our campus and is grateful for the opportunity to showcase their accomplishments.</span></p>
<p><strong>micha c&#225;rdenas, Associate Professor, Arts, Games and Playable Media&#160;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;micha was overwhelmingly gracious and compassionate to me as a student. she started each class by empowering us and encouraging a class of mostly trans students and students of color to take up space, to be vulnerable with another, and to be receptive of each other's critique, care, and guidance. micha made us all feel as though that the time we shared in our seminar belonged to each other and what we were able to offer each other in that time was precious. micha, through this class, made me feel like i have something more to give to myself and my community. in class, we "rehearsed for the revolution" and experimented and exercised a world that gave trans people of color more. we had the opportunity to return our agency to ourselves. micha encouraged our seminar to return to our power, and she is absolutely deserving of the highest praise.&#8221;&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>David Draper, Professor, Statistics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I loved how professor draper was able to connect concepts that were very abstract to real world happenings. If there was something in the news that someone found that mentioned statistics or something we had gone over, he would spend at lengths engaging with the topic. He was always available to answer questions and went far beyond what any other teacher I have had in terms of helping students. He made sure to cover every element in tests and quizzes. During a time of zoom university burn out, he kept me engaged and going to watch his lectures. You can see his passion in his subject and his desire for us as students to succeed.&#8221;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Elena Finkbeiner, Adjunct Faculty, Coastal Science and Policy&#160;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Elena's classes were by far the highlight of last quarter, and I can say from many conversations that my classmates and I looked forward to her lectures every week. Tasked with covering the broad discipline of &#8220;social sciences,&#8221; she did an excellent job providing a breadth of knowledge, while also allowing us to dig deep into the intricacies and complexities of being a social science researcher in conservation. Her own background in this field, combined with her obvious passion for advancing interdisciplinary social science, made class even more enjoyable, as we were able to witness the ways the concepts we were learning about could be interrogated, adapted, and applied to different conservation scenarios. In addition to being extremely knowledgeable, Elena is one of the kindest people I&#8217;ve ever met, and her welcoming and joyous personality created a classroom environment where I felt comfortable sharing my opinions, engaging in discussions, and asking questions (this cannot be said of every class I&#8217;ve been in). I left Elena&#8217;s class with not only foundational knowledge in social sciences, but a new perspective on the work I&#8217;m planning to do in the future. I mean this with no exaggeration when I say that Elena is an inspiration, and because of her I will strive to continue learning and improving as an interdisciplinary scientist.&#8221;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kyle Robertson, Continuing Lecturer, Philosophy&#160;&#160;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kyle is one of the most amazing professors I have ever had. Before I took ethics bowl I was unsure what I wanted to do once I left school and where I wanted to go. Kyle&#8217;s class put me on the track I&#8217;m on now. I fell in love with ethics because of this class and the way he taught. So much so that I went and joined the ethics bowl team and am joining again in the fall. Kyle is an amazing professor, coach and mentor.&#8221;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brenda Sanfilippo, Continuing Lecturer, Writing Program&#160;&#160;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The teacher made an excellent job turning what could have been an impersonal, online course into an online classroom by making videos where she showed her face, having class discussion boards and having required zoom meetings. This made the class feel more interactive. Moreover, feedback was very well developed on every single assignment, which made students feel supported and showed instructor cared about their learning.&#8221;&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gina Athena Ulysse, Professor, Feminist Studies&#160;&#160;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Professor was very engaging with the class and was also very understanding. She let us engage with the material in numerous different ways such as artistic representation readings, videos, lectures and she asked broad philosophical questions that we would revisit throughout the quarter. She taught me a lot about the history of black feminism and how not much has change throughout the history of&#160; black feminist movements. She even used her own research to express these ideas of how vast they really can be as well as the Ted talk she gave which was very moving. I absolutely loved taking the class and if I could I would take more classes from her but this is my last quarter.&#8221;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Peter Weiss,&#160; Continuing Lecturer, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ron Ruby Award Recipient</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Peter Weiss showed a lot of passion both towards chemistry as a subject (thus increasing my engagement) and towards actually teaching that chemistry to students. His course was clear in expectations and had multiple ways I could access to enhance learning, and has been one of my most enjoyable experiences with chemistry. His use of online resources (WebAssign) felt actually integrated into the course for actual understanding rather than offloading work. His class made me feel actually prepared for OChem and was part of my decision in deciding to continue in a major that required it."&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Daniel Wirls, Professor, Politics&#160;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Professor Wirls always made sure that every single person in class felt supported and really helped us understand that he was more interested in making sure we succeeded in his class than trying to make things purposely tricky or complex. It was really evident that he cared about all of his students and if they comprehended the course content. He was always willing to give advice, tell anecdotes about his time in the political sphere, and answer any questions we had about his lectures. His lectures would always be edited just before class started to make sure they were as accurate as possible, as well as easy to understand. He made the class accessible and engaging by providing course materials for free and starting each lecture off with music, a clever introduction to whichever political figure or time period we would focus on. Professor Wirls truly cares about the subject and the students at UCSC and deserves to be recognized for the hard work he puts into improving his course and his students."</span></li>

leaders</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 12 years, Nathaniel Deutsch will step down from his role as Faculty Director of The Humanities Institute (THI) at UC Santa Cruz at the end of the 2021-22 academic year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Deutsch has held the position since 2010, when it was known as the Institute for Humanities Research. During his tenure, THI has mounted hundreds of public programs, supported nearly 1,000 faculty and student fellows, incubated new research projects, and worked with faculty across campus to raise more than $10 million in extramural funds for humanities research &#8212; all accomplishments for which Deutsch insists he deserves only partial credit.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been really lucky to have worked with an amazing team over the years, especially Irena Poli&#263;, Managing Director of THI,&#8221; Deutsch said. &#8220;That&#8217;s something I benefited from tremendously. We built a team of staff and students that is going to outlast me, and that&#8217;s really strong. I think everyone that works with us gets that impression as well.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chancellor Cynthia Larive lauded Deutsch&#8217;s leadership and noted THI's growth over the past decade. &#8220;THI has emerged as a powerful hub for our campus and in the greater community, fostering new directions in research, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and public engagement,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;We have an excellent foundation to continue to build faculty research and experiential learning opportunities for our students in the coming years.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deutsch took on the role of Faculty Director after serving in a similar role as Chair of the Humanities at Swarthmore College and as Director for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Center for Jewish Studies. &#8220;Taking the helm of this new institute was a natural fit,&#8221; he said, and a chance to &#8220;start to build something.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I remember thinking at the time that there was a lot of opportunity in different areas of the humanities to do things and to serve the community,&#8221; Deutsch added. &#8220;I think we did a good job of showing the breadth of the humanities, the depth that people who work in the humanities can engage with really important questions and do research and how that research informed both their teaching and in public engagement.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irena Poli&#263;, Managing Director of THI, describes their partnership as an opportunity of a lifetime.&#160; &#8220;Working with Nathaniel over the last 12 years to build THI, to design an institute which is simultaneously a powerful research hub with an international reputation and an important part of our community, has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. Nathaniel&#8217;s generosity of spirit has carried forward in everything we do, and allowed THI to serve as an intellectual home for anyone at UC Santa Cruz who considers themselves a humanist, regardless of which department or division they are associated with.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deutsch will continue to be a part of UC Santa Cruz and the larger THI community. He will carry on as a professor of history and director of the Center for Jewish Studies, which is housed in THI. While his leadership will be missed, there is also a lot of excitement about the people who are joining the team. Pranav Anand, professor and outgoing chair of the Linguistics Department at UC Santa Cruz, will be THI&#8217;s new Faculty Director.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anand has already made a sizable impact at UCSC since arriving at the school in 2006. Working at the intersection of linguistics, philosophy, and computational modeling, Anand&#8217;s research primarily focuses on cross-linguistic variations in context-dependent meaning. In 2016, he was awarded the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/06/humanities-awards-celebration.html">John Dizikes Teaching Award in Humanities</a>, and earlier this year served as co-principal investigator on a proposal that helped the university receive a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/01/neh-grant-humanities-engineering.html">National Endowment for the Humanities grant</a> to create a certificate program for engineering students to better understand the impact of technology on the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For me, The Humanities Institute is a model for what innovative, imaginative research and engagement in the humanities looks like,&#8221; said Anand. &#8220;In my research, teaching, and service, I have looked to THI for both advice and inspiration in how to engage with students and the community, and how to pursue interdisciplinary work. Many conversations I have had with THI staff and faculty that were ostensibly about increasing the legibility of my work have invariably turned into richer and deeper examinations of the work, always unearthing new territory for exploration. The chance to be part of the team that figures out what new initiatives THI takes on, and to have a similar kind impact for others, is incredibly exciting.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Anand is looking forward to getting started in this new position, he won&#8217;t officially begin his tenure as Faculty Director until 2023 as he is going on sabbatical for a year, during which time he will be working on the perspectival dimensions and evidential restrictions in questions and expressions of taste. To help assist in the transition, professor of literature Sharon Kinoshita, current member of the THI Steering Committee, will serve as Interim Director.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinoshita has been a member of the UC Santa Cruz faculty since 1987, focusing on Medieval French, Mediterranean, and Global Studies in the Literature Department. She serves as co-director for the UCSC Center for Mediterranean Studies and co-director of The Mediterranean Seminar, and has received numerous grants and awards over the years, including a UC President's Fellowship in 2012 and, in 2007, an honorable mention prize from the Modern Language Association of American for her book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medieval Boundaries: Rethinking Difference in Old French Literature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, published by the University of Pennsylvania Press.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deutsch couldn&#8217;t be more thrilled with the new leadership choices at THI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Both of them are really excellent scholars, respected not only in their division, but more broadly in the university and internationally,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They have wide ranging intellects. They can engage with faculty and students and look at their projects from a number of different fields. And will have the intelligence to share in those kinds of conversations whether they&#8217;re public or that can occur in a position where a faculty member might want you to take a look at their grant proposal. They have a lot of integrity and both are going to do great jobs.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poli&#263; wholeheartedly agrees and is excited about the future. &#8220;Sharon and Pranav have been deeply engaged with THI over the last decade, as scholars, research project directors, and steering committee members. I look forward to working with them, as well as with Humanities Dean, Jasmine Alinder, to continue to further our Divisional goals.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nathaniel, Irena, and the entire THI team have created one of the most impactful humanities institutes in the country,&#8221; said Alinder. &#8220;Through their programs, we are able to engage thousands of community members, support student internships, and incubate faculty research. Under their leadership, THI has become a model humanities center. I am excited for what will come from the new leadership of Sharon and Pranav; both are innovative scholars who are highly engaged with our students and faculty. THI is in excellent hands."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ac37f5c5807270464be562b51d64d769"><name>online-echo-chambers</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>These red flags can let you know when you’re in an online echo chamber</title><summary>Researchers at UC Santa Cruz have identified specific elements of tone and style in online speech that are linked to hyperpartisan echo chambers.

The findings are now published in the journal </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F09579265221108022"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discourse &amp; Society</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online echo chambers are virtual spaces that gather like-minded individuals. Prior research has shown that people are more likely to believe and share information they encounter in these spaces, because it confirms their existing beliefs. Echo chambers are also an ideal venue for hyperpartisanship, or rigid political ideology that shows a strong bias toward one perspective, while attacking another.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyperpartisan communication is not objective or necessarily rooted in fact, and research has found that some social media users who routinely engage in this style of communication also spread disinformation: content that is intentionally deceptive.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hyperpartisan communication is related to what we call &#8216;alternative reality communication,&#8217;&#8221; explained Psychology Professor Jean E. Fox Tree, senior author of the new paper. &#8220;Examples include things like urban legends, disinformation, fake news, and any type of information that is overblown in various ways. It's important to understand why this type of information gains so much traction, and one theory is there&#8217;s a shared style of communication that&#8217;s part of that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, alternative reality communication has previously been shown to feature aspects like strong emotion and display of in-group status that are believed to contribute to its rapid spread. This made the research team wonder if linguistic markers of spontaneous communication could reliably indicate that a space is a hyperpartisan echo chamber. Spontaneous communication is an off-the-cuff style of speech that includes informality, familiarity, and strong emotion, rather than careful composition.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People use spontaneous communication in order to create a sense of personal closeness, and that can lead to increased uptake in information,&#8221; said Cognitive Psychology Ph.D. candidate Allison Nguyen, lead author of the new study.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To look for evidence of this style of communication in hyperpartisan spaces, researchers analyzed 47,112 comments on Reddit within eight political subreddits. Four were non-hyperpartisan, with stated intentions of facilitating discussion among people with differing viewpoints or more moderate political views. The other four were classified as hyperpartisan, because they catered to specific political viewpoints that were far from center. Two of those were on the right, and two were on the left.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analysis showed that elements of spontaneous communication that convey strong emotion, like swear words and exclamation marks, were good predictors of hyperpartisan echo chambers, as were &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;you&#8221; pronouns, which convey familiarity. There was also a strong link with elements that mimic the feeling of face-to-face conversation, including discourse markers, like &#8220;oh,&#8221; &#8220;well,&#8221; and &#8220;you know,&#8221; which direct the flow of conversation, and prepositions, like &#8220;with,&#8221; &#8220;in,&#8221; and &#8220;during,&#8221; that convey a sense of space and time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-hyperpartisan subreddits, on the other hand, used a very different style of communication. Those virtual spaces emphasized third-person pronouns, periods as the primary form of punctuation, and use of quotations. The research team suspects these language features may be used to convey a distanced, neutral approach, with a focus on evidence and precision.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pronounced difference between the common use of spontaneous communication elements in hyperpartisan comments and the relative lack of these features on non-hyperpartisan spaces suggests that they could be used to identify hyperpartisan echo chambers. And because hyperpartisan communication has been associated with disinformation, these language markers could also prove useful for flagging spaces where disinformation may be likely to emerge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of people get their news from spaces on the internet, and maybe this research can help people learn how to spot whether they're in some sort of echo chamber or bubble online,&#8221; Nguyen said. &#8220;Knowing what to look for and which spaces to be wary in is really important in how we can prevent the spread of disinformation.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b129e2c7807270464be562b542276308"><name>representation-for-autistic-adults</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Autistic adults have become increasingly visible in media, books, television, and more in the past decade, but challenges with representation persist</title><summary>Researchers documented a shift toward more numerical representation for adults in popular portrayals of autism, which have historically focused on children.  &#13;

The study, published in the journal </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/aut.2022.0014"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autism in Adulthood</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, follows up on a </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.18061/dsq.v31i3.1675"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2011 paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, &#8220;Infantilizing Autism,&#8221; in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disability Studies Quarterly,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which had found that popular portrayals of autism were overwhelmingly focused on children.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The earlier paper had raised alarm about lack of representation of adults with autism, which can limit public awareness of the unique needs of some autistic adults, like employment and housing accomodations. At the time, the authors of the 2011 paper&#8212;Jennifer L. Stevenson, Bev Harp, and Morton Ann Gernsbacher&#8212;theorized that the bias toward representing children might be due to factors like advocacy organizations being led by parents and clinicians and a predominant focus on initial diagnosis and treatment of autism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, since then, the neurodiversity movement has continued to grow, especially as autistic self-advocates have worked to shift focus onto how autistic people can flourish throughout their lives. And a new team of researchers, led by UC Santa Cruz Psychology Professor Nameera Akhtar, wondered whether these efforts, and other potential influences, may have affected representations of autism over the past decade. So, they set out to replicate the 2011 study.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is an important issue to track, because autistic adults often say it&#8217;s very annoying to them that autism is almost always depicted as having to do with children, and it's like that is making them invisible,&#8221; Akhtar said. &#8220;They talk about how it&#8217;s like they fall off a cliff when they turn 18, because there are very few resources available for them after that. But, of course, you don't stop being autistic and needing accommodations when you become an adult.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see how trends in representation may have changed, one place the research team looked was the websites of some well-known autism advocacy and charity organizations. In reviewing the homepages of 49 state and regional chapters of the Autism Society of America in 2019, the team found that 20% of photographs depicting autistic individuals were of adults, compared to only 5% of photos when the 2011 study had originally conducted a similar review. While children were still heavily favored, this was a statistically significant improvement. And 80% of websites at least mentioned autistic adults and linked to related resources. A review of 16 additional autism charity organization websites found similar results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study also looked for trends across the entertainment industry. Researchers analyzed 124 movies and television shows released between 2010 and 2019 that featured autistic characters. They found that 58% of these characters were children, whereas 68% of autistic characters were children in the 2011 paper&#8217;s original analysis. The new paper says one factor that could be contributing to this improvement is that production teams are increasingly bringing in consultants to advise on proposed portrayals of autism&#8212;likely due to calls for more accurate representation from autistic self-advocates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, levels of representation were quite different in the publishing industry. The research team reviewed 484 English-language fiction books published between 2010 and 2017 that included a mention of an autistic character in the book&#8217;s description. 81% of these characters were children, compared to the 91% at the time of the 2011 paper&#8217;s analysis. This was a statistically significant improvement, despite the lingering disparity. The new paper conducted an additional analysis showing that representation was better among books geared toward adult audiences, in which 67% of autistic characters were children.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team also analyzed 90 news stories from print, television, and radio media outlets in the United States that featured one autistic individual and were published between April and May of 2020. 58% of these stories featured autistic children, compared to 79% of stories in a similar analysis for the initial study.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the new paper notes that even though autistic adults are increasingly represented in news media, they may still be portrayed as childlike. For example, the study showed that one-third of news stories that included autistic adults also mentioned their parents. And </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09687599.2020.1751073"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prior research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has found that non-autistic researchers, parents, and clinicians are more likely to be presented as experts on autism than are autistic adults themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the authors of the new study say that, while their findings show a shift toward more numerical representation for adults in portrayals of autism, there&#8217;s still plenty of room for improvement, including in the capacity of those representations to truly reflect the lived experiences of autistic adults. UCSC Associate Professor of Philosophy Janette Dinishak, a coauthor of the new paper, says she hopes future improvements in representation might include increased attention to the intersectionality of autism with gender, race, ethnicity, and other social categories or identities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need to see a continued increase in the number of representations of autistic adults, along with an improvement in the manner of that representation to reflect the heterogeneity of how autism manifests across a person&#8217;s lifespan,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Autistic people need to be part of the conversation on how to improve that representation, and they also need to be given space to represent themselves.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="c9ec477e807270462612537cdef451ab"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>June</title><start-date>1654070400000</start-date><display-name>June</display-name><path>/2022/06/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/06/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1639770244981</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1641091179644</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
