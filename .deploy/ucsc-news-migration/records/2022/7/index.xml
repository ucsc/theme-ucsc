machine learning methods have enabled major advances in analyzing big data, but the current state-of-the-art technology is not suited for the intricacies&#160; of surveys that use complex sampling methods. With the support of a three-year, $337,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, Assistant Professor of Statistics Paul Parker will develop statistical and machine learning methods to best suit the analysis of complex surveys produced by federal statistics agencies.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We're currently in this data science and machine learning revolution, where there's all these new methods that can analyze these massive datasets and do so very well, but they're not necessarily able to be used off the shelf for these types of survey datasets,&#8221; Parker said. &#8220;That's because they typically assume a simple random sample from the population, which is not the case with these types of surveys.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This project will focus on a group of surveys produced by the <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/">National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics</a> (NCSES), such as the National Survey of College Graduates and the Survey of Earned Doctorates, which help inform important official population estimates. Instead of sampling a population with equal probability, these surveys and other federal surveys typically over or undersample from particular groups.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Parker will create statistical methods for machine learning models that are specifically designed to account for survey design, the unique way in which data is collected. He aims to take advantage of machine learning technology&#8217;s ability to create flexible data models that can often improve precision of population estimates.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, many machine learning models are often not equipped to provide important estimates of uncertainty in datasets, a shortcoming which Parker will address through the frameworks he develops.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;[The project addresses] two things: accounting for the survey design, but also incorporating it into a statistical framework to generate those uncertainty estimates,&#8221; Parker said. &#8220;I think those are the two areas where our expertise will help to improve these models.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These new methods will benefit agencies tasked with producing population estimates from NCSES surveys, who Parker says are increasingly faced with a combination of limited resources and higher expectations for their work. The improved estimates will also be useful for people who interpret and make policy or funding decisions based on the data produced.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ultimately, Parker hopes that these methods will have broader applicability to other federal statistical agencies as well as fields such as economics and sociology that deal with dependent survey datasets.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This project is funded through the NSF&#8217;s National Center For Science and Engineering Statistics and will be a collaborative effort with principal investigator Scott Holan at the University of Missouri.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d0b5ece7807270460992605bc3dcfbeb"><name>ca-conservation-genomics</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC scholars join researchers statewide on a massive genomic study of California’s biodiversity</title><summary>The California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP) is a state-funded initiative with a single goal: to produce the most comprehensive, multispecies genomic dataset ever assembled to help manage regional biodiversity. </summary><start-date>1657123200000</start-date><path>/2022/07/ca-conservation-genomics</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/07/ca-conservation-genomics</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1657063992513</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1657135806658</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/bear350.png</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/bear350.png</link><site>news</site><name>bear350.png</name><display-name>bear350.png</display-name><file-size>146337</file-size><width>350</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt>A black bear standing in a stream.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/bear801.png</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/bear801.png</link><site>news</site><name>bear801.png</name><display-name>bear80.png</display-name><file-size>15517</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>A black bear standing in a stream.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The black bear's genome surprised postdoc Merly Escalona because of how relatively easy it was to assemble.

For a small invertebrate, this California native spider&#8217;s genetic code was very fragmented and consisted of about four billion bases (four gigabases) &#8211; larger than the human genome&#8217;s size of a little more than three gigabases.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There have been lots of other surprising discoveries as Escalona works to assemble 150 different high quality reference genomes, each of which comprises a detailed map of the genetic material of a species, in her role on the scientific team for the <a href="https://www.ccgproject.org/"><span class="s2">California Conservation Genomics Project</span></a> (CCGP). This $12 million state-funded project aims to create a comprehensive genomic dataset representative of the state&#8217;s biodiversity, as outlined by a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jhered/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jhered/esac020/6565646#supplementary-data"><span class="s2">recent paper in the Journal of Heredity</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The CCGP, launched in 2019, is led by Director Brad Shaffer at UC Los Angeles and involves researchers from the University of California, California State Universities, and officials from state and federal regulatory agencies and non-governmental organizations. The leadership has been consistently working with state officials to make sure the results can be an invaluable and lasting resource for shaping conservation policy.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We are generating very high quality data that will be a lasting resource for this project and will form a foundation for future conservation actions,&#8221; Shaffer said.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Collaborating for conservation</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Escalona is just one of 15 researchers at UCSC working on the project. She is on the leadership team alongside faculty such as Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Beth Shapiro, who is on both the Scientific Executive Committee and the Technical Committee for the project, and Associate Professor of Biomolecular Engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering Russell Corbett Detig, who is the project&#8217;s bioinformatics lead. Both researchers are also on the leadership team at the UCSC Genomics Institute.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The project is the first of its kind in terms of scale in the field of conservation genomics. Researchers are studying a range of species to get an idea of the genetic biodiversity that exists across the state, from the mountain lions and the deer they hunt amidst the redwoods to the surfgrasses that sway in tide pools along the coast.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The north to the south of California spans all sorts of ecosystem diversity in a way that is unique to the state,&#8221; Shapiro said. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t many contiguous governed bodies that span this much ecological diversity. This is really an opportunity to capture how ecological diversity is partitioned across so many different ecosystems.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This work was presented with significant challenges by the surge in natural disasters affecting the world in recent years. Wildfires and droughts in the state spurred by climate change made it difficult to access some plant samples necessary to assemble genomic data. The pandemic slowed lab and field work and extended the timeline of the CCGP from three to four years.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite these setbacks, the CCGP is continuing with its data collection phase, which includes both reference genomes and resequencing many individuals of each species. The reference genome phase of the project is nearing completion, with virtually all tissues in hand, most in the data acquisition and analysis pipelines, nearly a third fully assembled, and about a quarter already available on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"><span class="s2">National Center for Biotechnology Information</span></a>&#8217;s open source library of genomic data. The process of resequencing, generating data from more than 100 individuals from each species under study, is now well underway and moving into high gear.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Escalona&#8217;s <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jhered/search-results?f_Authors=Merly+Escalona"><span class="s2">reference genomes</span></a> will serve as a point of comparison to study genetic diversity within a species. In addition, the CCGP will resequence 100-150 additional genomes for each species, which they will study by comparison to the high-quality reference genome. By mapping the variations that occur in these genomes, researchers will discover how much genetic diversity exists in each species and how this diversity is distributed geographically throughout the state.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This information will be used to identify which natural habitats should be prioritized for protection and create a snapshot in time of genomic biodiversity in the state as it exists now, an important reference point as the natural world is impacted by climate change.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In generating both reference genomes and the resequenced genomes, the CCGP project is considerably larger in scale than other projects in conservation genomics. Data sets of this size are scarcely seen outside of human genomics, where biomedical funding can back such computationally intensive projects. In the end, between reference genomes and resequencing, about 22,000 genomes will be sequenced, a feat that speaks to both the recent advancements in genomics technology and the dedication of the researchers involved.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>UC Santa Cruz contributions</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Principal investigators will use the genomic data to study each individual species from the project to understand these creatures, many of which are unique to California. For example, Assistant Adjunct Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Rachel Meyers is leading research into endangered vernal pool grasses, while Associate Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Christopher Vollmers is fittingly studying banana slugs.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the study of these native species may open more questions than it answers. As Escalona works in the UCSC Paleogenomics Lab led by Professors Shapiro and Richard (Ed) Green, she says she is constantly surprised by the genomic mysteries that exist in California&#8217;s nature, such as the huge size of the trapdoor spider&#8217;s genome, or how relatively easy it was to assemble the black bear&#8217;s genome.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It kind of just blows your mind how different [the genomes of species] can be, even closely related species,&#8221; Escalona said. &#8220;Having these reference genomes is a big resource for us to give to the community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The comparison of the geographic distribution of biodiversity across the state will be made possible by the bioinformatics data analysis and processing taken on by Corbett-Detig as well as UCSC bioinformatics postdoc Erik Enbody and data wrangler Cade Mirchandani. Corbett-Detig&#8217;s group is working to make sure that the data from all 150 resequenced genomes within a species are standardized and uniform to make them as comparable as possible.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As this bioinformatics team works on variant calling, the process of comparing the reference genome to the resequenced data to see where the genetic material varies, the massive size of the data presents the most significant challenges, Corbett-Detig noted.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It's uncommonly large,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Especially for conservation genomics, it&#8217;s a vast dataset with incredible potential.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Future impact</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once all of the genomic data has been collected, assembled, and made uniform, analyses and landscape genomics work will begin. Led by UC Berkeley Associate Professor Ian Wang and postdoctoral researcher Anne Changers, the researchers will map out habitat areas that are shown to be particularly vulnerable, in order to better protect them through conservation policy, and identify which populations are the most resilient based on their genetic variation. All of the results will be made publicly available, and the team will work with stakeholders including state and federal regulatory agencies and nonprofits to develop habitat management policy recommendations.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The researchers hope the CCGP can serve as a model to other regions that might want to take on their own studies of genetic biodiversity. California is well-positioned to lead this charge due to both the range of wildlife it is home to and the environmental ethic of its people.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They also want this research to be a springboard for a sustained effort to understand biodiversity in the state, with more work done to understand the success of future interventions that come from this project. But for now, they are happy with the progress being made.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fulbright Program is the United States government&#8217;s flagship international educational exchange program, awarding grants in over 150 countries to fund up to 12 months of international experience including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">independent research, graduate study, and English teaching</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucia Vitale, a PhD candidate in the Department of Politics, will use her award to cover 10 months of fieldwork in the Dominican Republic and Haiti for her dissertation project entitled &#8220;The Borders of Health Citizenship: Multiscalar Inclusion and Exclusion along the Dominican-Haitian Border.&#8221; Vitale&#8217;s work is interested in healthcare access in the Global South, specifically the ways that people are included in or excluded from health services as they navigate a fragmented mix of state and non-state health services, including the numerous charity health programs operated by transnational organizations. Vitale refers to the political relationships through which health rights are endowed as &#8216;Health Citizenship.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitale&#8217;s work </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brings into closer conversation three distinct fields of literature&#8212;global health, social policy, and citizenship&#8212;in order to better understand and comment on how health services are defined at national and transnational scales, and the important ways that these definitions land locally to shape the everyday healthcare experiences of individuals in countries of the Global South.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She credits the interdisciplinary nature of her education at UCSC for shaping her project. &#8220;I&#8217;m so grateful to the Politics Department at UCSC and the way it teaches us why an interdisciplinary approach is important,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It allows you to ask different kinds of questions as compared to a more disciplinary approach.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitale, who had earlier served in the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic, is excited to head to its border with Haiti this fall. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be wonderful to return to a place I care about and to be able to observe closely the local scale health politics that my project is so interested in.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Vitale, this opportunity also comes with great responsibility as a researcher. &#8220;It&#8217;s crucial to maintain a critical awareness of your positionality while you&#8217;re in the field,&#8221; she explains. &#8220;You have to recognize the assumptions or biases that you bring along with you. Thinking constantly about the ethics of your research is the most important part of any investigatory social science project.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catherine Ries, a Visual Studies PhD candidate in the History of Art and Visual Culture Department, was also offered a Fulbright award for her dissertation project, &#8220;Facets of the Feminine: Portraits of Javanese Women, Material Culture, and Islam,&#8221; which investigates how gender and religious ideologies in Java are represented or made manifest through historical portraits, contemporary arts, and visual culture.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ries writes in a project synopsis, &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A plethora of writings have already established the role masculinity plays in Javanese culture and the effects of colonialism in defining maleness. However, less thoroughly considered is the topic of the feminine in the Javanese context. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local understanding of women's visual representations remains under-theorized, especially vis-a-vis changes in light of Islamization.&#8221;</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d469f17d807270460992605ba970b826"><name>narwhals-noise-response</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Narwhals show physiological disruption in response to seismic survey ship noise</title><summary>Scientists deployed monitoring devices on narwhals to record heart rates, breathing, and diving behavior during seismic air gun pulses from a ship in the fjords of Greenland.</summary><keywords>Terrie Williams</keywords><start-date>1657263600000</start-date><display-name>Narwhals show physiological disruption in response to seismic survey ship noise</display-name><path>/2022/07/narwhals-noise-response</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/07/narwhals-noise-response</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1657126121826</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1657290129165</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/narwhal-release-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/narwhal-release-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>narwhal-release-500.jpg</name><display-name>narwhal-release-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>54932</file-size><width>500</width><height>368</height></image><image-alt>narwhal released after tagging</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/narwhal-tusk-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/narwhal-tusk-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>narwhal-tusk-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>narwhal-tusk-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18350</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>large male narwhal at surface</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>In this drone image, researchers in the water watch as a narwhal swims away with a physiological monitoring tag (yellow instrument attached with suction cups on the back), which will record heart rate, breathing rate, stroking frequency, and depth for 1-3 days.

The overall effect is a large increase in the energetic cost of diving while a paradoxically reduced heart rate alters the circulation of blood and oxygen.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re swimming as hard as they can to get away, and yet their heart rate is not increasing&#8212;we think because of a fear response. This affects how much blood and oxygen can circulate, and that&#8217;s going to be problematic,&#8221; said Terrie Williams, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz who led the new study.</p>
<p><a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2435.14119">Published July 8 in the <em>Journal of Functional Ecology</em></a>, the study provides the first look at the impact of seismic noise on the physiological responses of a deep-diving cetacean. According to Williams, the combination of extremely low heart rates, increased heart rate variability, and high-intensity exercise during deep dives presents a significant physiological challenge for narwhals, especially if the disruptions are prolonged as would be likely during extended oil exploration activities.</p>
<p>Narwhals live year-round in high Arctic waters where sea ice has helped isolate them from disturbance by humans for millions of years. But declines in polar sea ice are making the region more accessible to shipping, natural resource exploration, and other human activities.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/12/narwhals.html">previous study</a>, Williams and her coauthors showed that narwhals released after entanglement in nets set by indigenous hunters showed a similar physiological response, with extremely low heart rates during intense exercise in a series of escape dives. The difference between a capture event and noise, Williams said, is the potential duration of the disturbance.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they escape from the nets, their heart rate comes back up to a more normal rate within three or four dives, but with the seismic ship moving through and the sound bouncing around, the escape response occurred over a longer period,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The researchers recorded not only extremely low heart rates during noise exposure, but also increased variability, with heart rates switching rapidly between extremely low rates associated with fear and fast rates associated with intense exercise. Reduced heart rate, or bradycardia, is a normal part of the mammalian dive response, but during normal dives the heart rate still increases with exercise. In addition, narwhals and other deep-diving marine mammals usually save energy by gliding rather than actively swimming as they descend to depth.</p>
<p>During noise exposure, the narwhals performed 80% less gliding during diving descents, their swimming strokes exceeded 40 strokes per minute, their heart rates dropped below 10 beats per minute, and their breathing at the surface was 1.5 times faster. Overall, this unusual reaction is very costly in terms of energy consumption, Williams said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only is the reaction costly in terms of the energy needed for diving, the escape time will also take away from time spent foraging for food and other normal behaviors,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The studies were conducted in Scoresby Sound on the east coast of Greenland, where coauthor Mads Peter Heide-J&#248;rgensen, a research professor at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, has been studying the East Greenland narwhal population for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Williams's group at UC Santa Cruz developed instruments that enable researchers to monitor the exercise physiology of marine mammals during dives. The instruments were attached to narwhals with suction cups and fell off after one to three days, floating to the surface where they could be recovered by the scientists.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, noise from human activities such as military sonar has been linked to mass strandings of deep-diving cetaceans, mostly beaked whales. These deep-diving species are extremely difficult to study, and it was only through a partnership with indigenous hunters that Williams and Heide-J&#248;rgensen&#8217;s teams were able to attach monitoring devices to narwhals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the potential impacts on the animals take place underwater, so it&#8217;s really difficult to study,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;We are fortunate to have this technology to show what&#8217;s happening at depth where these animals live in order to understand how their biology may be disrupted.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Williams and Heide-J&#248;rgensen, the coauthors of the paper include Susan Blackwell at Greeneridge Sciences, Outi Tervo and Eva Garde at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, Mikkel-Holger Sinding at University of Copenhagen, and Beau Richter at UC Santa Cruz. This work was supported by the U.S. Office of Naval Research, Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, the Environmental Agency for Mineral Resource Activities of the Government of Greenland, the Danish Ministry of Environment, and the Carlsberg Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

the California higher education system to diversify the California public university faculty and tech workforce</article-subhead><article-text><p>The State of California has approved $5 million in funding for the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/calbridge/index.shtml">Cal-Bridge program</a>, which provides a pathway for underrepresented students in California Community Colleges and the California State University (CSU) system to pursue advanced PhD degrees through the University of California system and join the California science and technology workforce, including as public university faculty.</p>
<p>The Cal-Bridge program, launched in 2014, is a statewide partnership between 9 UC, 23 CSU, and 116 community colleges across California supporting CSU students majoring in physics, computer science, and mathematics to matriculate into PhD programs across the state and nation. The new California state budget allocation will enable Cal-Bridge to expand the subject areas covered and extend its impact, supporting Cal-Bridge scholars all the way from their CSU undergraduate studies through their UC PhDs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new state funding will provide more young Californians from historically underrepresented communities with the opportunity to pursue a doctorate degree and access the support needed to successfully complete the degree and thrive in their chosen professions,&#8221; said Lori Kletzer, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Bruce Schumm, a professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz who co-leads the Northern California Cal-Bridge program, said plans for the expansion include developing a comprehensive program of support and professional development through the years of graduate study. &#8220;This generous funding from the state will allow us to complete a unique, end-to-end pathway that can support students from our diverse community college and CSU campuses from the earliest steps of their college education through their entrance into careers in academia and industry,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The expanded program will build a pathway for thousands of California students from diverse backgrounds to achieve the expertise needed to fill university faculty and technology leadership positions in California and beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversifying the professoriate will lead to a growth in gender, racial, and ethnic representation in the technology workforce more broadly by increasing the number of students from historically underrepresented groups completing degrees in STEM fields because they see faculty that look like them,&#8221; said Cal-Bridge Executive Director Alexander Rudolph, professor of physics and astronomy at Cal Poly Pomona. &#8220;As countries around the world are increasing their investment in science and technology, making sure our nation uses all of the available talent in developing our expertise and capabilities in these fields is an issue of economic and national security.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so proud to have secured $5 million in the California State budget for the Cal-Bridge program to diversify the State&#8217;s science and technology workforce,&#8221; said <a href="https://cottie.com/meetcottie/">Assemblywoman Cottie Petrie-Norris (D-Irvine)</a>, who was the chief sponsor of the effort to win funding for the initiative in the state budget. &#8220;Breaking down barriers to entry into STEM fields for historically underrepresented groups and diversifying California&#8217;s public university professoriate will help California continue to thrive as a world-class hub for innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>UCSC graduate student Rene Padilla is a Cal-Bridge scholar who credits the program with clearing his pathway to a Ph.D. Padilla started his education at Modesto Junior College, going on to receive his B.S. degree in physics from Stanislaus State in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;Making the transition from a community college to a CSU campus was challenging,&#8221; said Padilla. &#8220;However, doing the transition from a CSU to a PhD was even harder and more complex. Nevertheless, the Cal-Bridge community gave me the necessary tools to successfully make the transition and move forward towards my dream school. Now, after several years, I am a candidate for a PhD in physics at UC Santa Cruz. I never imagined that I could make it that far, but having the support from a program like Cal-Bridge made a big difference in my life. I am sure that increasing the resources of the Cal-Bridge program will increase the chances of students like me to get into high-level education programs.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://a19.asmdc.org/">Phil Ting (D-San Francisco)</a>, Chair of the Assembly Budget Committee and <a href="https://sd09.senate.ca.gov/biography">Nancy Skinner (D-East Bay)</a>, Chair of the Senate Budget Committee together helped shepherd the appropriation into the state budget and are both excited to support the Cal-Bridge Initiative. Ting commented, &#8220;Cal-Bridge is a uniquely Californian treasure, ensuring fair and equal access to all the opportunities offered by our state&#8217;s outstanding higher education system. Cal-Bridge opens doors for all in our state to the most exciting and well-paid careers in science and technology, regardless of where they start their education. I&#8217;m excited to support Cal-Bridge, to see it funded in this year&#8217;s budget and look forward to watching it grow to benefit thousands of Californians over the coming years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skinner added, &#8220;California has made progress in diversifying our public colleges and universities, but there is still much work to do. Black and Latinx students, in particular, remain underrepresented at our CSU and UC campuses. The Cal-Bridge program is essential to closing this racial gap, which is why I&#8217;m proud the Legislature and Governor have agreed to fund it in this year&#8217;s state budget. Cal-Bridge not only is effective at attracting underrepresented students to STEM fields, but also in ensuring that our cohort of future college professors in physics, computer science, and mathematics is diverse as well.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>About Cal-Bridge:</strong> The Cal-Bridge program has the mission to create a comprehensive, end-to-end pathway for undergraduates from the diverse student population of the CSU system through graduate school to a PhD, postdoctoral fellowship, and ultimately membership in the professoriate and science and technology workforce. Students in the program are referred to as Cal-Bridge scholars.</p>
<p>The program is a partnership between 9 University of California (UC), all 23 California State University (CSU), and the 116 community college campuses in California, thus fulfilling the promise of cross-segmental cooperation envisioned in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Master_Plan_for_Higher_Education">California Master Plan for Higher Education</a>. Scholars are recruited from CSU and community college campuses across the state, with the help of local faculty and/or staff liaisons at each campus. Community college students transfer to a participating CSU to join the program.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d9c5713a807270460992605bba2b386b"><name>humanities-spring-awards-2022</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>The Humanities Division honors faculty, alumni, and students at the 2021-22 Spring Awards</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz’s Humanities Division marked the end of the school year with their Spring Awards, a ceremony that celebrates the achievements of students, instructors, and alumni.</summary><start-date>1657177200000</start-date><path>/2022/07/humanities-spring-awards-2022</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/07/humanities-spring-awards-2022</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1657216004378</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1657217145001</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Bob Ham</name><title></title><phone/><email>rmham@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/elaine-sullivan---michaels---kwan---hart.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/elaine-sullivan---michaels---kwan---hart.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>elaine-sullivan---michaels---kwan---hart.jpg</name><display-name>elaine-sullivan---michaels---kwan---hart.jpg</display-name><file-size>993767</file-size><width>1500</width><height>1000</height></image><image-alt>Sullivan, Kwan, Hart and Michaels</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/mark-zemelman-jasmine-alinder-copy.png</path><link>site://news/2022/mark-zemelman-jasmine-alinder-copy.png</link><site>news</site><name>mark-zemelman-jasmine-alinder-copy.png</name><display-name>mark-zemelman-jasmine-alinder-copy.png</display-name><file-size>15726</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elaine Sullivan, professor of history, was awarded the Dizikes Faculty Teaching Award.

Marking the moment in her opening remarks, Chancellor Cynthia Larive told the dozens in attendance at the Cowell Ranch Hay Barn and watching online, &#8220;It&#8217;s such a pleasure to recognize the work you&#8217;ve done. It speaks to your commitment to yourselves, to your colleagues, to this university, and to the Humanities themselves.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One crowning moment of this year&#8217;s ceremony was the bestowing of the Dizikes Faculty Teaching Award to Elaine Sullivan, Associate Professor of History. A member of the UC Santa Cruz faculty since 2013, Sullivan was chosen to receive the award by a panel of her colleagues and her students. As Humanities Division Dean Jasmine Alinder recounted in her introduction, Professor Sullivan was praised for her dedication and compassion and her ability to bring &#8220;a lecture to life. From one moment to the next, students went from quietly scribbling lecture notes to buzzing with excitement.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan accepted the award with no small amount of humility and humor, commenting that the challenges of teaching classes online due to the pandemic brought up rare feelings of panic in her and saluting her students for rising to meet the moment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of her award, Sullivan was able to hand out scholarships, in her name, to students who have made extraordinary academic strides during the 2021-22 school year. Those gifts were given to a trio of fourth year history majors: Athena Kwan, Ryan Hart, and Sage Michaels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ceremony began with another special honor, bestowing the 2022 Humanities Distinguished Undergraduate Alumni Award upon Mark Zemelman, who just retired as the senior vice president and general counsel for nonprofit medical group Kaiser Permanente.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zemelman entered UC Santa Cruz in 1972, studying chemistry at Crown College. But it was a course in Western Civilization taught by William Hitchcock that changed the course of his education and his life. As he remembered in his acceptance speech, Hitchcock taught him that &#8220;even though we are born into a historical context, we connect ourselves with the past and future&#8221; and that by recognizing those connections, &#8220;we can actually make a real difference.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s Spring Awards event was also marked by the introduction of two new awards: The Jay Family Humanities Scholarship For Undergraduates Focused on Social Justice and Diversity, and the Mollie Cass Sater Memorial Scholarship in Jewish Studies. The former is a $5,000 scholarship that was handed to Maria R. Hele who is currently pursuing a double major in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies and Feminist Studies. The latter prize, which supports an undergraduate student with financial need who displays a strong interest in Jewish Studies, was awarded to Maia Zelker to support her project researching Hebrew poetry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The residential college is undergoing a comprehensive renewal. When the expansive project is completed, it will include housing for approximately 970 undergraduates, about 600 more beds than what the college originally held. Plans for the second phase of the Kresge construction project will be considered by the UC Board of Regents later this year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is wonderful news for our students and for our efforts to boost our stock of on-campus student housing,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;I am grateful for the state investment. Student housing is such a critical need for our campus, and this project helps us advance our efforts to house more students on campus while supporting their educational success.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Regents approved the renewal project in March 2019 and construction began later that year. The first phase, which includes new residential halls and a new 35,000-square-foot academic center and plaza, is set to be finished during the 2022-23 academic year. The Kresge Academic Center will have classrooms serving the entire campus and will include a 600-seat lecture hall, the largest on campus; a 150-seat lecture hall; 50- and 35-seat classrooms; a 48-seat computing lab, as well as departmental space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The iconic Kresge architecture will be reconstructed and renovated to retain the historic design, but with more durable and resilient materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other features include a new cafe, which will be built close to the front of the Academic Plaza, and a pedestrian trail that will weave in and out of the cluster of three new residential halls, providing connections throughout the college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire project, including the second phase of construction that will begin at the south end of Kresge this fall, is expected to be finished in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When first approved, the Kresge Renewal project included about 550 beds, counting both new construction and existing residential buildings. Given the critical need for additional student housing, project planners revised the design to nearly double that amount, increasing it to approximately 980, said Jolie Kerns, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Director of Physical and Environmental Planning. This results in a net of 615 new beds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from maximizing the capacity of existing apartments, the Kresge project replaces older buildings that provided 365 beds with three new residence halls providing 400 beds intended for first-year students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus is planning to increase the number of beds by adding a third floor to a number of existing buildings, including one that was originally slated to be removed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the decade ahead, UC Santa Cruz plans to move forward on a bold and ambitious path that will continue to increase the amount of housing for current and future students. In addition to the Kresge College renewal, another approved project, Student Housing West, is in the midst of overcoming legal challenges. Student Housing West will enable UC Santa Cruz to offer much more housing to its graduate students and upper-division undergraduates by building new housing units with space for around 3,000 students. The project, spread across two sites, will also allow the campus to expand child-care services to serve the children of faculty, staff, and students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus leaders are working to develop a multi-year housing plan with a project ladder that has projects in the planning, design or construction stage at all times. This will allow UCSC to move on to another project if one is delayed and regularly deliver beds to meet its goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These bold future plans will build on the campus&#8217;s longstanding commitment to providing an on-campus residential experience for students. The campus currently provides housing for more than half of its undergraduates. While this is one of the highest percentages in the UC system, UCSC leaders say it is not high enough. Campus efforts to build more on-campus housing continue in earnest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two decades, the campus has increased its student housing capacity by 3,300 beds through structural modifications, such as adding floors, major building redesigns and by increasing the density in residence halls.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ef3cbbd2807270460992605bb4a42da6"><name>keynote-state-budget</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>State budget passage good news for our campus </title><summary>The 2022-23 state budget that Gov.

Gavin Newsom signed into law just two weeks ago is a boon for the University of California system as a whole and for our campus specifically. It will strengthen our ability to help students succeed, advance our academic and research goals, and help us address campus infrastructure and capital needs. These positive outcomes are the result of a historic budget surplus of nearly $100 billion coupled with focused advocacy by&#160; campus and system leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the passage of </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB178"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assembly Bill 178</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the higher education budget trailer bill, </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB183"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assembly Bill 183</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the state Legislature and governor forged an agreement with UC for unprecedented levels of funding. We are grateful our state leaders recognized that now is the time to invest in higher education and the UC campuses, which are in need of both ongoing and one-time funding for deferred maintenance, capital outlay, and a greater investment in students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m pleased that this budget includes $360 million in</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">new, ongoing funding to the UC system. This includes a systemwide 5 percent increase to the base budget this year, with a five-year funding compact proposed by the governor. This provides the reliable funding necessary for the system to expand access to a world-class UC education to more Californians. It also supports the hiring of additional faculty. Also included in these new ongoing UC funds is $15 million for former foster youth, undocumented students, and those whose lives have been impacted by the carceral system. Additionally, this budget provides $125 million in one-time funds, systemwide, for deferred maintenance, seismic mitigation and energy-efficiency projects. UC Santa Cruz is also eligible, along with five other campuses, to apply for $3 million in ongoing funding in support of research, education and public engagement on labor issues in California.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several key funding areas specific to our campus. These one-time dollars will be essential in addressing some of our most critical needs. I&#8217;m pleased to announce that UC Santa Cruz will receive $89 million in state grant funds to expand student housing in Phase 2 of the Kresge renovation project, providing housing relief for many students. In addition, this year&#8217;s Budget Act </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes &#8220;intent language&#8221; to provide $900 million in the Budget Act of 2023, and an additional $900 million in the Budget Act of 2024, to establish a revolving loan program for student-housing projects proposed by campuses in the University of California, California State University, and California Community Colleges, pursuant to pending legislation. This may become an extremely important source of financing for future UC housing projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also of importance in this budget, the governor and Legislature have recognized the great research being done at UC Santa Cruz in the area of climate change, resilience, and coastal sustainability. The budget includes an allocation of $20 million for the development of a Center for Coastal Climate Resilience at UCSC. This is extraordinary recognition of our campus&#8217;s preeminence in this area due to the contributions of our amazing faculty, staff and students. The goal of the center will be to pull together campus research and to partner with state and federal agencies as well as private foundations to address climate change, especially in coastal regions. The Office of Research will head up the effort and form a task force to help advise and guide the use of these funds. More information will be provided in the coming weeks on this topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am so pleased with this year&#8217;s state budget. I have been honored to work with our state legislative leaders and truly appreciate the leadership of our campus representatives, Sen. John Laird and Assemblymember Mark Stone, in helping ensure that UC Santa Cruz and California&#8217;s students are getting the resources they need to be successful. This budget is foundational, and will help UC Santa Cruz advance our state and our students </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">well into the future.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f2f057a3807270460992605b1b8ba289"><name>brodsky-nemmers-prize</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Seismologist Emily Brodsky awarded Nemmers Prize in Earth Sciences</title><summary>Professor Emily Brodsky has received the 2022 Nemmers Prize in Earth Sciences, awarded by Northwestern University for achievement and work of lasting significance in the field of Earth sciences.</summary><start-date>1657724400000</start-date><display-name>Seismologist Emily Brodsky awarded Nemmers Prize in Earth Sciences</display-name><path>/2022/07/brodsky-nemmers-prize</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/07/brodsky-nemmers-prize</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1657638246267</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1657745581635</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/emily-brodsky-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/emily-brodsky-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>emily-brodsky-350.jpg</name><display-name>emily-brodsky-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>110199</file-size><width>350</width><height>393</height></image><image-alt>Emily Brodsky</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/emily-brodsky-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/emily-brodsky-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>emily-brodsky-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>emily-brodsky-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>28606</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Emily Brodsky</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Emily Brodsky (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Emily Brodsky, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has received the 2022 Nemmers Prize in Earth Sciences, awarded by Northwestern University for achievement and work of lasting significance in the field of Earth sciences.</p>
<p>The prize recognizes Brodsky for her &#8220;fundamental, transdisciplinary contributions to understanding the physics of earthquake networks at all scales.&#8221; In addition to an award of $200,000, she will interact with Northwestern faculty and students through lectures, conferences, or seminars.</p>
<p>As an earthquake physicist, Brodsky studies the mechanics underlying earthquakes, addressing questions about the processes that trigger earthquakes and the constraining forces and processes that occur inside a fault zone during slip. These studies require expertise in a variety of geoscience disciplines, including seismology, hydrogeology, structural geology, and rock mechanics.</p>
<p>After the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake off the coast of Japan, Brodsky helped organize and lead a major international expedition to study the fault. Her recent work includes important findings about earthquakes induced by human activities in which fluids are injected deep underground (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, wastewater disposal, and geothermal wells). She is currently chair of SZ4D, a coordinated research initiative to investigate the processes that underlie subduction zone hazards.</p>
<p>Brodsky earned her A.B. from Harvard University in 1995 and Ph.D. in geophysics from the California Institute of Technology in 2001. A fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and the Geological Society of America (GSA), she has received many awards and honors for her work, including the 2008 James Macelwane Medal from the AGU, the 2019 Woollard Award from the GSA, and the 2021 Price Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. Brodsky has served on the boards of directors of the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) and the Incorporated Research Institutes for Seismology (IRIS). She has published over 130 peer-reviewed articles and has presented over 150 invited lectures in 30 states and 13 countries, and her work has been widely featured in the media.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study, published in the journal </span><a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article/10/1/00098/187810/Comparative-life-cycle-assessment-of-heterotrophic"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elementa</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, found that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schizochytrium sp. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">could be a more sustainable feed ingredient than fish oil in categories like global warming impact and use of biotic resources from living organisms. However, there were comparatively greater environmental impacts in other areas&#8212;like freshwater use, land use, and nutrient pollution potential in oceans and freshwater&#8212;primarily due to steps in the production process for the microalga that are linked to land-based agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers say that identifying these types of tradeoffs is crucial in weighing the benefits of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schizochytrium sp.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an aquaculture fish feed ingredient. In an effort to take pressure off of ocean ecosystems, some aquaculture feeds are now being formulated with a variety of alternative ingredients in place of fish oil. Marine microalgae are promising options because they can provide farm-raised fish with levels of omega-3 fatty acids similar to wild fish.&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schizochytrium sp.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in particular, is one of few microalgae varieties that is already being produced on a commercial scale for use in human dietary supplements and aquaculture feeds. UC Santa Cruz researchers have been </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/11/fish-free-feed.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experimenting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with it to formulate new high-performing fish-free feed options and wanted to better understand the overall sustainability of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schizochytrium sp.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by taking a look at its entire production process. So they worked to expand scientific and publicly available information on the topic by conducting a comprehensive life cycle sustainability assessment that reflects current industry best-practices and is replicable and shareable in an open-access format.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This study could be useful for microalgae production companies and aquafeed manufacturers&#160; in understanding what the environmental impacts of this feed ingredient are and also guiding efforts to make targeted improvements in its production,&#8221; said Brandi McKuin, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz and lead author of the new study. &#8220;Overall, I think our findings are a hopeful message that microalgae can be a sustainable ingredient, and with a little more work across the supply chain, it could become even more so.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team specifically focused on comparing the sustainability of fish oil versus a blend of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schizochytrium sp.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and canola oil to replace both the DHA omega-3 fatty acids and lipid content of fish oil. These two feed ingredient options were analyzed across six sustainability categories: Global warming potential, water consumption, land use, marine eutrophication potential, freshwater eutrophication potential, and biotic resource use.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers used data from published literature and patents to model the sustainability impacts of both ingredient options, and then they ground-truthed their assumptions with volunteer industry advisors. The study also considered several different methods of preparing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schizochytrium sp. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for inclusion in fish feeds, since it can either be used as whole cells or processed into oils using microwave or solvent extraction techniques.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feed ingredients formulated using </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schizochytrium sp.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had less impact than fish oil on biotic resource depletion across all forms of preparation, while the whole-cell method, in particular, had significantly lower global warming potential than fish oil, due to lesser processing than methods for extracting oils from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schizochytrium sp.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But between the two oil extraction methods</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conventional solvent extraction had significantly lower environmental impacts than microwave extraction in all categories except global warming potential.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schizochytrium sp. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">had higher environmental impacts than fish oil on freshwater consumption, land use, marine eutrophication potential, and freshwater eutrophication potential, in large part because </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schizochytrium sp.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> must be fed sugars while it&#8217;s being grown commercially. Those sugars come from land-based agriculture sources. The study analyzed two sources in particular: sugarcane grown in Brazil, and sugar beets grown in the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers say that their results, showing the large impact of the cultivation process for these sugars on the overall sustainability of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schizochytrium sp.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">may be an opportunity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Companies might actually be able to use these results to encourage increased sustainability in how these sugar crops are being grown,&#8221; said Environmental Studies Professor Anne Kapuscinski, senior author of the new paper. &#8220;If there are ways to produce these crops that use less water, are land-sparing, or use less fertilizer or use organic fertilizers, this study might help open the door to have those kinds of conversations.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the study illustrates how replacing ocean-derived fish oil with alternative aquaculture feed ingredients can shift the environmental burden from sea to land. However, the research team says that prioritizing among these types of trade-offs is a complex decision-making process. Each benefit and impact must be weighed within global and regional contexts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every choice has some kind of environmental impact, so you&#8217;re always going to find trade-offs in a life cycle assessment,&#8221; Kapuscinski said. &#8220;There is no one silver bullet, but laying out estimates like these of what the impacts are, based on the best scientific evidence available, can really help with informed decision making in sustainability efforts.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f36b6336807270460992605b915f3602"><name>lux-resilience-game</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Alternate reality game launching Fall ‘22 will measure resilience of first-year students</title><summary>“LUX,” a non-traditional research project to measure the resilience of its players, will officially launch this fall, recruiting participants from the incoming first-year class..</summary><start-date>1657641600000</start-date><path>/2022/07/lux-resilience-game</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/07/lux-resilience-game</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1657646310159</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1657646310159</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computational Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/playtesting350.png</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/playtesting350.png</link><site>news</site><name>playtesting350.png</name><display-name>playtesting350.png</display-name><file-size>225974</file-size><width>350</width><height>244</height></image><image-alt>Students scans his phone to a AR marker in a wooded area on the UCSC campus.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/playtesting80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/playtesting80.png</link><site>news</site><name>playtesting80.png</name><display-name>playtesting80.png</display-name><file-size>19292</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Students scans his phone to a AR marker in a wooded area on the UCSC campus.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Participants in "LUX" scan AR markers located on the UCSC main campus which lead them to puzzles and clues.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Two students approach the Quarry Amphitheater, phones in hand, ready to find and scan a small marker that will provide them with clues to a mystery rooted in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s past. A group, calling themselves Kerr&#8217;s Loyalists, had sent them on a mission: scour the campus to look for a secret artifact that can return the University to its original values. A quick message in their Discord channels alerts the rest of their four-person team that they&#8217;ve successfully found the nondescript marker, and following congratulations from the team, they're off to decode the next puzzle.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These students were participating in a play-test session of &#8220;LUX,&#8221; an alternate reality historical fiction game designed by researchers in UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://guiilab.ucsc.edu/home"><span class="s2">Game User Interaction and Intelligence (GUII)</span></a> Lab directed by computational media professor and department chair Magy Seif El-Nasr and the </span><span class="s3">Interaction Dynamics (ID) Lab</span><span class="s1"> directed by Assistant Professor of Computational Media Elin Carstensdottir. &#8220;LUX&#8221; was designed as a non-traditional research project to measure the resilience of its players. This fall, the game will officially launch, recruiting participants from the incoming first-year class, particularly targeting those from historically marginalized communities.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While resilience has been studied for decades by psychology researchers, the team of engineers hopes to leverage technology to create a game that can serve as a better, more innovative approach to this research. The researchers are currently focused on designing the game to be engaging and discovering the best ways to measure the complicated topic of resilience. They have aspirations to further enhance the game with interventions that work to build the resilience of its players and connect them to resources on campus.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Our vision is to have a game or an application to give you a good estimate of your resilience, and then help you to find your weak points and work on it throughout the game, through practice,&#8221; said Reza Habibi, the game&#8217;s producer and a Ph.D. student in the GUII lab. &#8220;It's totally doable.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Designing &#8220;LUX&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The game&#8217;s narrative is based in the history of UCSC&#8217;s earliest days, when then-UC President Clark Kerr founded the campus as an <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2014/12/birth-of-ucsc.html"><span class="s2">educational experiment</span></a>, without letter grades and as a scruffy, free-thinking response to entrenched conservative thought of the 1950s. Players are enlisted to aid a fictional group called Kerr&#8217;s Loyalists, who need their help finding a secret stolen artifact that they say is the key to returning the campus to its original values, which they claim were lost along with the artifact when the campus started implementing letter grades in the 80s.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Teams of three or four students participate in the game over a session that lasts several weeks, communicating with each other and the game moderators on the messaging platform Discord. Along the way, the players must find augmented reality (AR) markers &#8211; scannable tokens that bring virtual elements such as games and animations into the physical world &#8211; that lead them to solve a series of puzzles and smaller mysteries which require collaboration among the team. In exploring the campus for clues, students can gain familiarity with their new home.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The moderators are characters who guide them through the story and who are named after elements of the natural environment of UCSC, such as &#8220;Empire Cave,&#8221; &#8220;Mima Mound,&#8221; and &#8220;Oracle Oak.&#8221; In reality, these are the games&#8217; designers, most of whom are Computational Media Ph.D. students&#160; at the Baskin School of Engineering, getting into character and interacting directly with the players. So far, the researchers have run two play test sessions during the 2021-22 academic year in order to gather more insight on how to best measure resilience and smooth out wrinkles in the game&#8217;s narrative and execution before the official launch.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This combination of a fictional narrative played out in the real world &#8211; both in physical and virtual spaces &#8211; makes &#8220;LUX'' an alternate reality game (ARG), a format which the researchers believe has the ability to transform psychology research. They see using an ARG for this type of research as a better way of measuring resilience as it does not remove the participants from their natural, day-to-day environments, unlike more traditional studies performed in a lab setting.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;One of the reasons I find ARGs fascinating is because they blend this aspect of reality and fiction in a strange way,&#8221; said Bjarke Larsen, a game designer and Ph.D. student in the ID lab whose research is centered around narrative in ARG. &#8220;They use real world elements, websites, and physical locations but also have a fictional element of characters, which people interact with in a very similar way to how they would interact with nonfictional elements.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This format allows the designers to keep their players engaged through an intriguing narrative that includes interactivity, as the participants&#8217; choices allow them to prod at and modify the story. Increased engagement can keep the participants involved for longer, giving the researchers a better chance to study how resilience changes over time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;If you're not engaged in the game, you're not going to get any benefit from it,&#8221; Seif El-Nasr said. &#8220;So that was our first motive: to figure out how to engage the students in a game they care about.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1"><strong>Measuring resilience</strong></span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">As the players progress through the storyline, the team of researchers collect a wealth of data that goes into their measure of resilience, an important concept that holds many possible definitions within the field of psychology and beyond. While the researchers are not pinned down by any traditional definition of resilience, they generally see the term as representing the ability of a person to bounce back and recover in the face of challenges. They are also interested in a person&#8217;s ability to regulate their emotions and find and maintain social connections during challenging times.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The research team sees resilience as especially important in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather events, and political and social unrest. Seif El-Nasr says universities have a role in developing the resilience of their students in order to make them better learners and more prepared for the challenges of life ahead of them.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Resilience is a way of coping through life and its changes,&#8221; Seif El-Nasr said. &#8220;This, to me, is why resilience is a very important quality, and it can be learned and increased through the right approaches to learning.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The team particularly hopes to support historically marginalized students, who are more likely to face barriers to success in engineering courses. The researchers note that the group&#8217;s approach to studying resilience must be nuanced and flexible to the diverse experiences of their participants, and they must strive to be as unbiased as possible in their research.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;When you want to study any aspect of resilience, you need to be very careful about your populations, your focus groups, their personalities, and their cultures and backgrounds,&#8221; Habibi said. &#8220;When you review literature and definitions, some people even define resilience as a strong connection to your culture. You can not go and tackle all of this with one game, you need to be very dynamic, and that is why this is a very long and complicated project &#8211; there are thousands of factors.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The researchers are taking a data-driven approach to this project, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-05637-6_38"><span class="s2">as outlined in a new paper</span></a> which was named the<a href="https://2022.hci.international/HCI-Games-best-paper-award.html"><span class="s2"> best paper</span></a> at the 2022 International Conference on Human Computer Interaction in Games. Their methods involve evaluating information collected from social mechanics within the game relating to collaboration, compliments, recommendation, and encouragement. The team has created data visualizations from the two play test sessions that have occurred so far, and will collaborate with psychologists to translate this data into measurements of resilience.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Players are instructed to keep daily diaries, and the Discord chat allows the researchers to monitor how the players struggle and cope with the need to solve the game&#8217;s challenging puzzles on top of their lives as busy students. Pre- and post-game interviews with players help the researchers learn about the player&#8217;s coping strategies, and longer-term follow-ups check in on the wellbeing of the players and the degree to which they&#8217;ve maintained relationships made during the game.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Future interventions</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the researchers are currently focusing on measuring the resilience of its players, they envision future iterations could include interventions to build resilience. These interventions would be centered around building skills important for success as first-year students: how to find a community on campus, how to approach that community, and how to maintain those relationships.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">The researchers aim to better understand the particular needs of historically marginalized students through an ethnography study they will run next fall. They hope that learning more about these student&#8217;s pain points can help them target the overall design toward their needs, especially by taking advantage of and connecting students with University resources such as the Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP).</span></p>

</figure>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">&#8220;From a measuring standpoint, we need to see which factors here are important,&#8221; Habibi said. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t they find the support? Is it unavailable, or they don&#8217;t know about it, or they know and they&#8217;re shy? Then the intervention comes; they might need a better relationship with their professors, we could introduce them to an existing support system, or tell them how to ask for help in a better way in our game.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As they gear up for the official game launch this upcoming fall, the researchers note that feedback from their test sessions told them that not only were students genuinely interested in the story and characters of the game, they are making friendships through their teams and&#160; gaining deeper benefits from it.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;When we started the game, we mostly focused on production, rather than intervention &#8211; but still we got intervention effects after the game,&#8221; Habibi said. &#8220;That told us that there's a huge potential here.&#8221;</span></p>

This dry spell is expected to get worse over the summer and could have devastating consequences for California&#8217;s ecosystems, especially if the late rains spur another intense fire season.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Concerned about the potential loss of biodiversity in such extreme conditions, Beth Shapiro, Associate Director of Conservation Genomics at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, is taking urgent action to record our current biodiversity before it is too late. To do this, she is launching a pilot program this summer called Accelerating Science to Prepare for an Inclusive and Resilient Earth (ASPIRE), funded by a generous and timely gift from the Helen &amp; Will Webster Foundation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The first step to understanding how these events impact biodiversity is to know what is there now &#8211; we must collect these baseline data,&#8221; Shapiro said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ASPIRE is modeled from University of California&#8217;s successful CALeDNA program and will use eDNA to track biodiversity changes driven by drought, wildfire, agriculture, and urbanization, as well as other forms of human impact. These data will allow researchers to learn how biodiversity drives ecosystem resilience and will be key to devising strategies to prevent future biodiversity loss despite our changing climate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The project will take advantage of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s expertise in ancient and environmental DNA to combat the challenges of identifying and quantifying the short and degraded sequences that have impeded the use of environmental samples for tracking biodiversity in the past. The goal is to develop a "total biodiversity" surveillance system that will couple novel approaches to eDNA isolation with machine learning to predict and characterize changes in biodiversity over time and identify drivers of ecosystem resilience that environmentalists might harness to develop conservation strategies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Engaging future generations to save the planet</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Student engagement is key to the ASPIRE program, which aims to increase and diversify the STEM workforce by providing students with opportunities to engage in cutting-edge approaches to scientific inquiry. The program will help students develop a basic understanding of core concepts in biology and provide a real-world context that matters deeply: the health of our planet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This summer&#8217;s pilot program will engage teams composed of one graduate student and three to four undergraduate students to collect samples from 10 sensitive zones near rivers in California. Metadata will then be collated from these samples, and they will be archived for future processing.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://foundation.ucsc.edu/trustees/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Board of Trustees has elected as new members pharmaceutical and biotherapeutic entrepreneur Greg Reyes, of San Diego, (Kresge &#8217;76, biology) and business banking leader Janet Buck, of Laguna Niguel. Their appointments began July 1.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundation board works in close partnership with Chancellor Cynthia Larive and other university leaders to advance private philanthropic support for the campus mission, while also fostering greater understanding of UCSC's activities and impact by the broader Santa Cruz community, California and the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am thrilled that Greg and Janet are joining the board,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;Greg&#8217;s extensive entrepreneurial work and Janet&#8217;s financial background and startup experience will be great assets as we work together to secure much needed resources to advance the university and its impact on the region, state and country.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Reyes graduated from UC Santa Cruz, he attended the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he earned both an M.D. and a Ph.D. in pharmacology. Over the course of his career, Reyes has served as scientific leader with many biopharmaceutical firms including senior vice president roles at Celgene and Biogen Idec. He has authored nearly 100 scientific publications and been co-inventor on about 50 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Reyes is currently engaged with a number of San Diego-based biotech companies and start-up ventures and continues to advise the Cancer Research UK charitable organization on new drug development funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The work of the foundation is critical to ensuring the futures of UC Santa Cruz students as they develop into our next generation of leaders,&#8221; Reyes said. &#8220;I eagerly look forward to assisting the foundation in its ongoing mission.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buck has served since 2016 as a senior managing director in the business banking division at First Republic Bank, leading the Orange County and San Diego business banking teams. She established the </span><a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/tony-awaida-fund-for-environmental-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony Awaida Fund for Environmental Solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018 in honor of her late son&#8217;s memory. This endowed fund supports the </span><a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coastal Science &amp; Policy program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is training the next generation of coastal science and policy leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is an honor to be of service to UC Santa Cruz as it continues its legacy as one of the most innovative and impactful universities in the country,&#8221; Buck said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buck has also co-founded two businesses. Xporta, a Santa Clara-based startup software and global sales acceleration solutions firm, was founded in 1999 and acquired in 2005. She co-founded Emergent Success, a leadership consulting firm with her husband, Kevin Buck, in 2006. She holds a bachelor&#8217;s degree in international relations from Boston University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Foundation Chair Richard F. Moss called Buck and Reyes strong additions&#160; to the Board of Trustees</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are excited to collaborate with such accomplished and well-respected entrepreneurs and thought-leaders in furthering the board&#8217;s mission to grow UCSC&#8217;s endowments and reputation and to maximize student success,&#8221; Moss said.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art Torres (Stevenson, &#8216;68, government), has completed a two-year appointment as an alumni representative on the UC Board of Regents, a role that included serving as an ex-officio member of both the Foundation Board and the Alumni Council.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torres, who served in the California State Assembly (1974-1982), the state Senate (1982-1994), and as chair of the California Democratic Party (1996-2009), was named the fifth UC Santa Cruz alumnus to serve as an Alumni Regent in 2020. He is also the </span><a href="https://www.cirm.ca.gov/board-and-meetings/senator-art-torres-ret-jd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vice chair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the governing board of the </span><a href="https://www.cirm.ca.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CIRM).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, the UC Santa Cruz Foundation board has championed critical philanthropic support, particularly around the </span><a href="https://success.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Student Success Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Launched this past fall, the initiative aims to increase financial support for undergraduate and graduate students, advancing their access to the guidance and experiences fundamental to their education and ultimately future success. More than $22 million in commitments has already been raised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the foundation board made the extraordinary decision to </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/02/student-success-foundation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase its annual endowment payout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by more than $900,000 to provide additional financial support to students through approximately 130 endowment-funded scholarships and fellowships. This represented a one-time 50 percent increase over what the foundation had provided in the fall to all UCSC endowments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We continue to be grateful for our foundation trustees&#8217; service to and advocacy for the university,&#8221; said Vice Chancellor for University Relations Mark Delos Reyes Davis, who also serves as the foundation&#8217;s president. &#8220;They provide invaluable insight and give vision to our efforts to raise the resources necessary for the university to expand its impact locally and globally.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p>Ping&#8217;s group received a $1.2 million grant for the three-year project, which builds on her previous work developing computational tools for predicting important properties of materials and molecules based on quantum dynamics. Working with co-principal investigator Ravishankar Sundararaman at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Ping&#8217;s team will develop computational techniques and massively-parallel software for the rapidly emerging field of &#8220;spin chemistry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spin is a quantum property of electrons that can affect the interactions of atoms and molecules. Spin chemistry involves using the spin of electrons to control chemical reactions. While Ping&#8217;s previous work on the quantum dynamics of spin has involved applications in quantum computing, the new project will focus on the impact of spin in catalytic materials and photochemistry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can apply the same theoretical framework and computational tools in a different context to study the effects of spin dynamics on chemical reactions,&#8221; Ping said. &#8220;If you can control the spin properties, you can change the products or increase the efficiency of chemical reactions. But realizing the promise of spin chemistry requires a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in the effects of spin on charge transfer and chemical reactivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ping&#8217;s group will develop computational chemistry techniques for predictive modeling of spin dynamics and spin-dependent charge transfer, paving the way towards a detailed mechanistic understanding of spin chemistry.</p>
<p>An important aspect of the project is developing software compatible with the most powerful supercomputers. &#8220;Supercomputers are so fast now, the speed of the hardware is no longer a bottleneck, but the software has to be designed to fit the exascale computational platform,&#8221; Ping said.</p>
<p>Her team will share their computational techniques with the scientific community in open-source code optimized for the most advanced supercomputers. The exascale simulation capabilities being developed by these DOE-funded projects will address a broad range of scientific topics important for clean energy, including carbon dioxide reduction, catalysis, biochemical energy conversion, and clean and sustainable manufacturing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world&#8217;s fastest supercomputers, including the first exascale supercomputer ever built, are hosted at DOE National Laboratories,&#8221; said Harriet Kung, deputy director for science programs at the DOE Office of Science. &#8220;These investments will provide researchers with modeling and simulation software that can deploy that computing power to perform the fundamental research needed to overcome the nation&#8217;s clean energy and low-carbon manufacturing challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://science.osti.gov/-/media/bes/pdf/BES-CCS-2608-Awards-List-2022.pdf">eight funded projects</a> were chosen in a highly competitive peer-review process. Glenn Millhauser, distinguished professor and chair of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC, said they represent the top computational chemistry programs in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will be developing the next generation of computational tools, sure to guide the future of chemical research,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a real credit to Yuan and the impact of her remarkable research program.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.energy.gov/science/articles/department-energy-announces-183-million-research-develop-advanced-chemical</url><title>DOE Announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0c9a8c90807270460992605bce3cb7bd"><name>performance-play-design</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz’s new Department of Performance, Play &amp; Design redefines the art of storytelling for the modern era</title><summary>Earlier this year, the Department of Theater Arts and the Art &amp; Design: Games + Playable Media Program (AGPM) within UC Santa Cruz's Division of the Arts fused to become the  the Department of Performance, Play &amp; Design (PPD).

Renamed the Department of Performance, Play &amp; Design (</span><a href="https://theater.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), it is the only university department in the world to break the traditional silos of theater, dance, and games.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To its faculty and students, the fit seems natural. &#8220;A lot of the questions that performance scholars and artists ask are the very same that games scholars and artists ask,&#8221; says Michael Chemers, Chair of PPD and Professor of Theater Arts. &#8220;Specifically, how do you tell stories through the unfolding of action? How do you do this in a way that causes your audience to identify with your characters or to engage with the action occurring on either a stage or a screen? These art forms are all about dramatic storytelling, and as a result there are certain, very similar questions you are trained to ask when you are an artist in these areas.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPD Associate Chair and Associate Professor of AGPM and Critical Race and Ethnic Studies micha c&#225;rdenas concurs. &#8220;Game design is a profound, ancient way of telling stories by designing their rules. A game is a series of instructions that creates a series of emotions. In playable media, a lot of that emotional response is generated by voice, motion, and face actors, scene design, lighting, narrative. The skills people learn in creating a play or dance are incredibly important to game design.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chemers notes that many faculty were already collaborating across disciplines before the merger as interest in multimedia and multiplatform performance, interactive installation, and interactive narrative design has increasingly blurred traditional categorization. Emblematic of this trend is Professor Marianne Weems, Artistic Director and Founder of the award-winning performance and media ensemble The Builders Association. Weems came to UCSC in 2017 to establish Future Stages, a pioneering two-year MFA research group in Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) that delves into tools and techniques for exploring how crossmedia practice can expand on basic theatrical relationships in new and culturally relevant ways. &#8220;She is the progenitor of the whole genre of incorporating digital tech into live performance and, in many respects, is leading the way for us,&#8221; says Chemers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding these sorts of opportunities for students to work at the intersection of the disciplines is a top priority for PPD faculty and staff. Current plans include the development of a Maker Lab and Virtual Reality (VR) Studio where students can collaborate on new areas of research and artistic inquiry. &#8220;The possibilities are endless,&#8221; says c&#225;rdenas. &#8220;Especially during the pandemic, we saw an explosion of interesting ideas. Even the Royal Shakespeare Company staged </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in VR &#8211; virtual actors, virtual sets, magical effects. One of Oculus&#8217; biggest VR games, &#8216;The Under Presents,&#8217; is essentially a live performance in VR. Our students are going to have so many collaborative opportunities to tell stories together that haven&#8217;t been told.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">c&#225;rdenas stresses this last point. The new department is boldly committed to practices, research, and teaching that speak to the current moment, disrupting oppressive narratives of race and gender, and re-centering historically marginalized communities. &#8220;Changing culture is an essential part of how we all survive,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Our approach is to look at our work as both art and activism.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are helping to shape the performance makers of the future,&#8221; says Arts Division Dean Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu. &#8220;Through our commitment to experimentation and diversity, equity, and inclusion, we support our PPD students in bringing activism, artistry, and agency to their work on campus, online, and beyond. Moreover, PPD connects with industry&#8212;both independent dance and theater companies in the Bay Area and gaming companies in Silicon Valley. Such local, regional, and global collaborations are emblematic of PPD and a hallmark of UCSC."</span></p>

<p><span>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department encourages people on campus or visiting campus to be extra aware of their surroundings after receiving reports of coyotes acting aggressively or coming in proximity to people.</span></p>
<p><span>The most recent reports have come from people around the&#160;Fuel Break/Chinquapin Road areas.&#160; In recent encounters with coyotes they appeared not to be afraid of people and did not back away when challenged.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife offers&#160;<a href="https://wildlife.ca.gov/Keep-Me-Wild/Coyote">these suggestions</a>&#160;to help prevent interactions between humans and coyotes:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span></span><span>Never feed or attempt to tame coyotes. The result may be deadly conflicts with pets or livestock, or serious injuries to small children.</span></li>
<li><span></span><span>Do not leave small children or pets outside unattended.</span></li>
<li><span></span><span>Be aware that coyotes are more active when feeding and protecting their young.</span></li>
<li><span></span><span>If followed by a coyote, make loud noises. If this fails, throw rocks in the animal&#8217;s direction.</span></li>
<li><span></span><span>If a coyote attacks a person, immediately contact the nearest Department of Fish and Wildlife or law enforcement office.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In addition to coyotes, UC Santa Cruz is home to mountain lions, snakes, bats, and more. The department has more&#160;<a href="https://police.ucsc.edu/services/animal.html">information online</a>&#160;about living, studying, and working around campus wildlife.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>UC Santa Cruz Police Department</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="11f1a1a5807270460992605b168ad0f0"><name>hbcu-grants</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC-HBCU grants support UCSC faculty collaborations with HBCUs</title><summary>A summer research program and a historical archaeology course won funding from a UC initiative to support partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities.</summary><keywords>Phil Crews, J.

<p>Phil Crews, a distinguished research professor of chemistry, will lead the UCSC-HBCU Network for Success in the Chemical/Biological Sciences, a program offering summer research experience at UCSC for HBCU undergraduates. In the other program, Anthropology Professor J. Cameron Monroe is teaming up with UC Berkeley Assistant Professor William White, III, to offer a short summer course in African diaspora archaeology for HBCU students, followed by archaeological fieldwork at sites in the Caribbean and West Africa.</p>
<p>Black students have long been underrepresented in graduate and professional programs across the University of California. To help address this disparity, the UC-HBCU Initiative offers mentoring and research experiences to prepare HBCU undergraduates for graduate school and connects students with opportunities for continuing their academic journeys through the UC system.</p>
<p>&#8220;These programs are fantastic because they have at their foundation partnerships between HBCUs and UC campuses,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;Building stronger connections between UCSC and HBCUs helps to broaden the pathways by which HBCU students enter top graduate programs, including ours, setting them up for future success, perhaps as faculty themselves in the physical, biological and social sciences.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Unearthing a passion for archaeology</h2>
<p>In this latest round of UC-HBCU grants, a summer archaeology program that has been led by UC Santa Cruz Anthropology Professor J. Cameron Monroe since 2018 received three more years of funding to build upon its prior successes. Five HBCU students per year will begin the program with a visit to the UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley campuses for an intensive introductory course focused on the archaeology of slavery and the African diaspora. Then, they&#8217;ll apply what they&#8217;ve learned during six weeks of field work at archaeological sites in St. Croix and Benin.</p>
<p>Conducting research at both sites will offer an unparalleled opportunity to approach African diaspora archaeology from a transatlantic perspective. Monroe says most archaeologists who work on questions about slavery or African diaspora either focus on West Africa or on plantations in the Caribbean or the Americas, and they come from different disciplinary backgrounds and training, which can result in missed opportunities for sharing knowledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this program, we're going to be creating scholars who are truly thinking about these issues from both sides,&#8221; Monroe explained. &#8220;They will have dug at a rural village site in Africa and at a plantation slave quarter, and they&#8217;ll be making important connections about the similarities and differences from the beginning. Hopefully that will transform the way that they approach things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Monroe and White will teach the classroom portion of the program, and Monroe will lead the field work in Benin, while research in St. Croix will be led by White, UCLA Assistant Professor Justin Dunnovant, and Stanford University Assistant Professor Ayana Omilade Flewellen.</p>
<p>While many UC campuses offer archaeology programs through their anthropology departments, Monroe says HBCUs traditionally do not have dedicated archaeology programs. However, many HBCU students have strong academic backgrounds and research skills in Africana studies, African diaspora history and culture, or African languages. Monroe hopes these students will consider archaeology as another possible means of studying the African diaspora, and the summer program may even help some to unearth a new passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students get out in the field at these archaeological sites, and their eyes are opened to a whole new approach to thinking about the past,&#8221; Monroe said. &#8220;They&#8217;re holding an object in their hands, and their minds start spinning with questions about who made it, what it represents, and how it may have helped people to make the best of their lives under oppressive conditions. It&#8217;s wonderful to see students fall in love with archaeology, and we&#8217;ve been able to bring some brilliant people into this discipline who might not otherwise have ended up there.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Building community in the sciences</h2>
<p>Crews said his new HBCU program will build on the success of the ACCESS program, which he has directed since 1994. ACCESS is an academic bridge program for community college students interested in pursuing a career in the biosciences, offering enrichment activities, a Summer Research Institute, and other opportunities to acquire knowledge and skills that will increase their transfer eligibility and academic success.</p>
<p>The new program will bring a select group of students from HBCUs to UC Santa Cruz for summer research internships. After the students return to their home campuses, they will continue collaborative projects in the physical and biological sciences, working with UCSC and HBCU faculty.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the summer, they will live on campus in the same environment as the ACCESS students, so they will be joining this community of scholars that we&#8217;ve been building for 28 years,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;The idea is to take the successful mechanisms and lessons learned in ACCESS and import them into this HBCU program.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;UCSC-HBCU research fellows&#8221; will be students who have completed two or three academic years and are interested in pursuing an advanced degree in the chemical or biological sciences. They will be invited to return in subsequent years to continue their research at UCSC, and will receive mentoring and support as they apply to graduate schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want them to come back to UCSC as graduate students,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;The excitement for this grant is huge. We&#8217;ve had so few African-American Ph.D. students on Science Hill over the years, and I think this is going to make a difference. This grant will enable us to start fixing what has been a leaky pipeline.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program&#8217;s leadership team includes UCSC co-principal investigators Theodore Holman, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and Marilou Sison&#8209;Mangus, associate research professor of ocean sciences, as well as faculty at four HBCUs&#8212;Norfolk State University in Virginia, North Carolina Central University, Fisk University in Tennessee, and Hampton University in Virginia. The participating students will have mentors at both UCSC and their HBCUs, and the interactions will continue through the academic year.</p>
<p>Crews said the program will also help the HBCU faculty in terms of their professional development through interactions with UCSC faculty and with each other. &#8220;The faculty we work with at the community colleges in the ACCESS program have built lasting relationships&#8212;they talk to each other all the time now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We will bring at least one of the HBCU faculty here each year to serve as a liaison, and we hope to get funding to have more of them spend time with us at UCSC.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="12e7331d807270460992605bc34cb8bf"><name>ucsc-igem-2022-team-intro</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC iGEM developing yeast-based type 2 diabetes medication for 2022 international competition</title><summary>14 UCSC undergraduates are addressing access and cost of Type 2 diabetes medications by creating an alternative, yeast-based treatment that will be presented at the 2022 iGEM Jamboree in Paris. </summary><start-date>1658127600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC iGEM developing yeast-based type 2 diabetes medication for 2022 international competition</display-name><path>/2022/07/ucsc-igem-2022-team-intro</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/07/ucsc-igem-2022-team-intro</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1658174518019</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1658180001177</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa Weckerle</name><title></title><phone/><email>mweckerl@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/igem2022.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/igem2022.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>igem2022.jpeg</name><display-name>igem2022.jpeg</display-name><file-size>88911</file-size><width>512</width><height>341</height></image><image-alt>2022 UCSC iGEM team</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/cropped-image.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/cropped-image.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cropped-image.jpg</name><display-name>cropped-image.jpg</display-name><file-size>15213</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>2022 UCSC iGEM Team</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>2022 UCSC iGEM team photo</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just three months remaining until the International Genetically Engineering Machine (iGEM) Jamboree in Paris, France, the 2022 UC Santa Cruz iGEM team is making steady progress on their project: an alternative treatment for Type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition that affects the body&#8217;s ability to regulate blood sugar and the 7th leading cause of death globally. Their project addresses the high costs and limited availability of diabetes medication with a yeast-based treatment, which would allow underserved populations around the world to grow and access the medicine locally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year, a new team of UCSC undergraduates participating in iGEM chooses a synthetic biology project that aims to solve a pressing global health issue and joins hundreds of other teams from universities around the world in a global competition. The UCSC team is advised by David Bernick, associate teaching professor of biomolecular engineering (BME), and receiving additional support and mentorship from UCSC Ph.D. student and TA Eric Malekos and Hartnell College intern Gabino Guzman.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After forming in December 2021, the team&#8217;s first priority was to identify a project that was both viable and addressed a pressing global health challenge.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We asked team members which project, out of four total, they thought would be the most feasible and would be able to make a substantial impact,&#8221; said Elizabeth Beer, BME student and one of this year&#8217;s captains. &#8220;At the end, we had consensus on moving forward with the diabetes treatment idea.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals eat, glucagon-like-peptide-1s (GLP1s) are naturally secreted in response to the rise in blood glucose levels. The secretion of GLP1s causes a cascade effect, which ultimately leads to the release of insulin to regulate blood sugar.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People living with Type 2 diabetes either lack insulin sensitivity or resist insulin. A class of medication currently used to treat Type 2 diabetes is called GLP1 RA, glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists. GLP1 RA medications mimic the binding that occurs between GLP1 and its receptor in the body and have longer half lives. This allows for GLP1 RAs to be an attractive and effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;GLP1 RAs are really effective for people with Type 2 diabetes because their issue is insulin sensitivity, not necessarily insulin production,&#8221; said Kiana Imani, a BME student and team co-captain. &#8220;GLP1 RAs are at the forefront of Type 2 diabetes treatment, but are wildly expensive and not easily accessible in many parts of the world, with underserved populations most affected. Our team&#8217;s focus is to develop an inexpensive and naturally derived treatment to address the high cost and limited accessibility of diabetes medication.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GLP1 RAs are naturally-derived peptides and can be produced naturally within a plant host, an organism that houses a smaller organism, such as soybeans, yeast, or microalgae&#8212;all organisms that the team has considered employing for their project because of their ability to grow fast and be manipulated at the genetic level.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to find a host or multiple hosts that allows us to prove our concept within the relatively short timeline of our project,&#8221; said Gia Balius, human biology student and UCSC iGEM team member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This summer, team UCSC is working in the lab daily. Wet lab work will begin soon as they bring their project to the test phase. The team is divided into four focuses: host development, plasmid design, human impact, and wiki (documentation).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The host-finding group is researching organisms, like yeast or microalgae, to create a bio-encapsulated version of the medication. The plasmid design group will work on inserting the bioengineered gene into the host organism. Plasmids are small DNA structures in the cells of bacteria that have the ability to self-replicate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The human impact group is connecting with diabetes patients, doctors, and other health professionals to learn more about how their approach can help those that are most impacted by the limited availability and high cost of diabetes medication. The wiki group is building the team&#8217;s website, where they will share weekly updates, lab notes, resources, and any other information about their project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our team structure is completely horizontal; we&#8217;re all equal in the lab and have the freedom to experiment,&#8221; Imani explained. &#8220;We&#8217;re also given a lot of creative freedom from Profesor Bernick, which allows us to get a ton of hands-on experience and learn new concepts by doing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The past two UCSC iGEM teams won gold at the annual iGEM Jamboree. Team </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progenie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which designed a system to target and eliminate a toxic gene found in Shiga toxin-producing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. coli</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;a family of bacteria responsible for some of the most severe forms of food poisoning&#8212;won in 2021. And the 2020 team earned gold for developing a cellulose-based biodegradable plastic for strawberry growers called </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Komaplastics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that breaks down into glucose monomers that the microbes in soil can use as nutrients and allows farmers to till the plastic into the soil at the end of the growing season, keeping it out of landfills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 iGEM competition will be held October 26&#8211;28 in Paris, France. This will be the first time in three years that team UCSC will be traveling to the competition.

(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>An outreach program to bring science and scientists into K-12 classrooms is part of a study investigating the differences between male and female elephant seals</article-subhead><article-text><p>As young elephant seals grow up, males and females diverge dramatically in their size, diets, migration patterns, and even how likely they are to survive. A new research project led by Roxanne Beltran, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, is investigating how the increasing size differences in developing elephant seals relate to differences in their behavior and in the perils they face at sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know little about how elephant seals and other wild animals die&#8212;whether they get eaten by predators or aren&#8217;t able to find enough food&#8212;and the consequences are huge for understanding the patterns we see in nature,&#8221; Beltran said.</p>
<p>Her new project is funded by a four-year, $1.2 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). This spring, Beltran&#8217;s team outfitted 32 juvenile elephant seals with a newly developed &#8220;biologger,&#8221; a sophisticated tracking device that records each seal&#8217;s diving behavior, migration route, and feeding success and transmits the data back to the researchers via satellite. Even if a seal dies during its months-long foraging migration, Beltran and her colleagues will have detailed information about its life at sea.</p>
<p>Co-principal investigator Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, and other UCSC researchers have been studying the elephant seals at A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve for decades, using increasingly sophisticated tagging technology to track their migrations and study their behavior at sea. Tags that transmit data via satellites are not new, but older ones were limited in the amount of data they could transmit. While scientists could track migration routes in real time, they couldn&#8217;t get detailed data on feeding behavior until they recovered the tags after the seals returned to the beach at A&#241;o Nuevo.</p>
<p>The tags are also expensive, so they have been used mostly to track adult seals, which return to A&#241;o Nuevo with greater reliability than juveniles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Historically, young seals have been underrepresented in tracking studies,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;Juveniles tend to have high mortality rates, and juvenile males are the worst if you want to get your instruments and data back. But these new tags make it worthwhile to tag juvenile males so we can find out why they have higher mortality rates than females.&#8221;</p>
<p>While female elephant seals travel great distances in the open ocean during their foraging migrations, males tend to forage along the coasts where prey is more concentrated, but where there is also more danger from sharks and killer whales. Scientists think the males may pursue a riskier foraging strategy because of the advantages of growing big fast&#8212;large size is a critical factor in the fierce competition between males for access to females during the breeding season.</p>
<p>Beltran&#8217;s study will provide some hard data for evaluating this hypothesis. &#8220;Our entire field has a sampling bias, because we usually only get information from the animals that survive,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;By studying the animals that don&#8217;t make it, we hope to get a better idea of what&#8217;s happening out in the ocean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beltran&#8217;s team is also launching an interactive animal tracking website for students and the public, and they will be visiting K-12 classrooms to engage students throughout the Monterey Bay region. In addition to Beltran, the outreach team is led by three other members of her research team, graduate students Salma Abdel-Raheem, Dan Palance, and Allison Payne.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a great opportunity for students in the local area to be exposed to this exciting elephant seal science and to the scientists who work with these amazing animals,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;We can visit up to 32 classrooms this fall, and each classroom will be able to follow an individual seal that we&#8217;ve tagged.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NSF research funding does not cover these outreach efforts, however, so Beltran is looking for donors to sponsor the classroom visits. Donations will cover travel expenses for the outreach team and classroom materials. More information is available on the team&#8217;s <a href="https://crowdfund.ucsc.edu/project/32356">crowdfunding page</a>.</p>
<p>Interested teachers can apply for a classroom visit using an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhdC9ywjetqYy0ZpPoLCXVj9eqQ3H0SZGMR4Rrf4hIutySZg/viewform">online form</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more donations we get, the more students we can reach,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;With small contributions from enough donors, we hope to inspire around 1,000 students each year.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="174648a4807270460992605b147c27e2"><name>kim-cell-reports</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Hallmark cancer gene regulates RNA ‘dark matter’</title><summary>A new study finds that a key genetic mutation that occurs early on in cancer alters RNA “dark matter” and causes the release of previously unknown RNA biomarkers for cancer early detection.&#13;

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Researchers examined the effects of mutations in the KRAS gene, which is among the most frequently mutated genes across all cancers, including pancreatic, lung, and colorectal cancers. KRAS is thought to be an initial &#8220;driver&#8221; mutation that leads to cancer formation, making it essential for understanding and detecting cancer at its earliest stages.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this study, Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Daniel Kim&#8217;s lab focused on KRAS mutations in lung cancer to determine their effects on RNA &#8220;dark matter,&#8221; which is generated from 75% of the 3 billion base pairs in the human genome, with the goal of discovering new RNA biomarkers for cancer early detection.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The sooner you detect that someone has cancer, the more likely they will be to survive through treatment and surgery,&#8221; said Kim, who is affiliated with the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, the Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells, the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA, and is an Associate Member of the Canary Center at Stanford for Cancer Early Detection. &#8220;Millions of people die from cancer every year around the world, and there is an urgent need to develop highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests that enable cancer early detection, before it has spread to other parts of the body.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kim&#8217;s lab studies how the KRAS gene regulates the transcriptome, all of the RNA produced in a cell. RNA&#8217;s most commonly recognized function is as a &#8220;messenger&#8221; that takes the encoded genetic information in DNA and converts this into protein, but recent advances in genomics have revealed that the vast majority of RNA is noncoding and does not make protein. Kim&#8217;s lab focuses on researching this noncoding RNA, with the goal of using this information to better understand the formation of cancer and to identify new biomarkers for cancer early detection.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this study, led by Kim lab Ph.D. candidate in biomolecular engineering and National Institutes of Health F99/K00 fellow Roman Reggiardo, researchers found that KRAS mutations in lung cancers also activate interferon-stimulated genes, something that is seen in many cancers but the cause of which has been unclear.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They also determined that mutations in KRAS cause the silencing of a class of genes called KRAB zinc finger genes, something that, according to Kim, has not been seen before in the context of cancer. When these genes are turned off, certain types of noncoding RNAs are aberrantly activated. Many of these newly activated noncoding RNAs are derived from transposable elements, which are repetitive elements found in the millions throughout the human genome, some of which have the potential to &#8220;jump&#8221; around the genome and alter it.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The researchers found that not only are these transposable element RNAs turned on within mutant KRAS cells, they are also transported outside of the cells. Given that RNAs are known to be released from cancer cells into the bloodstream, these transposable element RNAs may act as a signal of cancer-causing mutant KRAS that can be detected in the blood through RNA sequencing.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kim believes that this strong, robust RNA signature is very promising for diagnosing cancer in its earliest stages. This could be done with a blood test known as a &#8220;liquid biopsy,&#8221; a minimally invasive approach compared to a traditional tumor tissue biopsy.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">These newly published results were found through the use of cell culture models, where the researchers introduced mutant KRAS into non-cancerous lung cells, pushing them into a cancerous state. They performed RNA sequencing using several different techniques and performed computational analysis to determine which RNA was more prevalent in cells expressing mutant KRAS versus control cells.&#160;</span></p>

</figure>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">The researchers performed additional epigenomic profiling experiments, which look at how genes are turned on or off without changes to the DNA sequence itself. They also performed extracellular vesicle isolations, identifying which RNAs are packaged into extracellular vesicles and preferentially secreted from cancerous cells affected by mutant KRAS.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other labs who contributed to this study include Associate Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Angela Brooks&#8217; lab, Stanford Professor of Radiology Utkan Demirci&#8217;s lab, UCSF Professor of Medicine Eric Collisson&#8217;s lab, and Jason Fernandes from Professor of Biomolecular Engineering David Haussler&#8217;s lab.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We were in an interdisciplinary environment that really encouraged us to think about RNA and cancer in a different way,&#8221; first-author Reggiardo said.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In ongoing and future work, the Kim lab aims to further confirm their novel results by analyzing blood samples from lung cancer patients to validate that their newly identified RNA signatures are present in these patients. This will be done in conjunction with their Stanford Canary Center colleague Utkan Demirci and others at Stanford through a collaborative grant from the Department of Defense. They hope to develop a test that could detect these RNA signatures as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of lung cancer.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additionally, they anticipate that the methods developed in this study could be used as a framework for developing an RNA liquid biopsy platform for multi-cancer early detection.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>

Best known for producing the U.S.&#8217;s longest-running daytime soap opera, &#8220;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_of_Our_Lives"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days of Our Lives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Corday is a nine-time daytime Emmy nominated producer and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With intent to make a lasting impact on UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s music department and students, Corday established </span><strong>The Kenneth R. Corday Family Chair in Music for Film, Television, Emerging Media, and Multimedia Collaboration</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in late June. This generous and transformational gift will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used to provide the appointed chair holder a scholarly allowance to support teaching, research, and service in music for film, television, and media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corday graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a Bachelor of Arts in Music/Aesthetic Studies in 1975 and a Master&#8217;s degree in Music Composition from San Jose State University (SJSU) in 1977. He said that his music education at UCSC was instrumental for his work as a television producer, and wants to uplift current students pursuing similar careers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Once you&#8217;ve achieved a certain level of proficiency and professionalism in the world and have had the wherewithal to be charitable, your first look should be to the people that got you where you&#8217;re going or where you are,&#8221; Corday said. &#8220;</span><strong>I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am today had I not gone to UC Santa Cruz and had not gone on to graduate school. So it&#8217;s time for me to give back</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing the Corday Family Chair in Music is not the first time Corday has chosen to support the Arts at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, Corday established the </span><strong>Kenneth R. Corday Family Presidential Chair in Writing for Television and Film</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dedicated to theater and new media arts education at UCSC. In celebration of the Corday Family Chair in Writing for Television and Film, Corday returned to UCSC on May 20 to attend an investiture ceremony which announced Yiman Wang as the incoming chairholder, celebrated outgoing chairholder Rick Prelinger, and honored the generosity and legacy of Ken Corday.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Corday family&#8217;s transformative gift has helped fund multiple film classes at UCSC, such as Professional Topics in Film, Writing about Film, Television &amp; Media, and Understanding Media.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the Arts Division looks forward to Corday-funded projects that will drop this year: a series of lectures in memory of late arts professor Jonathan Kahana, visits by emerging Native American writers and producers, planning and development of a granting program for very recent alums, and curricular innovation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean of the Division of the Arts, Celine </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parre&#241;as Shimizu, expressed excitement and gratitude for Corday&#8217;s long-standing support of the Arts at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Kenneth R. Corday Family Presidential Chair in Writing for Television and Film will benefit forever generations of UCSC faculty and students forever with vital resources to tell new, inclusive, stories that transform our society,&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parre&#241;as Shimizu said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ith the announcement of yet another endowed chair, this time in Music, the Arts has another opportunity to honorably shepherd Mr. Corday and his family&#8217;s legacy at UCSC, his beloved alma mater. When the giver emanates the happiness that comes from giving, we behold the resulting joy in our community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outgoing Corday Family Chair in Writing for Television and Film, Rick Prelinger, emphasized the impacts the Corday Family funds have had on the film department and the programs made available to students as a result of Corday&#8217;s gift.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Corday Family funds have helped Film and Digital Media create many new opportunities for students,&#8221; Prelinger said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve brought film and television writers, producers, directors, and artists into classes to share their ideas, skills, and careers with students. We&#8217;ve increased the number of writing classes we offer. We&#8217;re creating opportunities for our graduate students to write and publish. We&#8217;re working on evolving our curriculum to better serve students as they prepare to enter the rapidly evolving media industries. And we look forward to doing much more.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prelinger added that his research has dramatically benefited from the Corday family&#8217;s generosity, utilizing Corday research funds for archival film scanning and editing for his recent film &#8220;Earth, Fire, Air, Water: California Infrastructures.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corday, a longtime leader in television drama, is dedicated to preparing students for the industry and wants to do so through UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s so much competition in the TV and film business, and there&#8217;s not a propensity to train young writers and producers in film and television,&#8221; Corday said. &#8220;So I wanted to establish the [Corday] Chair to develop talent here for the industry. How do we prepare students for what we call &#8216;the jump&#8217;&#8212;jumping out of college and into the professional world. It&#8217;s daunting, and it&#8217;s the reason why I established the Chair.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Ken Corday at UCSC&#160;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corday attended UC Santa Cruz in its early years, with a population of under 2,500 students and a music department in its infancy. Upon visiting UCSC almost five decades after graduating, Corday said the campus looked like an entirely different university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s mind-blowing because none of this was here 50 years ago,&#8221; Corday said. &#8220;It&#8217;s so satisfying, wonderful, and inspiring to see what&#8217;s happened with music here and with the music buildings. I think the student body is extremely fortunate. Not only to have this paradise to live and study on but the great facility that it has become.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a student, Corday took jazz, music composition, and songwriting classes with music professor and UCSC alumnus Randy Masters both at UCSC and at SJSU. Masters said that Corday was one of his most accomplished and gifted students.&#160; &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ken was just a wonderful student completely, and he was just a gem to work with,&#8221; Masters said. &#8220;He was very talented, and I knew he was on a professional path by the different things that he did. Even as a student, he had that laid out ahead of him; he was on that path.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corday&#8217;s advice to current film and music students at UC Santa Cruz? &#8220;Be fearless.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to say it sounds altruistic, but be fearless,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t second guess yourself, ever. Don&#8217;t let someone else tell you how to do it&#8212;do it your way. Keep knocking on the door, and if you have to knock 999 times, that&#8217;s okay. Because maybe on the 1,000th time, the door will open, and when that door opens, go through it prepared with full confidence that you&#8217;re going to do what no one&#8217;s done before.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Days of Our Lives&#160;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first episode of &#8220;Days of Our Lives&#8221; aired on NBC on Nov. 8, 1965, under the direction of Ken Corday&#8217;s parents, Ted and Betty Corday. The show quickly became a household hit following the usual soap opera threads of love, marriage, divorce, and family life. By 1975, the series was so successful the 30-minute episodes were expanded to 60 minutes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 14,000 episodes later, &#8220;Days of Our Lives&#8221; is the longest-running daytime soap opera in the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Days of Our Lives will be 58 this November, and I think 60 is very possible,&#8221; Corday said. &#8220;I&#8217;m very proud to have been able to carry on the legacy that my father created when he created the show, and then my mother, extremely strong-willed and farsighted, took it and made it a hit.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When his father passed, Corday&#8217;s mother ran &#8220;Days of Our Lives&#8221; as a single woman and quickly became a Hollywood leader and trailblazer. Corday said &#8220;Days of Our Lives&#8221; is his family&#8217;s legacy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The television drama still airs on NBC and was recently renewed for two more seasons, extending the series to 2023. Corday hopes he will be able to continue a legacy of social transformation through the show and push the boundaries of daytime television.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At UCSC we know that we have not yet unleashed the power of art until all are uplifted, enabled and supported,&#8221; Dean of the Division of Arts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To engage the pain and suffering inflicted by institutions is an act of resistance undertaken so as to transform these institutions&#8212;whether of media or education. This is what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days of Our Lives</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does, and what we do here in the Arts at UC Santa Cruz. And this is why Ken Corday represents the best of us!&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="188a9aa3807270460992605b79b62d3a"><name>alumni-council</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Meet UC Santa Cruz's 2023 alumni council</title><summary>Dedicating over two decades of service as an alumni volunteer, John Madrid (Oakes ’98, language studies) will now step into the role of alumni council president.

His work through the alumni council has helped reconnect alumni with each other and their university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now as the newly appointed president of UCSC&#8217;s alumni council, along with seven newly appointed councilors, Madrid and his team will continue to foster meaningful connections with fellow alumni and work towards their goals of ramping up UCSC alumni engagement around the globe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am extremely honored and humbled to be the next president of the alumni council,&#8221; Madrid said. &#8220;I am excited and grateful to get to work with the alumni engagement office and an incredibly talented and committed group of alumni councilors.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madrid previously served on the alumni council, the governing board of the UCSC alumni association from 2007 to 2014, and rejoined the council in 2019. He most recently served as the Executive Vice President. Madrid has also chaired the nominations committee, served on the scholarship committee, and the chancellor&#8217;s advisory council on campus climate, culture and inclusion from 2010 to 2012</span><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current Alumni Council President Meredith Vivian Turner will continue to serve on the executive committee stepping into the role of past president, as Madrid took on the role of president as of July 1.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I'm thrilled to see John as the next council president,&#8221; Vivian Turner said. &#8220;His many years of service on the council, combined with his thoughtful, even-keeled disposition, will serve the board and campus well as we collectively work to elevate the role and impact of alumni.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madrid said he enjoys giving back to the campus that helped to shape his life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I just had such a great experience at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Madrid said. &#8220;I very much had an affinity for the school and the campus, and volunteering really is a way for me to give back to the university.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madrid graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1998 with a B.A. in language studies and returned to the Los Angeles area, where he grew up. After a couple of years, he found himself drawn to UCSC&#8217;s Los Angeles regional chapter, which hosted dozens of events in the LA area. He soon started volunteering with the chapter in 2002, and was elected Treasurer of the LA chapter in 2004.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since graduating from UCSC, Madrid has worked in the information technology field for multiple financial institutions in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Currently, Madrid is the Assistant Vice President of Information Technology for American Business Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Santa Cruz is a very special place, and the people are special as well,&#8221; Madrid said. &#8220;I get to be in connection with both the campus and the people, and that symbiotic relationship is what makes me want to do volunteer work.&#8221;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is grateful for the Alumni Councilors leadership and support.

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz alumni Florence Nelson, Stephen Klein,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and Nadene Thorne are at the forefront of volunteering at Cowell College. With the goal of setting the foundation for reunions and volunteering at the college, the trio worked together to put on Cowell College&#8217;s 50th reunion for the class of 1972 in April of 2022. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"As members of one of the earliest classes to graduate from Cowell, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we felt a responsibility to help establish traditions,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;We are laying the groundwork for what an alumni relationship with the campus could look like because there wasn't a definition of it when we started at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelson (Cowell &#8217;72, psychology) graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1972 with a B.A. in psychology and numerous anthropology courses under her belt. While at the university, she worked as a records clerk in the Cowell office, emphasizing that her connection to the college went beyond being a student. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from UCSC, Nelson moved to the east coast and became involved with the New York alumni regional chapter. Since moving back to California she has assisted with organizing multiple reunions and other alumni outreach events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some people are really attached to their high school experience and some people are really attached to something else,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;For me, the time I spent at Cowell was really formative for me and helped me establish a way of looking at the world through a cultural lens as well as an academic lens.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the organizing of Cowell&#8217;s 50th reunion where Nelson, Klein and Thorne&#160; (Cowell &#8217;72, literature) worked closely together for the first time, but their contributions to the college span beyond reunion planning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio&#8217;s connection to the university spans decades, and their intent to support current students and reconnect alumni rings clear.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In a very real way, the alumni who are active are crucial to the institutional memory of the college,&#8221;&#160; said Cowell College Provost Alan Christy. &#8220;Cowell was the first college so we have people from the very first days at UC Santa Cruz; we have an irreplaceable link to the whole history of the college. It's important to remember that college staff, administrators, and faculty come and go, but the alumni stay and it's important that we acquaint ourselves with alumni and come to understand the tremendous value that they bring.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelson, Thorne, and Klein have worked on countless projects including the creation of the Cowell Provost Academic Emergency Fund which provides students with emergency financial support, and gathering readers for Cowell College&#8217;s John Dizikes Writing Prize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have students who are food insecure, housing insecure, students finding themselves suddenly in a position where they can't afford textbooks, or something of that nature, and these are the kinds of things that can really impact their success at UCSC,&#8221; Thorne said.&#160; &#8220;So if students need $100 here or $200 there, it's at the provost&#8217;s discretion as to who receives this money.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klein (Cowell &#8217;72, religious studies) was asked to run for the alumni council soon after graduating from UCSC, and found himself presented with opportunities to make an impact on students&#8217; experience at the university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I went to Santa Cruz, the fees were $119.50 a quarter, and a year at Santa Cruz for someone who lived on campus would be about $2,000,&#8221; Klein said. &#8220;Well, clearly the fees are not $119.50 anymore, and it is certainly more than $2,000 a year to go to school.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a member of the alumni council in the &#8217;90s, Klein worked to launch the Alumni Association Scholarship Fund to support students with the growing cost of higher education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those facts resonated with alums and people started supporting this scholarship fund very generously because it seemed like a good idea,&#8221; Klein said. &#8220;It seemed like something that people could do to support the university that had been so important to them.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowell provost Alan Christy said he is grateful to Nelson, Thorne, and Klein for their longstanding support of the college and the university as whole.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It's been great for the students to see active alumni who are interested in learning what students' current situations are like and thinking about how they can be of help to them,&#8221; Christy said. &#8220;It's nice to be able to point to their active engagement in the college and talk to students about their relationship with the university being something that's potentially lifelong.&#8221;</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">M</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">any UC Santa Cruz alumni, faculty and staff, and community supporters have chosen to include the university in their estate plan.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">planned gift can serve as a way to unite philanthropic and financial goals. </span><strong><i>Find out more about how you can support UC Santa Cruz with </i></strong><a href="https://plannedgifts.ucsc.edu/"><strong><i>planned gifts.&#160;</i></strong></a></h4>
<h2><strong>Alumni Weekend 2023</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Alumni Weekend 2023 approaches, UCSC&#8217;s Alumni Engagement team has been hard at work to bring a fresh look to the weeklong celebrations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A decades-long tradition, Alumni Weekend was created to welcome alumni back to UC Santa Cruz to reconnect with peers, Santa Cruz, and the campus community. The week-long series of events typically consisted of campus tours, reunions, lectures, and celebrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the traditional program will be transformed into two separate weekend events in the spring and summertime. In April, UCSC will host Alumni Reunion Weekend celebrating alumni who graduated 50+ years ago. Then, in August, the University will offer &#8220;Return to the Redwoods,&#8221; a first-of-its-kind residential campus experience where alumni will be able to stay overnight in residential halls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a modernized and re-envisioned program, organizers aim to provide a more meaningful way for alumni to engage in the coming years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This change has been a long time coming,&#8221; says Assistant Vice Chancellor of Alumni Engagement John Pine. &#8220;Alumni Weekend, in its previous iteration, has been successful in welcoming back a portion of our alumni. However, with this reimagined version of Alumni Weekend, we tried to really listen to what alumni have been asking for.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p><strong><a id="howmade"></a>How are housing assignments made?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students are assigned off the waitlist based on rooms available and the type of room a student has requested. When looking at roommate compatibility, housing coordinators will do their best to make good matches based on what is listed on the student's housing application. We have some tips on what makes a good housing application!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there isn't an available room of the type you requested, best efforts will be made to&#160; try to offer you alternative housing. However, assignments will first be made for students who have&#160; requested available room types before providing&#160; alternative offers to students who have requested room types that are not available. For example:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Student A and Student B both want a residence hall large triple, but Student B has also listed a residence hall triple, and there are no residence hall large triples available, Student B will be assigned to the available regular triple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After every student who requested a residence hall triple on their housing application is assigned and there are leftover spaces,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only then</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will alternative &#160; housing offers be provided to those students who did not request the available&#160; room type like Student A.</span></p>
<p><strong><a id="chances"></a>What are my chances of getting housing?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We remain committed to offering students housing assignments that align with their preferences. Because of this, it is often hard to answer this question. Demand for housing is high and far exceeds remaining availability. The type of housing a student prefers can impact the chances of receiving a housing assignment or alternate housing offer. The more flexible you are in your housing options, the greater your chance of being assigned housing. The most common room types still available are in residence hall triples. If this accommodation type is not among your preferences, consider returning to the </span><a href="https://studenthousing.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing Portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to update the room preferences listed in your housing application.</span></p>
<p><strong><a id="place"></a>What is my place on the waitlist?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because we are committed to offering students housing assignments that align with their preferences, this question is hard to answer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The waitlist is </span><strong>NOT</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a numbered list and does not work as such. The length of the waitlist correlates to the number of students wanting housing on campus.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Students are assigned off this list based on what spaces are available and how well </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched that space is to preferences indicated by the student, including consideration of compatibility with other roommates/housemates.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong><a id="time"></a>Why can&#8217;t those on the general waitlist know whether they will or won&#8217;t receive housing before the end of the academic year?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From start to finish, the UC Santa Cruz housing assignment process centers students&#8217; preferences (e.g., single versus double versus triple rooms). Because of this, after the selection window closes for priority students, the remainder of the assignment process is completed manually by staff members. Staff, specifically Housing coordinators, carefully review available supply of rooms on campus and make assignments that align with students&#8217; stated preferences. This portion of the process is not automated and takes considerable time. The housing team works on these assignments from May through the start of the school year.</span></p>
<p><strong><a id="different"></a>If my preferred type of housing isn&#8217;t available, will I still be offered housing? I was offered a room type I didn't list?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best efforts are made&#160; to assign students to housing options they request when assigning off the waitlist. However, there is a finite number of each room type. If a room type you did not request becomes available, the Housing coordinator may offer you that spot. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will have </span></i><strong><i>48 hours</i></strong><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to accept. This deadline is strictly enforced.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please review your UCSC email account on a regular basis.</span></p>
<p><strong><a id="alternate"></a>I got sent an alternate housing offer. How do alternate housing offers work? Why was I offered alternate housing?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there are no spaces that match your room preferences, you will be offered a different room type. This includes rooms at other housing areas including other Colleges, the Village, and the University Town Center.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternate housing offers are made via UCSC email and require students accept the offer within </span><strong>forty-eight (48) hours </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">or the offer is void and the space will be offered to another student. Closely monitor your UCSC email and/or set up email forwarding to have your UCSC email forwarded to another account you check regularly. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students who do not respond during the allotted time, or decline an offer of housing, will be moved to the general waitlist and will no longer receive Priority Status for placement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were offered alternative housing, it means the housing community you applied for does not have a room that meets your requests listed in your application.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong><a id="when"></a>When will I know if I have a space available?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a student is assigned to housing, they get an automatic email titled "UCSC Housing Assignment Confirmation". That email will only contain confirmation of the assignment. Information about roommates and room placement will be sent in a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate email</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the end of August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the majority of our assignments are usually finished by mid-August, we assign students through the first week of class. We are working diligently to house as many students as possible but, regretfully, we will not be able to provide university housing for all interested students and we anticipate very little movement off of the waitlist before the start of the Fall quarter.</span></p>
<p><strong><a id="increase"></a>How can I increase my chances of getting housing?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;">
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark or flag housing emails as Important/VIP/etc. on your phone and in your email.&#160;</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The housing emails will be sent primarily from </span><a href="mailto:housing@ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing@ucsc.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the email address of the housing community you applied to.</span></p>
</li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, mark the "Housing Application acknowledgment" email you were sent when you applied to housing. By marking your &#8220;Housing Application Acknowledgement&#8221; email as important, your email will know to prioritize all housing emails so you are more likely to see an alternate housing offer.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;">
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opt into texts from UCSC in MyUCSC Notification Preferences. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Housing Office may text you to check your email for an alternative housing offer.</span></p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;">
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check your email daily.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you are offered an alternate housing assignment, you will have </span><strong>48 hours </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">to accept.</span></p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;">
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">List as many room types as you would be comfortable taking.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more room types you list on your housing application, the more likely it is that an available room will match your preference increasing the likelihood of an assignment.</span></p>
</li>

<p><strong><a id="priority"></a>Why don&#8217;t I have priority?&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Priority housing eligibility is determined by a number of factors. </span><a href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/prioritygroups/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This housing priority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page explains the housing priority criteria and requirements for 2022-2023.</span></p>
<p><strong><a id="office"></a>I haven't heard anything from the Housing Office. Does this mean I won't get housing?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven't heard from us, it means you are still on the waitlist and that you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don't have housing. There is more information about the Waitlist and when you may learn about your housing on this FAQ.</span></p>
<p><strong><a id="enrollment"></a>Why does enrollment at UCSC increase while housing is in short supply?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enrollment is holding steady at UCSC. Due to the limited supply of housing&#8211;on campus and in the Santa Cruz area&#8211;we are carefully managing our student enrollment. We are working&#160; to hold enrollment steady at the current rates until additional housing is available.</span></p>
<p><strong><a id="remote"></a>With housing in short supply why are more remote learning opportunities not made available?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the pandemic necessitated use of remote learning modalities, in-person learning remains the primary mode of instruction at UC Santa Cruz. We believe in-person learning provides the best opportunity for learning, development, and transformation.</span></p>

<p>The plant, also known as a titan arum <em>(Amorphophallus titanum)</em>, has been growing for the past decade in the UCSC Greenhouses and is now flowering for the first time. Its inflorescence, which will bear hundreds of small flowers, is already nearly five feet tall and growing several inches every day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting a lot of people coming to see it already, because it&#8217;s magnificent even now while it&#8217;s still developing,&#8221; said Arboretum Director Martin Quigley. &#8220;It won&#8217;t be fully open and stinky for a few more days, but we can&#8217;t say for sure whether it will be three days or six or eight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Updates and photos are being posted regularly on the Arboretum&#8217;s <a href="https://arboretum.ucsc.edu/">website</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UCSCArboretum/">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>When it opens, the corpse flower emits an odor like that of rotting flesh, attracting flies and beetles that pollinate the flowers. The flowers are borne on a tall, thick spike called a &#8220;spadix&#8221; that rises from a large, bowl-shaped bract or &#8220;spathe&#8221; colored a deep magenta red on the inside. The spadix warms up to 99 &#176;F, which helps to disperse its pungent odor far and wide.</p>
<p>The stinky bloom of the corpse flower lasts for about 24 hours after it opens, and then the whole inflorescence collapses. It usually begins opening in the late afternoon or evening, and the Arboretum will remain open until 11 p.m. on the night that it happens.</p>
<p>The titan arum is endemic to the tropical forests of Sumatra in Indonesia, and the plants are endangered in the wild as a result of deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;The individual plants are very sparse and widely separated in the forests, so the stench is a mechanism to attract pollinators over long distances,&#8221; Quigley said.</p>
<p>The Arboretum&#8217;s plant was started from seed at UC Davis and came to UCSC in 2012, where it has been cared for by Jim Velzy and Sylvie Childress, the former and current directors of the UCSC Greenhouses, who maintained it in a tropical environment in the greenhouse facilities. Each year, the plant has grown a single large leaf, storing energy in an underground stem called a corm. The corm has to grow to about 35 pounds before the plant will bloom.</p>
<p>More than a week ago, when UCSC&#8217;s titan arum looked like it was getting ready to bloom soon, it was moved to the Arboretum, where visitors will find it in the patio between the Horticulture buildings. Temporary signs direct visitors from the parking lot to the corpse flower.</p>
<p>The entrance to the UCSC Arboretum &amp; Botanic Garden is located on the east side of High Street about 1/2 mile past the main campus entrance (use the address &#8220;1 Arboretum Road&#8221; for GPS and mobile routing devices). The gardens are open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. More information about visiting the UCSC Arboretum is available online at <a href="https://arboretum.ucsc.edu/visit/index.html">arboretum.ucsc.edu/visit</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="22d1aa73807270460992605b797c8443"><name>ratir-grb-study</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Measuring the universe with star-shattering explosions</title><summary>An international team of scientists has analyzed archive data for powerful cosmic explosions from the deaths of stars and found a new way to measure distances in the distant universe.</summary><keywords>J.

<p>Led by Maria Dainotti at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), the team includes J. Xavier Prochaska and Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, both professors of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. Prochaska and Ramirez-Ruiz contributed to the design, fabrication, and commissioning of the Reionization and Transients Infrared/Optical (RATIR) imager on the 1.5-meter telescope at the San Pedro Martir Observatory. Data from RATIR played a key role in the new study.</p>
<p>&#8220;This work makes terrific use of the RATIR telescope, a partnership between the University of California, Arizona State, and Universidad Nacional Aut&#243;noma de M&#233;xico,&#8221; Prochaska said.</p>
<p>With no landmarks in space, it is very difficult to get a sense of depth. One technique astronomers use is to look for &#8220;standard candles,&#8221; objects or events where the underlying physics dictate that the absolute brightness (what you would see if you were right next to it) is always the same. By comparing this calculated absolute brightness to the apparent brightness (what is actually observed from Earth), it is possible to determine the distance to the standard candle, and by extension other objects in the same area.</p>
<p>The lack of standard candles bright enough to be seen more than 11 billion light-years away has hindered research on the distance universe. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)&#8212;bursts of radiation produced by the deaths of massive stars&#8212;are bright enough, but their brightness depends on the characteristics of the explosion.</p>
<p>Embracing the challenge of attempting to use these bright events as standard candles, the team analyzed archived data for the visible light observations of 500 GRBs taken by world-leading telescopes, including RATIR, the Subaru Telescope (owned and operated by NAOJ), and satellites such as the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Studying the light curves showing how the GRBs brightened and dimmed over time, the team identified a class of 179 GRBs which have common features and have likely been caused by similar phenomena. From the characteristics of the light curves, the team was able to calculate a unique brightness and distance for each GRB which can be used as a cosmological tool.</p>
<p>These findings will provide new insights into the mechanics behind this class of GRBs, and provide a new standard candle for observing the distant universe. Lead author Dainotti had previously found a similar pattern in x-ray observations of GRBs, but visible light observations have been revealed to be more accurate in determining cosmological parameters.</p>
<p>These results appeared as Dainotti et al., &#8220;The Optical Two and Three-Dimensional Fundamental Plane Correlations for Nearly 180 Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows with Swift/UVOT, RATIR, and the SUBARU Telescope,&#8221; in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Supplement</em> on July 22, 2022.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="22f5ede3807270460992605b56833a35"><name>housing-update-general-waitlist</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>With limited available campus housing, UC Santa Cruz to start offering assignments to students on general wait list </title><summary>As UC Santa Cruz finishes offering campus housing to all undergraduate students on its priority waitlist, staff members are beginning to reach out to students on the general housing waitlist with offers to live in the limited, remaining residential space.</summary><start-date>1658386800000</start-date><path>/2022/07/housing-update-general-waitlist</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/07/housing-update-general-waitlist</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1658443918791</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1658443918791</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/kresge-housing-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/kresge-housing-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kresge-housing-500px.jpg</name><display-name>kresge-housing-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>152937</file-size><width>500</width><height>667</height></image><image-alt>Housing under construction at Kresge College</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Kresge College, one of UCSC&#8217;s 10 residential colleges, is undergoing a comprehensive renewal.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for on-campus housing remains extremely high and exceeds remaining availability. Unfortunately, UC Santa Cruz will not be able to offer housing assignments to every student who wishes to live on campus. Because so few on-campus housing options remain available, all students on the general waitlist are being asked to confirm off-campus housing as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We know this is disappointing and that the search for housing is stressful and time-consuming," said Sue Matthews, associate vice chancellor for Colleges, Housing and Educational Services. "We encourage students to use the campus resources that can help them find and secure off-campus housing."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz </span><a href="https://communityrentals.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Rentals Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides helpful resources for students who are looking to rent rooms, apartments, or houses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An online Renters Workshop helps students optimize their rental search and provides valuable tips for first-time renters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.places4students.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Places4Students.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rental site lists off-campus rentals in the communities surrounding UCSC. The site also invites UCSC students to create roommate profiles that can assist students in identifying like-minded individuals to join together in their search for off-campus rentals. The campus is also reaching out to local landlords, encouraging them to list their available properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus housing office is asking students who have secured off-campus housing to </span><a href="http://studenthousing.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cancel their waitlist application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so the campus can more accurately assess ongoing needs for on-campus accommodations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students with questions about the housing assignment process can find more information through a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/07/faq-campus-housing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set of answers to frequently asked questions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Students who have questions not addressed on the list, can reach out to their College Housing office for further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is committed to providing more campus housing options for its undergraduate and graduate students. The campus currently provides housing for about 9,300 students, more than half of its undergraduates.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kresge College, one of UCSC&#8217;s 10 residential colleges, is </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/07/state-funding-kresge.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">undergoing a comprehensive renewal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When the expansive project is completed, it will include housing for approximately 970 undergraduates, about 600 more beds than what the college originally held. Plans for the second phase of the Kresge construction project will be considered by the UC Board of Regents later this year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Housing West, which has been delayed by lawsuits, will enable UC Santa Cruz to offer much more housing to graduate students and upper-division undergraduates by building new housing units with space for around 3,000 students. The project, spread across two sites, will also allow the campus to expand child-care services to serve the children of faculty, staff, and students.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2308d97f807270460992605b8bbb75ee"><name>daily-symptom-check</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Daily symptom check guidance for employees</title><summary>Effective Aug. 1, the daily symptom check questionnaire will no longer be required for employees working on-site at UCSC-owned or leased facilities.</summary><start-date>1658386800000</start-date><display-name>Daily symptom check guidance for employees</display-name><path>/2022/07/daily-symptom-check</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/07/daily-symptom-check</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1658445158756</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1658445158756</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Effective Aug. 1, the daily symptom check questionnaire will no longer be required for employees working on-site at UCSC-owned or leased facilities.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2021-22 Outstanding Senior Leadership Award recognizes high-level leaders throughout the system who are supportive and inclusive of UC staff, and encourage equity, diversity and community. CUCSA, which is composed of delegates from staff assemblies across the UC system, is dedicated to improving communications between UC administrators and staff, and between staff systemwide. The award has been given annually since 2011.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m truly humbled to be recognized,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;There are so many strong, inclusive leaders throughout the UC. To be selected for this award is a great honor.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That the award is voted on by staff makes it especially meaningful, Larive added. &#8220;Staff are the foundation of our campus. To our students, they are often the face of the university. They enable so much of the research and scholarship that unfolds on our campus. They literally keep the lights on and food on the table. Their contributions to our campus are deeply valued.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders are nominated, and the award is voted on, during CUCSA&#8217;s annual spring meeting. Larive learned she had received the honor last month when Derek DeMarco, then a member of UCSC&#8217;s Staff Advisory Board, surprised her with the award at the SAB&#8217;s annual end-of-the-year luncheon. DeMarco had just wrapped up a term on CUCSA&#8217;s systemwide leadership team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeMarco, who manages the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, said he&#8217;s been impressed with Larive&#8217;s leadership. &#8220;Leaders around the system talk about supporting staff, but Cindy walks the walk,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The salary increases we&#8217;ve seen here through the staff Equity Compensation Program, for example, that&#8217;s real progress. Those increases are not something that every campus is doing. It&#8217;s a novel approach. She found a way to do something, and it has been appreciated by many.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="37256e00807270466bb04d9828146bf8"><name>kang-retirement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Steve Kang celebrates a career of seizing challenges</title><summary>As the first in his family to graduate college and in taking on positions as the second dean of the Baskin School of Engineering and chancellor of UC Merced, Sung-Mo “Steve” Kang has always been someone ready and willing to take on challenges. </summary><start-date>1658775600000</start-date><path>/2022/07/kang-retirement</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/07/kang-retirement</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1658782576092</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1661537166810</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Retirements</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/steve350.png</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/steve350.png</link><site>news</site><name>steve350.png</name><display-name>steve350.png</display-name><file-size>105639</file-size><width>350</width><height>269</height></image><image-alt>Black and white photo of Steve Kang leaning over old computers and a tangle of wires.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/steve80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/steve80.png</link><site>news</site><name>steve80.png</name><display-name>steve80.png</display-name><file-size>14975</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Black and white photo of Steve Kang leaning over old computers and a tangle of wires.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Steve Kang is renowned in the field of electrical engineering for his role in the research and development of modern microprocessors.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the first in his family to graduate college and in taking on positions as the second dean of the Baskin School of Engineering and chancellor of UC Merced, Sung-Mo &#8220;Steve&#8221; Kang has always been someone ready and willing to take on challenges.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the years, Kang has proved himself to be both an excellent scholar and administrator. He is renowned in the field of electrical engineering for his role in the research and development of modern microprocessors, holds 16 patents, has published more than 500 journal and conference papers, has co-authored ten books, and has mentored more than 60 Ph.D. students in his Nanoelectronic Integrated Systems Laboratory lab. &#8203;&#8203;Kang was the first Korean American to head a major research university.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After nearly a half-century in academia, the Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and Dean Emeritus is retiring from most of his faculty duties, and will stay on at UCSC as a professor emeritus. Kang reflects with pride on his career and the rewards of building up fledgling programs.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Early years</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Born in Yangpyong, a suburb of Seoul, Korea in 1945, the year the country gained independence from Japanese rule, Kang grew up during a time of great transition. His grandfather was an activist in the indepence movement against Japan, creating hardship for the family, and Kang grew up amidst the Korean War.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In high school, Kang liked physics and math, and felt drawn toward the intellectual and theoretical challenges of electrical engineering. He also credits his family for setting him on his path.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I received great influence from my grandfather, who said &#8220;Ay, Sung-Mo, you should study electrical engineering and go to the U.S.!&#8221; Kang said. &#8220;In a sense, I realized his dream for me.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After three years in the Korean Air Force and completing most of his undergraduate schooling at South Korea&#8217;s prestigious Yonsei University, Kang came to the U.S. in 1969 on a full scholarship to finish his bachelor&#8217;s at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey. Although he didn&#8217;t know her yet, his wife,&#160;<span>Myoung,</span> was already in the state, having also emigrated from Korea to study math and computer science at Fairleigh Dickinson University a few years before. They were married in 1972 and took their honeymoon in California, the same year Kang started his doctoral research in electrical engineering at UC Berkeley.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kang&#8217;s first job out of graduate school was an assistant professorship at Rutgers University, which he says he was lucky to obtain during a period of job shortages when even Ph.D. students were pumping gas to make ends meet. After teaching for two years, he switched to industry to do groundbreaking work at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories where he led the development of the world's first 32-bit microprocessor chips.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1985, he took a tenured professorship at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and after 10 years was elevated to the head of the electrical and computer engineering department to oversee more than 100 faculty, a program recognized as one of the best in the nation.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>A trailblazer for Baskin Engineering</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following his role as the department head at UIUC, many schools were eager to recruit Kang as their dean, but the nascent Baskin School of Engineering in scenic Santa Cruz won him over. Proximity to Silicon Valley, the strength of the UC system, and the opportunities and challenges to develop the new school led him to choose UCSC over more established programs, and so Kang became Baskin&#8217;s second dean in 2001, following Pat Mantey, who had recruited leading faculty and established valuable ties with nearby Silicon Valley.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his new position, Kang was tasked with recruiting faculty and raising the visibility of the school, both of which he excelled at. In his tenure as dean, he doubled the size of the faculty, quadrupled federal research funding from $5 million to $20 million, and grew the school&#8217;s scholarship fund by ten fold. These days, the school is home to more than one fourth of the university&#8217;s undergraduate students and more than a third of its graduate students.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Like me, Steve was a researcher at AT&amp;T Bell Labs during an exciting era of progress and innovation in technology,&#8221; said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;During his time as dean, Steve&#8217;s dedication to recruiting the highest quality faculty and his leadership in expanding the physical footprint of the school have left a lasting legacy, setting up our current and future students, faculty, and staff for success.&#8221;</span></p>
<figure class="image align-right"><img alt="Kang stands at a podium at the 2022 ISCAS Conference" src="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/07/images/newpodium350.png"/>
<figcaption>Kang at the 2022 ISCAS Conference in Texas.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When he arrived, the four-year-old school already had programs in information technology such as electrical engineering and computer science. Kang decided to build out programs in biotechnology and nanotechnology, leading to the formation of the biomolecular engineering department. At about that same time, President Bill Clinton announced the first assembly of the human genome, a revolutionary achievement for which UCSC engineers provided the computational solution. The UCSC Genomics Institute is now a leader in the field, involved in visionary research such as the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/t2t-genome.html?utm_source=04-05-2022&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tuesday-newsday"><span class="s2">Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium</span></a> and the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/pcawg-papers.html"><span class="s2">Pan-Cancer Project</span></a>. And more broadly, Baskin Engineering has staked its claim as a pioneer in games and playable media, data science, and other future-facing areas of research and education, while hosting a fast-growing percentage of the university&#8217;s undergraduate and graduate students.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To recruit faculty, Kang remembers he bought many copies of the book <i>Regional Advantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128</i> and gave them out to candidates, hoping they would read it and understand the opportunities presented by easy accessibility to the emerging tech world. To raise the visibility of the program, he focused on recruiting top graduate students who went on to take positions at prestigious universities. Now, he is happy to see world-class faculty and students come to study in Santa Cruz.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased because these days when we offer interviews and positions to top candidates, in most cases they choose to come to UC Santa Cruz, which is a very good sign,&#8221; Kang said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kang says his biggest challenges in developing the school were based on tight budgets due to small enrollment and the limited availability of physical space. But those problems were no match for the resourceful dean: leveraging funding from the UC system, UC&#8217;s Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS), The California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), and the school&#8217;s namesake Jack Baskin, Kang oversaw the building of the E2 building and Baskin Auditorium, providing 150,000 square feet of new office, laboratory, and classroom space.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He also used limited funds to hire a grant writer to help faculty write successful proposals, which paid off as several programs were established that brought research money and visibility to the school. Kang led the successful establishment of the interdisciplinary NSF-funded Center for Biomimetic Microelectronics, in collaboration with USC and CalTech. The school also became a NASA university-affiliated research center, a ten-year program that facilitated many research grants for work in a variety of areas including air-traffic control, nanotechnology, and IT technology. This legacy of collaboration across divisions and institutions continues today in efforts such as a visionary project on cyber-physical systems which was recently awarded a major <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/sanfelice-cps-award.html"><span class="s2">NSF grant</span></a>, and work to create the first <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/pangenome-project.html"><span class="s2">Human Pangenome</span></a> that represents human genomic diversity.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I thank the administrators, then-chancellor MRC Greenwood and then-provost John Simpson, for trusting me to take over as the second dean of engineering, which opened up opportunities for me to be innovative, work hard, recruit good people, and build up the program,&#8221; Kang said. &#8220;I am very pleased with the way the school of engineering has developed.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Along the way, Kang inspired students with an interdisciplinary approach to engineering education, and advice that went beyond just academia and inspired life-long learning.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;One time when we were discussing professional life, he said, &#8216;Just think like your boss,&#8217;&#8221; said Le Zheng, a mentee of Kang&#8217;s who graduated with a Ph.D. in ECE in 2015. &#8220;I thought that was&#160; tremendous advice and insight that I tried to apply to my work wherever I went. This principle allows me to come out of my little bubble and look at things on a broader and higher level, which really helps to put my work into perspective and motivates me to set the correct priorities that align with a bigger mission.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Going forward, Kang hopes to see the school continue to expand its graduate programs, see alumni gain success in the field, and build on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs &#8211; a goal which he is taking action toward through the "Sung-Mo Steve Kang DEI Award" for faculty.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Leading UC Merced&#160;</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After finishing five years as Dean and entering his second term, Kang was eager to take on a new challenge, and sure enough one presented itself: the newest UC, UC Merced in the San Joaquin Valley, was looking for its second chancellor.&#160;</span><span class="s1">&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I have an attitude to not repeat the same thing,&#8221; Kang said, &#8220;So I was hoping that some change would be good. When the UC Merced opportunity arose I was called by a recruiter to see if I would be interested, and I knew it was a tough competition but I said &#8216;yes, why not, I&#8217;m willing to try!&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After rising above the competition and being offered the position in early January 2007, Kang was so eager to &#8220;jump into hot water&#8221; that he began March 1. One of his first actions was an extensive listening tour around the Central Valley to understand the unique needs of his students, many of whom, like Kang, are the first in their family to attend college and come from low-income households.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Early into its life and amid the Great Recession, UC Merced held the immense potential of a new campus but was stymied by tight budgets and limited physical space. At one point, more than 38 department chairs at UC San Diego signed a petition to shut down UC Merced in the face of budget shortages, an effort which ultimately failed.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Among Kang&#8217;s major accomplishments as chancellor were the attainment of enormously important environmental permits that allowed for the expansion of the campus and significant increases in enrollment.</span></p>

</figure>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In partnership with then UC Vice President (now current UC President) Michael Drake, Kang established the <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/uc-health/functions/prime.html"><span class="s2">UC Programs in Medical Education</span></a> (PRIME) in response to the region&#8217;s need for more doctors. The program, which has since greatly expanded, recruits talented medical students to go on to work in underserved communities and with underserved populations &#8211; in the case of UC Merced, in the Central Valley.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2009, a successful student-led campaign invited then-first lady Michelle Obama to speak at the university&#8217;s commencement ceremony and commemorate the university&#8217;s first graduating class to spend four years at UC Merced, an event which brought major visibility to the campus.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2011, Kang returned to UCSC to focus on teaching and research, but it wasn&#8217;t long before he was recruited to run another university, this time in his home country. Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology (KAIST), known as the MIT of South Korea, was facing a period of turmoil in leadership, and called on Kang to set them back on the right track. In his four years as president, Kang says he was able to reestablish a culture of respect amongst faculty and leadership.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Transformational research&#160;</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a researcher, Kang&#8217;s contributions to electrical engineering are reconized internationally and used by people worldwide in their day-to-day lives. His work is focused on very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits, the kind of microchips found in mobile devices such as phones and laptops that require low power consumption to lengthen battery life. Kang contributed to the earliest research surrounding memristor technology, a building block for electrical circuits that retains memory of energy flow without power.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The technology was first described and named in 1971 in a groundbreaking paper by Leon Chua, a professor of electrical engineering at UC Berkeley, who, the very next year, became Kang&#8217;s Ph.D. advisor. Kang joined Chua&#8217;s foundational, theoretical research exploring the concept and incorporated the technology into the thesis he submitted in 1975.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;[Chua] asked me if I would be interested in working on it, and since it was a new concept, I was interested in working on the research, but at the same time I asked him, as an immigrant student, &#8216;will I be able to find a job if I work on it, since it&#8217;s so new?&#8217;&#8221; Kang said.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the risk paid off when, in 2008, fabrication of the technology was finally made possible by a team at Hewlett Packard. In between his duties as chancellor at UC Merced, Kang organized a symposium for memristors that launched the technology into prominence. Now, memristive technology is extremely prevalent &#8211; Kang says journal editors complain about how many papers they receive on the concept.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kang says in the future we will see the technology mostly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence, where it can be more efficient at realizing these applications in high-packing density &#8211; the art of packing lots of memory in a small space. His ongoing research is mostly focused on how we can mimic the brain using memristor technology.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It turns out, the human brain is the most efficient low-power engine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We consume very, very low power, and yet the human brain can do a lot of things &#8211; computation, memory, logic, and all that.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In retirement, Kang intends to guide his last two Ph.D. students to the completion of their doctoral degrees and continue his research on building a human brain-like function using memristors and CMOS circuits, and pushing the envelope of low-power technology. Also, he looks forward to attending an upcoming reunion of his former Ph.D. students.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kang is a Fellow of <a href="https://www.ieee.org/"><span class="s2">IEEE</span></a>, <a href="https://www.acm.org/"><span class="s2">ACM</span></a> and <a href="https://www.aaas.org/"><span class="s2">AAAS</span></a>, a Foreign Member of the National Academy of Engineering of Korea, and a member of the Korea Academy of Science and Technology (KAST). He was the Founding Editor-in-Chief of the journal IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems and has served as a member of the Board of Governors, Secretary and Treasurer, Administrative Vice President, and the 1991 President of IEEE Circuits and Systems Society with more than 15,000 members.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kang served as President of the Silicon Valley Engineering Council and was inducted into the Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame in 2009. He has also served on the California Council of Science and Technology, UC President&#8217;s Science and Technology Board, the Central Valley Higher Education Consortium Board, the MentorNet Advisory Board, and as Chairman of the Board of the Great Valley Center.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>

Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, will be the faculty director of the center. The center&#8217;s organizational home will be the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences (PBSci).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center will be dedicated to establishing workplaces and learning environments that reflect our equity-forward values and allow the full human diversity of our nation and the world to meaningfully contribute to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Working together through partnerships with the PBSci division and Baskin School of Engineering, the center&#8217;s efforts will re-imagine leadership development and practice on campus to benefit from the multimodal expertise of our full community; it will leverage funding and institutional capital to recognize, motivate, and mentor faculty in removing barriers to education and training in order to ensure equitable access to knowledge and full participation in the modernizing practices of STEM at all career stages.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center will work on: (i) developing leadership pipelines that include both training in the practice of equity-forward values and opportunities for early career leadership; (ii) recommending changes to selection processes to require evidence of ability to lead diverse teams through demonstrated practice of equity-forward values; (iii) building programs that promote and support the recruiting, hiring and development of scientists capable of supporting underrepresented students and trainees. Another essential </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">goal of the center is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o motivate and support individual faculty to create healthy workplaces and learning spaces, by helping them d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">emonstrate knowledge of evidence-based mentoring</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ractices and providing effective resources for mentees as well as reporting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and assessment of mentoring built into funding proposals. The center will (i) ensure that career development of mentees is a focus of funded programs; (ii) encourage STEM members to work in teams on an equity-forward, values-based framework to support junior researchers; (iii) build mentor networks for trainees and provide other channels for information; (iv) provide support and professional development for both mentors and mentees; (v) encourage establishment of support and accountability for effective mentoring at the institution and within grant structures; and (vi) collect survey and demographic data and outcomes to assess programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the center&#8217;s initial programmatic focus will be supporting early career faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars at UCSC with a particular focus on women and individuals from historically marginalized identities in STEM. The program for early career faculty will be geared to provide support for proposal preparation, starting and developing research groups, paper writing and mentoring. A central focus will be the development of support for early career proposals and National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs in close collaboration with the Office of Research. Building on the work of the science division&#8217;s DEI Committee, the center will document (i) efforts by STEM faculty to promote diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)on campus to provide a comprehensive picture of current programs and the experiences of those doing the DEI work and track funding and associated workload; and (ii) the barriers that hinder women and individuals from historically marginalized identities in STEM from advancing to positions of leadership and influence.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center has secured funding to launch its initial work from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, the Sloan Foundation, the Heising-Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation and will leverage the mentoring training infrastructure and expertise of the </span><a href="https://lamat.science.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lamat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Institute at UCSC to advance its goals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a campus, we will soon embark on a strategic planning effort that will support and guide significant faculty growth and diversity, together with advancing research excellence and strengthening an inclusive campus culture. Equity-focused faculty development and furthering research excellence through inclusive excellence are campuswide priorities across all divisions and disciplines. Center for Reimagining Leadership is an important partner in these efforts moving forward.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Lori Kletzer, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3c6f2c3d8072704652014fcfae8ffc7e"><name>vc-strategic-initiatives</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Eric Palkovacs appointed Associate Vice Chancellor for Strategic Initiatives</title><start-date>1658818800000</start-date><path>/2022/07/vc-strategic-initiatives</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/07/vc-strategic-initiatives</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1658871295016</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1658871295016</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Elisa Smith</name><title></title><phone/><email>esmith16@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/eric_palkovacs-.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/eric_palkovacs-.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>eric_palkovacs-.jpg</name><display-name>eric_palkovacs-.jpg</display-name><file-size>3689254</file-size><width>3333</width><height>5000</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Eric Palkovacs, Associate Vice Chancellor for Strategic Initiatives.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}" data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Here's the copy, I will Slack Abby the headshot:\n\nLongtime UCSC professor Eric Palkovacs was recently appointed Associate Vice Chancellor (AVC) for Strategic Initiatives for the Office of Research (OR).

A new study using data collected by elephant seals reveals that in addition to the well documented surface warming, deeper warm-water anomalies associated with the Blob were much more extensive than previously reported.</p>
<p>The new findings were reported by a team of biologists and ocean scientists at UC Santa Cruz in a <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JC018356"><em>paper published July 4 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The elephant seals collect data in different locations than existing oceanographic platforms,&#8221; explained senior author Christopher Edwards, a professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;This is an underutilized dataset that can inform us about important oceanographic processes, as well as helping biologists understand the ecology of northern elephant seals.&#8221;</p>
<p>For decades, UCSC elephant seal researchers led by coauthor Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the UCSC Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS), have been using advanced tagging technology to track the months-long migrations of elephant seals in the North Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>&#8220;While seals have been used to study the physical oceanography of polar regions for some time, this is one of the first studies to use seal-collected data to address physical oceanographic questions in temperate regions, such as the North Pacific Ocean,&#8221; Costa said.</p>
<p>The animal-borne sensors record depth, temperature, and salinity while the animals dive repeatedly to great depths during migrations of some 6,000 miles across the North Pacific.</p>
<p>&#8220;Female elephant seals go out into the open ocean where a ship might go through and collect data only once in awhile, whereas we have elephant seals out there collecting data all over the place,&#8221; said first author and IMS research biologist Rachel Holser. &#8220;It&#8217;s unusual to have this kind of data at the resolution we have in both time and space, and at depths below several hundred meters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The elephant seal data collected during the Blob revealed that abnormally warm temperatures extended 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) below the surface. The subsurface warming persisted into 2017, well after surface temperatures had returned to normal.</p>
<p>The Blob has been well studied with respect to the surface warming, which was driven by atmospheric conditions and was waning by late 2015. The extensive subsurface warming raises questions about the mechanisms behind it, Edwards said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those temperature anomalies are so deep it&#8217;s unlikely it would be due to mixing from the surface,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One reasonable mechanism is that the unusually warm waters were transported northward from further south. What we don&#8217;t know yet is whether that northward transport is directly or indirectly related to the surface warming. Changes at the surface could have altered deeper currents transiently to draw southern waters to the north.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marine heatwaves are expected to increase in frequency, magnitude, and duration as global temperatures continue to rise. These events can have significant impacts on marine life, as well as economic consequences for local communities that rely on marine fisheries and ecosystems. Understanding the physical processes involved in marine heatwaves will help scientists predict their onset and development and allow people to anticipate and address the ecological and economic consequences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like with terrestrial heatwaves, we have seen over the last decade a dramatic increase in the frequency and magnitude of marine heatwaves,&#8221; Holser said. &#8220;The more information we can collect the better off we&#8217;ll be in terms of understanding what&#8217;s happening and facing the challenges. This study shows the value of collaborating with elephant seals to collect oceanographic data that is complementary to other methods.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Holser, Edwards, and Costa, ocean sciences graduate student Theresa Keates also contributed to the study and is a coauthor of the paper. This work was supported by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and the Central &amp; Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS). With CeNCOOS's ongoing support, the Costa lab in collaboration with Edwards and Ocean Sciences Professor Raphael Kudela are continuing to collect oceanographic data using elephant seals.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="46584a048072704674c07249e78f91df"><name>destination-silicon-valley</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz teams with TiE Global to help entrepreneurs bring their ideas to life</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz and TiE Global are establishing the Destination Silicon Valley program to  leverage the Silicon Valley presence of both organizations and create new learning opportunities for university-based entrepreneurs from across the world, including University of California students and innovators, and others from TiE’s 59 chapters.</summary><start-date>1658991600000</start-date><path>/2022/07/destination-silicon-valley</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/07/destination-silicon-valley</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1659037567471</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1659043576288</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Abby Butler</name><title></title><phone/><email>ajbutler@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/7-28-22-tie-global-partnership-cl-001.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/7-28-22-tie-global-partnership-cl-001.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>7-28-22-tie-global-partnership-cl-001.jpg</name><display-name>7-28-22-tie-global-partnership-cl-001.jpg</display-name><file-size>59566</file-size><width>500</width><height>306</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/7-28-22-tie-global-partnership-cl-002.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/7-28-22-tie-global-partnership-cl-002.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>7-28-22-tie-global-partnership-cl-002.jpg</name><display-name>7-28-22-tie-global-partnership-cl-002.jpg</display-name><file-size>6084</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Paul Lopez, co-chair of the TiE University global initiative; UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cindy Larive; TiE Global Chair BJ Arun; and AGK Karunakaran, President of TiE Silicon Valley Board of Directors.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz and TiE Global are establishing the Destination Silicon Valley program to&#160; leverage the Silicon Valley presence of both organizations and create new learning opportunities for university-based entrepreneurs from across the world, including University of California students and innovators, and others from TiE&#8217;s 59 chapters.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both organizations are seeking to further strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem across the global TiE domain and in California. By providing participants with training programs, industry and investor connections, and with the guidance of world-class mentors, participants will be able to grow their ventures to maturity much more quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cindy Larive praised the partnership. &#8220;Leveraging our Silicon Valley campus as the hub for this collaboration will help cement UC Santa Cruz as the UC of the valley,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our campus was founded on the tenets of opportunity and access to higher education for all, and we believe deeply that bringing together people with a wide range of life experiences and perspectives is how the world&#8217;s most challenging problems will be solved.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TiE Global is a nonprofit organization devoted to entrepreneurs in all industries, at all stages, from incubation, through the entrepreneurial life cycle. TiE University helps college startups and founders grow their entrepreneurial ventures into viable and sustainable businesses. They aim to help university startup founders and teams successfully launch and scale their ventures more rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz and TiE aim to take promising teams and provide them with the knowledge, tools, and resources needed on the journey of becoming an &#8216;investment-ready&#8217; startup. For students, staff, and faculty who want to participate, more information will be available this fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B J Arun, Chair of TiE Global said he was excited about this partnership. "TiE has a history of 30 years working with entrepreneurs and creating over $1 trillion of wealth. With our global network of Chapters we can help entrepreneurs connect with the Silicon Valley ecosystem working closely with UC Santa Cruz. TiE Silicon Valley's Charter Members will be great mentors to the teams in this program".</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Silicon Valley Extension and the UC Santa Cruz Innovation &amp; Business Engagement Hub will work with TiE to launch the program in the coming academic year. Teams that successfully complete the Destination Silicon Valley program will also receive a certificate of completion from Extension.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is an exciting moment for our campus innovation and entrepreneurship trajectory. Our partnership with TiE will help ensure that innovators and entrepreneurs from all reaches of the globe have the opportunity to bring their ideas to market,&#8221; Chancellor Larive said.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4b21940380727046453f1c6dc6c11e7f"><name>alumni-regent-art-torres</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>As alumni regent, Art Torres advocated for access, diversity in higher education</title><summary>Art Torres (Stevenson, ’68, government) worked to support the University of California in advancing the diversity of its student body while serving a two-year term as the alumni representative on the UC Board of Regents.&#13;

<p>The University of California is governed by the 26-member Board of Regents, which has authority over university policies, financial affairs, tuition and fees. The alumni regent rotates among the ten campuses. As an alumni regent, Torres focused on supporting campuses in providing access and increasing representation of Black undergraduate students and diversifying the students planning to become doctors. He also supported university efforts to eliminate barriers that make it difficult for students to pursue a higher education.</p>
<p>The work takes time to show results, though Torres points to the increasing number of Black undergraduates as a sign that systemwide efforts are succeeding. The number of black undergraduates at UC reached 9,886 in fall 2021, after several years of steady gains. However, Torres is quick to note that there is so much more work to be done.</p>
<p>With a long history in California leadership and politics&#8212;Torres served in the California State Assembly (1974&#8211;1982), the state Senate (1982&#8211;1994), and as chair of the California Democratic Party (1996&#8211;2009)&#8212;and as one of the students in the second graduating class at UC Santa Cruz, he brought a distinctive perspective to discussions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud to have served as the alumni regent for Santa Cruz because I love the campus and I love what they&#8217;re doing and have been able to do with respect to the future,&#8221; Torres said. &#8220;Santa Cruz is very special.&#8221;</p>
<p>Torres was a strong advocate for UC Santa Cruz, encouraging the board to approve Student Housing West, which will provide housing for about 3,000 undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<p>Torres reflected on his experience serving on the UC Board of Regents, his priorities, and how alumni can support the University of California during a recent interview. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p>
<h3>You&#8217;ve served in the California Assembly, the state Senate, and in many other leadership roles. What was it like to serve as an alumni representative to the UC Board of Regents? How was serving as a Regent similar or different?</h3>
<p>No. 1, I never thought I&#8217;d be doing that, and No. 2, the term is too short. It&#8217;s only two years, and I think you really are hamstrung in terms of what you can achieve. Although I wouldn&#8217;t want to serve for 12 or 15 years as some of my former colleagues did either.</p>
<p>What I found the most interesting is the challenge of dealing with so many issues. Dolores Huerta, who founded the farmworker&#8217;s union, was my first boss, and at 92, is still going pretty strong. She told me ahead of time, &#8220;Be careful because if you&#8217;re going to do this you&#8217;re going to have so much reading to do. It&#8217;s going to be impossible for your time.&#8221; And she was right. It takes a lot of time to be up to speed on issues that come before the board.</p>
<p>And so what I&#8217;ve told the future alumni regents as they come on board is figure out what areas of expertise you want to develop and keep it short and keep it brief to that point. So that&#8217;s what I did. The first was dealing with the Student Housing West project at UC Santa Cruz to make sure the environment was protected. Working with community leaders, and also with the chancellor and other activists, I wanted to make sure we had a plan that was carefully considered.</p>
<p>The other issue is the abysmal record we have on admitting African Americans to the UC. One of the important ways to increase the representation among Black students is by ensuring that our campuses are welcoming and inclusive spaces. One way to do this is by having a diverse faculty that reflects our student body.</p>
<p>Only 6% of our admissions class are African-Americans. Now there are reasons for that&#8212;and one of the reasons is there&#8217;s a known identity issue with black professors. There aren&#8217;t enough in the UC system.</p>
<p>So Black students don&#8217;t feel comfortable in an environment where they don&#8217;t see one of their own in leadership roles or in the classroom, other than our great UC President Michael Drake. But other than that we don&#8217;t have enough out there, and that includes Latinos and Asian and Pacific Islander (API) professors as well.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve done well (with providing access for Latinos) as we&#8217;ve done at Santa Cruz. We&#8217;re now a Hispanic-Serving university. But we haven&#8217;t done enough in terms of the professional areas where we need more Latino professors, more API professors and, clearly, more African American professors. I put my stake on that issue and now Janet Reilly, who I&#8217;m very close to as a Regent, she&#8217;s taking on that issue now as I leave and so that&#8217;s been important.</p>
<p>The other is something that I worked on with John Perez, who was a former speaker of the Assembly and was appointed by (then Gov.) Jerry Brown to a lengthy term, and that is looking at the medical schools and diversity admissions. They&#8217;re horrible&#8212;you don&#8217;t find Latinos being admitted to the medical schools or African-Americans&#8212;not enough diversity or color within the admissions classes of UC medical schools.</p>
<h3>How did you approach providing an alumni perspective to the discussions or did you see this role providing more than an alumni perspective?</h3>
<p>It became greater than that perspective. There was a priority for me and that is &#8220;How do we reach out to other nations where we have UC alumni?&#8221; We have 1.2 million UC alumni worldwide and I felt the necessary thing was what happens to a student who graduates from UC and is looking for work in London? Who do they talk to? So we&#8217;ve established alumni associations, some that are more active than others. I started connecting with those to see how we could increase our numbers, and that&#8217;s work that&#8217;s going to require a long time.</p>
<p>Another piece of unfinished business is how do we increase alumni associations in Mexico, South America, Europe, and Asia to give access to our students to areas that they may not have had before?</p>
<h3>What are you most proud of?</h3>
<p>Making a breakthrough on the African American admissions numbers&#8212;and it&#8217;s not enough yet. Also, working with Regent John Perez on how we increase admissions for Africans, Latinos in our medical schools because we don&#8217;t have enough (enrolled). Having served as the Assembly Health Committee chairman 27 years ago, it was a problem then and it hasn&#8217;t changed.</p>
<p>The work is ongoing and must be supported by also increasing the number of Black professors in UC, strengthening our efforts to make the campuses diverse, inclusive and welcoming, and by providing more support for all our students, through stipends and scholarships, and by providing more campus housing.</p>
<h3>What do you see as the big issues facing higher education in California?</h3>
<p>Housing, No 1. Where are we going to put our students? The availability of housing in Santa Cruz is miniscule and that&#8217;s not uncommon at Berkeley. Davis is different because they provide housing for community college students. They have an ongoing relationship with Sacramento City College so the students actually live on the UC campus. A lot of them are thereby encouraged when they graduate to apply to UC Davis because they enjoyed the experience so much.</p>
<p>Have your views of the UC and UCSC changed? If so, how and why? No, they&#8217;ve been expanded for the most part. I helped write two master plans for higher education when I was in the Assembly and then in the Senate. I chaired a committee on admissions when I was in the Senate. My relationship with the system and with the campuses has been long-term and the impact that I want to see happen has started to be implemented.</p>
<h3>How can alumni best support and advocate for UC?</h3>
<p>By associating with their own alumni association with their campus of origin. We see a lot of that where alumni come back to give and to participate. It&#8217;s not just about raising money for the campus. It&#8217;s also about having the input into the campus and sharing their perspective. The other way alumni provide support is by meeting with students. That can be very important by relaying stories, information, or their own history in terms of how the campus has grown. We see that with a number of campuses&#8212;for example UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, and Berkeley&#8212;and you see the increase in the alumni to be available to students. The relationships and the exchanges are very rewarding.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4b828e2280727046453f1c6dd9e88677"><name>felicity-schaeffer-unsettled-borders</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New book traces the scientific and technological development of militarized border</title><summary>In her new book, Professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race and Ethnic Studies Felicity Amaya Schaeffer draws stunning connections between indigenous ways of life and relationships to the land with modern-day, militaristic border surveillance technologies. </summary><start-date>1659078000000</start-date><display-name>Felicity Amaya Schaeffer Unsettled Borders</display-name><path>/2022/07/felicity-schaeffer-unsettled-borders</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/07/felicity-schaeffer-unsettled-borders</link><created-by>sjorda</created-by><created-on>1659124223497</created-on><last-modified-by>sjorda</last-modified-by><last-modified>1660088015513</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Feminist Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Publications</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Liza Monroy</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/felicity-amaya-schaeffer-350px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/felicity-amaya-schaeffer-350px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>felicity-amaya-schaeffer-350px.jpg</name><display-name>felicity-amaya-schaeffer-350px.jpg</display-name><file-size>205972</file-size><width>350</width><height>522</height></image><image-alt>Felicity Amaya Schaeffer</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/felicity-amaya-schaeffer-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/felicity-amaya-schaeffer-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>felicity-amaya-schaeffer-80px.jpg</name><display-name>felicity-amaya-schaeffer-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>20933</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Felicity Amaya Schaeffer</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felicity Amaya Schaeffer, Professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race and Ethnic Studies (Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her new book, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race and Ethnic Studies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Felicity Amaya Schaeffer draws stunning connections between indigenous ways of life and relationships to the land with modern-day, militaristic border surveillance technologies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsettled Borders: The Militarized Science of Surveillance on Sacred Indigenous Land </span></i><a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/unsettled-borders"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Duke University Press, August 2022)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> looks at the U.S.-Mexico border and beyond through the perspective of Native tribes living across the border and those who are forced off their land from the Maya region of Mexico and Guatemala. The book expands on Schaeffer&#8217;s research interests from her previous book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love and Empire</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which she chronicled the rise of cybermarriage as a pathway to migration and citizenship. &#8220;I&#8217;m always thinking about the border as/and technology,&#8221; she says. &#8220;My grandparents migrated across the US-Mexico border before it was even a border, during the Mexican Revolution. There is nothing natural about borders, yet borders have been an obsession of mine because they&#8217;ve defined so much of my family&#8217;s life and how they see themselves as Mexican-Americans in this country. At this moment when the border is becoming more dangerous and militarized, I started to think, how has it become so militarized? How would you begin to research that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Readers may be surprised to find that technologies such as swarm drones and an automated border patrol agent called AVATAR are not concepts from a futuristic </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Mirror </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">episode but part of current borderland realities. In chapters spanning </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apache, Tohono O&#8217;odham, and Maya cultures,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Schaeffer uncovers ways Indigenous concepts are being co-opted in AI and robotics, delving</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the ways </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">militarized technology has stemmed from, for example, Apache surveillance methods and how swarm surveillance &#8220;(mis)appropriates Maya beekeeping science.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her research, &#8220;it became clear there was this deep connection,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The containment of the reservation, the containment of the border, was a heartbreaking story to think about, how Indian fugitives were a threat to the settlement of the Western frontier and newly purchased southwest border territory with Mexico&#8212;these Apache and Sioux Indian scouts were hired by the Cavalry to be the eyes of the army before they had drones.&#8221; Drones which, she points out, now carry names such as &#8220;Apache&#8221; and &#8220;Blackhawk.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schaeffer traveled to Tech Park at the University of Arizona and &#8220;followed the technologies they were using to militarize the border,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The academy was implicated in the study and design of border technologies.&#8221; While conducting research there at a stage when she did not yet know what the book would be, she was more focused on how technologies affect migrants. &#8220;I had no idea there was this other story,&#8221; she says. &#8220;When I got to Tech Park, I thought I&#8217;d find the drones and surveillance towers, but a woman I was interviewing there sent me to Fort Huachuca and that&#8217;s where the story really began for me.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As her discoveries were resonating deeply, Schaeffer also faced uncertainty. While Indigenous practices such as knowledge of herbs and other healing techniques continued to be practiced by her Mexican grandmother who denied any claims to being Indigenous, she felt unsure as to whether a story about Native peoples living along the borderlands was hers to tell. &#8220;The project emerged at a time when I started to connect with my calling back to the land as a de-Nativized Xicana. It was a project that continued to pull me in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time that was percolating, she met a few tribal members from the O'odham reservation through one of her students. They&#8217;d come to Santa Cruz from Arizona and over dinner, began talking about the influence of the border on their reservation. &#8220;Our perspectives were aligned,&#8221; she says. &#8220;They invited me to the reservation so I could see the border myself, to understand more about their land, and to speak with elders and others fighting against the border wall. It was a powerful trip.&#8221; The O&#8217;odham reservation spans what is often called the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, and Schaeffer chronicles the disruptions to their lands including destruction of ancestral burial grounds and sacred saguaro cactus to build the border wall and surveillance infrastructure.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schaeffer expresses the hope for a borderless world and a return of the land to the many Native tribes living on and across this land. In the conclusion she calls for an end to the technological violence driving border infrastructure and the bordered thinking that enacts genocidal violence against Indigenous peoples across time and space: &#8220;Wire, metal, and virtual fences will fall, rust, and be dewired. As the empire spreads, so, too, do the Native peoples and allies in a broad-based protest that includes the earth&#8217;s forceful ancestors. The waters will flow, the animals will cross, and the flowers will bloom again so the land and people will heal and regenerate the gift of life for all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schaeffer, who is currently the Peggy and Jack Baskin Presidential Chair in Feminist Studies, is grateful her research was supported by a UCSC COR grant, a grant from the Research Center of the Americas, and from the Fellows Academy in 2019&#8211;20, a writing program initiated by former executive vice chancellor Marlene Tromp. Proceeds from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsettled Borders</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support the Tohono O'odham participants of the </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/supportpdj/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peace and Dignity Journey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new project she&#8217;s undertaking is a public symposium on the emerging field of Indigenous Borderlands through the Baskin Endowed Chair in Winter Quarter. &#8220;The Indigenous Borderlands Symposium explodes nation-state thinking through land-based practice across intimate and planetary scales, reconfiguring belonging, law, and the boundaries of land and human becoming. She hopes the conversations from the symposium will culminate in a collaborative special issue of a journal she is working on with her co-collaborators from across the UC-system.&#160;</span></p>
