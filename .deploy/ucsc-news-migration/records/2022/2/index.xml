<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An African American studies professor at Princeton University, Benjamin has investigated the ways in which discrimination is hardwired into modern technology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjamin will bring her incisive scholarship and her engaging speaking style to the all-virtual 38th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation, which will take place on Wednesday, February 23, at 5:30 p.m. The event is free and open to the public; those who wish to attend the convocation may <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/events/mlk/2022/">register in advance</a>.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="#https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_GLK53f7HRLKEScMR667XyA"></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This annual celebration of King&#8217;s life and legacy has become a proud tradition for UC Santa Cruz, with a stunning lineup of speakers over the years, including activist and UC Santa Cruz professor emerita Angela Davis, poet Nikki Giovanni, Harvard professor and author Cornel West, and Black Lives Matter cofounder Alicia Garza.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the COVID-19 pandemic forced a temporary switch to a virtual format, the conference was held at the Civic Auditorium in downtown Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gathering annually to reflect on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. is important to the campus for the purpose of building community and reinforcing our principles of community, but more so is to move us to action,&#8221; said committee chair Judith Estrada, UCSC&#8217;s executive director and interim chief diversity officer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;More importantly, this year we are focusing on restorative healing due to so much loss our communities have endured,&#8221; Estrada said. &#8220;We are excited that Dr. Benjamin will be joining us to invigorate our minds and hearts through a heartfelt keynote speech.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjamin is the founding director of Princeton University&#8217;s&#160; Ida B.Wells JUST Data Lab, where undergraduate researchers work on a wide range of projects that expose injustices hidden in statistics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a 2019 interview with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guardian,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Benjamin spoke in depth about the ways prejudice can be encoded or &#8220;embedded&#8221; in technology, though she also has strong ideas about how tech could be reformed in the name of fairness and equity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many of these automated systems are trying to identify and predict risk. So we have to look at how risk was assessed historically&#8212;whether a bank would extend a loan to someone, or if a judge would give someone a certain sentence,&#8221; Benjamin told the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guardian</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "The decisions of the past are the input for how we teach software to make those decisions in the future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same interview, she also talked about discriminatory hiring algorithims, and the &#8220;racialized&#8221; ways that machines can assess risk. She describes technologies that sustain or worsen racism as &#8220;Jim Code,&#8221; echoing the term "Jim Crow," the former practice of segregating Black people in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160; examines the relationship between machine bias and systemic racism, analyzing specific cases of &#8220;discriminatory design&#8221; and offering tools for a socially conscious approach to tech development.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a review of the book&#8212;which was awarded Brooklyn Public Library&#8217;s 2020 Nonfiction Prize&#8212;Stephen Kearse of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nation </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">praised Benjamin for her &#8220;withering critique&#8221; of tech that sustains or worsens racism.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Her inventive and wide-ranging analyses remind us that as much as we try to purge ourselves from our tools and view them as external to our flaws, they are always extensions of us," wrote Kearse. "As exacting a worldview as that is, it is also inclusive and hopeful."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjamin is the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">People&#8217;s Science: Bodies and Rights on the Stem Cell Frontier</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She has studied the social dimensions of science, technology, and medicine and speaks widely on issues of innovation, equity, health, and justice in the U.S. and globally.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She serves on the Executive Committees for the Program in Global Health and Health Policy and Center for Digital Humanities, and is also a faculty associate in the Center for Information Technology Policy; Program on History of Science; Center for Health and Wellbeing; Program on Gender and Sexuality Studies; and Department of Sociology. Ruha is the recipient of many awards and honors, including the 2017 President's Award for Distinguished Teaching at Princeton.</span><a href="https://#https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/events/mlk/2022/"></a></p>

Among the thousands of acres it charred were multiple coastal watersheds from San Mateo County to Big Sur.</p>
<p>For UC Santa Cruz fish ecologist Eric Palkovacs, the burns offered a chance to study how the runoff after wildfire affects one of the region&#8217;s most iconic fish: steelhead trout. Unlike rainbow trout, which technically belong to the same species <em>(Onchorhyncus mykiss),</em> endangered steelhead hatch in in freshwater streams, migrate to the ocean to mature, and finally return to their natal stream to spawn.</p>
<p>Palkovacs worries that chemicals in runoff from burned landscapes are causing the trout&#8217;s sense of smell to go haywire. That could mean disaster for an entire generation of the federally threatened fish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Salmonids rely on their sense of smell to create an imprint on their home watershed when they&#8217;re juveniles. If that imprinting process is interfered with, they may not be able to make the return migration back to their home watershed as an adult,&#8221; said Palkovacs, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>His concerns are based on the findings of previous research by UC Santa Cruz environmental toxicologist Peter Weiss-Penzias, who has found elevated levels of mercury in even pristine coastal areas. Together with NOAA fisheries biologist Dave Rundio, Weiss-Penzias reported that steelhead from the Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve in Big Sur contain more mercury than trout from most other West Coast locations. One fish caught in the reserve contained as much as one part per million of mercury in its tissues, making it decidedly unsafe for human consumption. Yet the reserve watershed drains wilderness untouched by mines, factories, or other mercury-emitting activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the cleanest places in the northern hemisphere,&#8221; Weiss-Penzias says. The mercury itself, the product of industrial pollution and natural emissions, was likely deposited from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Palkovacs is particularly concerned about the juvenile trout rearing in coastal streams during blazes. &#8220;Wildfires may create this release of mercury that may be particularly harmful because it&#8217;s emitted in one big pulse,&#8221; Palkovacs says. &#8220;Steelhead use smell to sense predators, detect other fish, and find prey. Is that going to interfere with their life in the stream?&#8221;</p>
<p>To find out, Palkovacs has joined forces with both Weiss-Penzias and fish biologist Maryam Kamran of Virginia Tech. The three are principal investigators on a National Science Foundation RAPID grant to understand the impact of wildfires on salmonid olfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We joke that we&#8217;re on a fishing expedition, because we&#8217;re not exactly sure what we&#8217;re going to see. But that&#8217;s the point of these RAPID grants, is to assess the effects of catastrophic events, like wildfires,&#8221; Weiss-Penzias says.</p>
<h2>Natural experiment</h2>
<p>The aftermath of the 2020 burns laid the groundwork for a natural experiment. The researchers found four coastal watersheds where the mosaic pattern of the fire burned one drainage, but left an adjacent one unscathed: Pescadero Creek along the San Mateo coast; the San Lorenzo River in Santa Cruz; the Carmel River near Monterey; and the Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve (part of the UC Natural Reserve System), which they paired with unburned Willow Creek just to the south.</p>
<p>At each of the four pairs of sites, NOAA Fisheries Santa Cruz laboratory scientists caught up to a dozen live steelhead. The researchers then tested each fish&#8217;s ability to smell via what they call a Y-maze trial. The watery maze itself is as basic as can be: a holding area that branches into two arms. The test involves dripping the scent of a predator in one arm, and plain creek water in the other, then tracking which arm the fish prefers.</p>
<p>They compared fish from burned and unburned watersheds to see if the release of toxins from wildfires had impacted their ability to smell the predator cue. In fish from the unburned watersheds, the olfactory systems should have developed normally and they should exhibit strong avoidance of the predator cue, Palkovacs said.</p>
<p>While the maze itself was simple, the effort required to run the trials outdoors was immense. Testing the fish in the field both enables the animals to be tested in familiar waters and reduces the stresses and potential deaths of being transported to a lab.</p>
<p>Lab technician Morgan Abbott fabricated the team&#8217;s mobile fish behavior lab, the first ever to test fish outdoors in their home environments. The elaborate contraption features lights to illuminate the fish, web cameras to track their movements, pumps and hoses to supply water from the creek, and covers for the mazes to ensure the fish are influenced by smell and not sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took a lot to set up the whole thing. We had to make sure the mazes were clean, make sure that the footage device was connected to cables, laid out a long water hose to get enough creek water to supply the experiment,&#8221; says Litzia Galvan, a fourth-year marine biology major working in Palkovacs&#8217;s lab. The project represents the first and only opportunity she&#8217;s had to do field work in college.</p>
<p>Interpreting the behavior of the fish is surprisingly complex. &#8220;We use auto-tracking software to determine how much time the fish spent moving versus nonmoving. How much time was it spending on one arm of the Y versus the other side? Was it moving in quick, jerky movements or was it smoothly swimming around? These are indicators of whether the fish was feeling comfortable or exhibiting a response that would indicate stress,&#8221; Palkovacs says.</p>
<p>After the maze test, each fish was euthanized. The scientists then dissected out the organs responsible for smell, known as the olfactory rosettes, as well as samples of muscle tissue and creek water.</p>
<p>To determine how well these olfactory cells are functioning, Palkovacs plans to analyze which of their genes are active. &#8220;If the gene expression profile of normal salmonid olfactory cells is different in burned and unburned watersheds, that would give us a clue as to whether they are imprinting as they normally would, or whether there was some interference with that process,&#8221; he says.</p>
<h2>Heavy metals</h2>
<p>On the chemistry side, Weiss-Penzias is in charge of analyzing whether heavy metals such as mercury, copper, lead, and manganese are present in the water and tissue samples, and at what levels.</p>
<p>Galvan has been helping to prepare the fish muscle tissue for analysis. &#8220;[We] add chemicals to the muscle tissues so they can dissolve. Once they do, we&#8217;re going to put them into a spectrophotometer and that will let us know the chemical composition of each sample. Then we want to compare how many chemicals are inside, and what&#8217;s the most dominant chemical,&#8221; Galvan says.</p>
<p>At present, Weiss-Penzias is in the midst of analyzing samples from the rest of the study sites.</p>
<p>So far, samples taken from San Lorenzo River after the major storm of October 25 show far more mercury than samples taken earlier that autumn, when water in the river originated from groundwater. &#8220;This makes sense because it&#8217;s washing everything off and putting it in the river,&#8221; Weiss-Penzias says. Fire would easily have volatilized whatever was present in vegetation or soil, as mercury evaporates at temperatures as low as 85 degrees Fahrenheit, potentially moving it into streams and, ultimately, into the fish.</p>
<p>These findings are supported by the results of another analysis of mercury at the NRS&#8217;s Blue Oak Ranch Reserve east of San Jose on Mount Hamilton. As at Landels-Hill Big Creek, large swaths of Blue Oak also burned during the autumn 2020 wildfires.</p>
<p>For a National Science Foundation GEOPATHS internship with Weiss-Penzias, UCSC undergraduate Ariel Santero took soil samples from both burned and unburned areas of the reserve. &#8220;The general trend was that the burn samples have less mercury because all that mercury had volatilized into the atmosphere, where it may have got into local waterways, maybe traveled even further than that. And the unburned samples still had their mercury because it was not volatilized,&#8221; says Santero, who presented her results at the December 2021 meeting of the American Geophysical Union.</p>
<p>Of most biological concern is the amount of mercury that is actually dissolved in the water and moves into stream food webs. In its ionic form, solubilized mercury is more reactive. It can more easily pass through cell walls and interfere with the biochemical processes of fish and other organisms. To distinguish between soluble and particle-bound mercury, Weiss-Penzias will test both filtered and unfiltered samples.</p>
<p>Weiss-Penzias is equally intrigued by other toxins he might find in the samples. &#8220;What will be new for me is quantifying the other metals besides mercury. It will provide an assessment of variability across watersheds and conditions where there haven&#8217;t been many measurements done in the past,&#8221; Weiss-Penzias says.</p>
<p>The research team hopes their work will yield more definitive results later in the year. Either way, the project will shed light on how wildfire, an increasingly common component of California life, affects the water and the organisms that call this state home.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bcb0a84f8072704671ace417a8000b85"><name>wind-advisory</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>High-wind advisory in effect through 9 p.m. tonight</title><summary>The National Weather Service has issued a High-Wind Warning for Santa Cruz County and much of the San Francisco Bay Area through 9 p.m. this evening.</summary><start-date>1643788800000</start-date><display-name>High-wind advisory in effect through 9 p.m. tonight</display-name><path>/2022/02/wind-advisory</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/02/wind-advisory</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1643843201027</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1643843201027</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>The National Weather Service has issued a High-Wind Warning for Santa Cruz County and much of the San Francisco Bay Area through 9 p.m. this evening.

<h2>The Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated Campus Testing Protocol</li>
<li>Expanded On-Campus Testing Options</li>
<li>Reminder: Complete Your Daily Symptom Checker</li>
<li>Reminder: Upgraded Face Coverings Available</li>
<li>Reminder: Uploading Your Proof of Vaccination</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updated Campus Testing Protocol</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve updated our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643926545488000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1oXYGbwDydsDR5Sifi6WC5" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UC Santa Cruz Testing Protocol</a> for the campus community in conjunction with our return to primarily in-person instruction. Testing continues to be an important part of our response, and we&#8217;ve worked to increase testing capacity and accessibility with the goal of expanded flexibility to ensure the wellbeing of our most at-risk campus populations.</p>
<p><strong>As a reminder, getting a COVID-19 booster is required</strong> pursuant to <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/5000695/SARS-CoV-2_Covid-19&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643926545488000&amp;usg=AOvVaw05g1WPSaERu8jPQbXPkbA4" href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/5000695/SARS-CoV-2_Covid-19" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UC policy</a>. The deadline to submit proof of your booster was Jan. 31. For those that were not eligible as of Jan. 31, the deadline to submit proof of your booster is two weeks after you are eligible to receive your booster.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will use the following definitions, consistent with recommended guidance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Up-to-Date</strong>: A person is considered up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations when they have received all recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including all booster dose(s) when eligible.</li>
<li><strong>Booster Eligible:</strong> A person is considered booster eligible when they are fully vaccinated and at least five months have passed since the last dose of an mRNA ( <em>i.e.</em> Moderna or Pfizer) vaccine or two months have passed since the Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen vaccine.</li>
</ul>
<p>For employees, please note the following updated testing requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you <em>are not</em> Up-to-Date on your COVID-19 vaccinations <i>and</i> have an approved exception, and come to campus at least once a week, </strong>you must test every 4 days at one of our campus test sites.</li>
<li><strong>If you <em>are</em> Up-to-Date on your COVID-19 vaccinations (have received your booster or are not yet booster eligible) <em>and</em>come to campus at least once a week, </strong>testing is not required but you can test as often as desired.</li>
<li><strong>If you come to campus only occasionally (once a month, once a quarter, etc.), and are not</strong> <strong>Up-to-Date on your COVID-19 vaccinations and have an approved or pending exception request</strong>, you need to take a test 24 hours prior to your arrival with a self-administered COVID-19 test ( <em>i.e.</em> , a rapid antigen test). If your test result is positive, please postpone your return until your healthcare provider has cleared you. If you test negative, you may arrive on campus but still need to test at one of our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-faq.html%23on_campus_covid_tests&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643926545488000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0qhY7iGHzAlJh0h-fIOFEt" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-faq.html#on_campus_covid_tests" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campus testing locations</a>&#160;(or with a rapid antigen test while on campus) within 24 hours of your arrival.</li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the early phases of the pandemic in 2020, Latino people across California were dying of COVID-19 at a rate far greater than their share of the state&#8217;s population, and Black communities were similarly affected, though to a smaller degree. These disparities reflect a wide variety of socioeconomic and racial inequities, ranging from who was more likely to work in occupations with high exposure risk and low workplace protections to who had the least access to testing and medical care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as vaccines became available starting in January of 2021, deaths across the state quickly began to decline, and the research team wanted to know how this might affect disparities among the four largest racial and ethnic groups in the state. Their analysis showed that, while some of the equity gaps in proportional death rates closed during this time period, others widened.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The dominant narrative in the media at the time was about how much success vaccination was having with creating large declines in overall mortality, but this research shows that it&#8217;s also important to pay close attention to proportional changes within racial and ethnic groups,&#8221; said Alicia Riley, a joint-first author of the study and an assistant professor of sociology at UCSC.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By analyzing data specific to race and ethnicity, the team found that, from March 2021 to July, the proportion of California&#8217;s COVID-19 deaths for middle-aged people occurring among Latinos dropped from 66% to 30%, while the relative proportion of deaths increased among middle-aged Black people, from 6% to 21%, and among middle-aged white people, from 17% to 36%. Trends did not change substantially for Asian communities in California during this time period.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<h2>Equity gap closes between Latino and white Californians for first time in pandemic</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, from January to July of 2021, California&#8217;s Latino population experienced a 48-fold age-standardized reduction in COVID-19 deaths. By July, this had helped to bring the group&#8217;s proportionate death rate down to below their share of the state&#8217;s population for the first time in the pandemic, closing the biggest longstanding equity gap.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper&#8217;s authors believe multiple factors may have driven these trends for Latino populations, including a combination of vaccine-induced and natural immunity. Some estimates suggest the proportion of Latino people in California who were fully vaccinated by early May was about 24%.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The 2020 winter COVID-19 surge hit Latino communities especially hard, resulting in a lot of deaths but also likely some natural immunity, which vaccination then built upon,&#8221; Riley explained. &#8220;There were also widespread efforts, from the state to the local level, taking place over this time period to try to reduce these disparities by reaching people with testing and vaccination, and that&#8217;s likely playing a role in some of this too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, during the vaccination period, death rates for white people in California climbed slightly above their share of the population for the first time in the pandemic, despite an estimated 41% being vaccinated by early May. The paper&#8217;s authors suspect this trend may reflect a combination of vaccine hesitancy in some more rural and conservative predominantly-white communities and overall lower immunity, since white people were disproportionately spared from earlier infection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Part of what is closing this equity gap and making disparities look like they're improving is that whites are now dying at a higher proportion,&#8221; Riley said. &#8220;They're kind of losing the advantage that they enjoyed for the first part of the pandemic, and that has really shifted during the vaccination period.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By comparison, Asian people in California&#8212;who also experienced advantages in reduced mortality early in the pandemic&#8212;had an estimated vaccination rate of about 50% by May and have maintained fewer deaths than their share of the state&#8217;s population since that time.</span></p>
<h2>Growing equity gap for Black Californians raises alarm</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper&#8217;s most important finding may prove to be the widening of mortality disadvantages for Black Californians during the early vaccination period. It&#8217;s a distinctly different outcome from Latino communities, despite the fact that estimated vaccination rates for Black people in California by May were greater, at 26%. Differences in prior exposure and resulting natural immunity may be contributing to these trends, but overall, the research team considers these findings a red flag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This really is concerning, because it highlights how the structural forces driving some of these disparities may be different for different racial and ethnic groups, and some of those factors may be more intractable than others,&#8221; Riley said. &#8220;For example, differential workplace exposure may be easier to eliminate through policy than structural discrimination in the health care system.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional research will be needed to investigate the potential causes of these disparities and to parse out how specific policy actions may have affected equity gaps.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a lot to be learned about vaccine rollout in different racial and ethnic groups in different areas,&#8221; said Mathew Kiang, an assistant professor of epidemiology and population health at Stanford University and a joint-first author of the paper alongside Riley. &#8220;Vaccination campaigns are often implemented as one-size-fits-all, but we clearly see racially patterned uptake and room for improvement.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current study may help to focus future research and public health strategies on the changing nature of vulnerability to COVID-19. That landscape of disparities may continue to shift, especially with variants like delta or omicron.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This study shows us that racial disparities in who is dying of COVID-19 can transform quickly,&#8221; Riley said. &#8220;That means mortality disparities are not inevitable; different choices can worsen or improve them. But any gains can also be lost quickly if there aren&#8217;t adequate structural factors and policies put in place to protect people.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c24088c78072704671ace41742405364"><name>mednick-fred-teachers-without-borders</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Bridging the educational divide on a global scale </title><summary>Alumnus Fred Mednick, founder of two-time Peace Prize–winning NGO Teachers Without Borders, has worked to expand worldwide educational access for over two decades.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At about </span><a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/teachers#1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">85 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, teachers are one of the largest groups of trained professionals in the world. Yet students&#8217; access to education is exceedingly disproportionate on an international level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz alumnus and trailblazer for social change Fred Mednick (Stevenson &#8217;76, literature) founded the world-renowned organization Teachers Without Borders in 2000 to combat the global educational divide by utilizing teachers as catalysts for change in 171 countries around the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Teachers have always been&#8212;and it is their very nature to be&#8212;true catalysts of change, the acupuncture points of our society, and the glue that holds our world together,&#8221; Mednick says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An educator himself, Mednick is currently a professor of education sciences at Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium while working remotely from his home in Seattle.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After earning his undergraduate education at UC Santa Cruz, Mednick received his M.A. in education from Claremont University in 1982 and then his doctorate in comparative education at Seattle University in 1999.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mednick looks back at his time at UC Santa Cruz as a pivotal moment in affirming the connection between higher education and social change throughout his educational endeavors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC trusted me to reflect not only upon what I was learning, but how I could translate learning into social change,&#8221; he says. &#8220;UCSC helped me understand that I could shape a path. I must say how important that is, because prior to attending the university, I wasn&#8217;t certain I could.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Shaping paths for students worldwide</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers Without Borders offers many developmental programs and courses for both teachers and students, including </span><a href="https://teacherswithoutborders.org/peace"><span style="font-weight: 400;">peace education programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://teacherswithoutborders.org/education-in-emergencies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">education in emergencies programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://teacherswithoutborders.org/girls-education"><span style="font-weight: 400;">girls&#8217; education courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raised in a feminist household and a father of two daughters, Mednick recognized the inequities in educational opportunities for women and girls worldwide and the importance of bridging that divide.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s more than just reaching a minimum standard,&#8221; Mednick says. &#8220;The world needs feminist leaders who are scholars as well as practitioners.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.unicef.org/education/girls-education"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimates that 129 million girls are out of school, and only 49 percent of countries have achieved gender parity in primary education worldwide.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can go on and on about the importance of girls&#8217; education for the world,&#8221; Mednick says. &#8220;Educated girls are 50% more likely to immunize their children in the future and with an extra year of education, a girl can earn up to 20% more as an adult. A child born to a literate mother is 50% more likely to survive past the age of 5.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers Without Borders works directly with international NGOs and civil society organizations that focus on re-enrollment programs, anti-early-marriage campaigns, and the prevention of human trafficking. In addition, Teachers Without Borders provides free courses for teachers, with an emphasis on the before, during, and after of education in emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mednick says his organization has substantially impacted girls&#8217; education in Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, South Africa, Rwanda, Burundi, China, India, Haiti, Suriname, and Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers Without Borders&#8217;s efforts in girls&#8217; education in Afghanistan were significantly impacted by the Taliban&#8217;s takeover of most of the country&#8217;s borders in August 2021, threatening women and girls&#8217; rights and educational opportunities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The whole thing breaks my heart,&#8221; Mednick says. &#8220;Women&#8217;s organizations and NGOs serving girls&#8217; and women&#8217;s education are under assault. But even then, there are extraordinary efforts afoot.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mednick says Teachers Without Borders continues to support efforts in Afghanistan through two initiatives focused on girls&#8217; education but would not get into specifics given the sensitivity of the situation in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to know exactly what is going on there, and though we receive anecdotal information, we have to tread carefully,&#8221; Mednick says. &#8220;Afghanistan may be out of the headlines now, but I refuse to forget. No one should.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3>Education, peace, and social change</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception over two decades ago, </span><a href="https://fredmednick.com/vita"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers Without Borders has received 15 awards and recognitions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including two Peace Prizes in 2018: The Luxembourg Peace Prize for efforts in peace-building through teacher professional development and the Ahmadiyya-Muslim Prize for the Advancement of Peace.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mednick credits the 2018 Ahmadiyya-Muslim Prize for the Advancement of Peace to teachers in Pakistan, Israel, Palestine, India, Rwanda, Burundi, Mexico, and Kenya. He says teachers in those countries emphasized peace in one&#8217;s home, peace in the classroom, and peace in one&#8217;s community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For current UC Santa Cruz students seeking social justice and change in their communities, Mednick offers some advice: &#8220;Please don&#8217;t let the fervency of your mission cloud your message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Social justice is not a clean, unencumbered path riding on fixed rails,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It is more often than not one step forward and two steps back. Do not rush to fix the injustices you see with magic solutions. Pay attention. You have two ears and one mouth, and they should be used in that proportion.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was something you hid, something to be ashamed of,&#8221; said the 19-year-old College Ten sophomore majoring in politics at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-forward to October 2021, when Safi&#8217;s work on a coalition pushing for menstrual equity in California saw Gov. Gavin Newsom sign AB 367 into law. The unfunded mandate requires all public schools grades 6&#8211;12, along with community and state universities, to stock restrooms with free menstrual products starting this year. (The bill excluded UC campuses.) The measure&#8217;s passage is what menstrual activists like Safi believe is a first step toward rectifying the discrimination, stigma, and financial, educational, and health consequences faced by those who menstruate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People don&#8217;t need to buy toilet paper and soap when they go into a public restroom, Safi said. &#8220;Just the idea of needing a quarter to pay for a necessary biological event is kind of ridiculous.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safi&#8217;s roots as a period equity activist began her senior year at Aragon High School in San Mateo County. There, she became bothered by stories from her friends, like the classmate whose menstrual period started during a physics test, could find no tampons or pads in the school restroom and sat bleeding through her clothes as she completed the exam. Not only was it hard for the girl to concentrate on the test, Safi said, but when she left school to go home to change, she received an unexcused absence for doing it.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About the same time, Safi said, she read the book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Period Power: A Manifesto for the Menstrual Movement</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Nadya Okamoto, which detailed the discrimination and health and education consequences around menstruation and also laid out ways to engage in activism around the topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a report from the American Civil Liberties Union titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unequal Price of Periods</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, those who menstruate can spend $1,000 over a lifetime on period products, placing a burden on those with low incomes. In addition, not only do some states tax tampons and pads while not taxing things like dandruff shampoo, for instance, but public assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program also don&#8217;t cover the purchase of menstrual products, the report noted. The result is those who can&#8217;t afford to buy menstrual products may resort to makeshift barriers like toilet paper or cardboard or they may use tampons longer than is recommended, leading to infections or a sometimes-fatal condition called Toxic Shock Syndrome, the report said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of menstrual supplies also may lead students to miss school and also feel shame whenever they are menstruating, said the report. For one in five American teenagers who live in poverty, the report noted, a lack of menstrual products and support can lead to lost educational opportunity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safi decided she could no longer stand by and do nothing. She founded the Period Project and approached school officials and the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors about having free menstrual products readily available in public high school restrooms in the region.&#160; She also enlisted the support of U.S. Congresswoman Jackie Speier (D-CA 14</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District).&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, San Mateo County supervisors approved $20,000 to fund a pilot project to supply free menstrual products in two low-income schools in the area. Speier also provided $5,000 from her own campaign funds to kickstart the project at Jefferson High School in Daly City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I applaud Amanda for her determination and commitment to provide her fellow students with period products and fight the stigma around menstruation,&#8221; said Speier. &#8220;She understands what a lack of access to these products can mean. &#8230; Our students should be focused on learning, not worrying about where to get a pad or a tampon during class time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After her local success, Safi joined the statewide coalition to push for passage of AB 367. One day, she said, she hopes a similar measure may be approved on a national basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her advocacy work has not only diminished her earlier stigma around menstruation &#8212; she said she now openly carries period products on her way to a restroom &#8212; but it has given her a feeling of power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of the time, growing up [in a traditional household], I felt like I didn&#8217;t have a voice and felt like I wasn&#8217;t heard,&#8221; said the first-generation college student. &#8220;It was a product of having conflicting values and wanting my own independence. I started to volunteer with this political campaign as a way to get my own voice heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I found the power of my voice.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c7499fee8072704671ace4173599fe5e"><name>da-kink-in-my-hair</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Stories of Black women take center stage in upcoming performance of  ''da Kink in My Hair'</title><summary>The award-winning play "‘da Kink in My Hair" will be presented February 18-27 by the Department of Performance, Play &amp; Design and the African American Theater Arts Troupe.&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centered around hairdresser and narrator Novelette who has the power to reveal her clients&#8217; innermost thoughts by touching their hair, the play&#8212;told through a series of monologues, music, and dance&#8212;gives voice to a group of eight Black women who tell unforgettable, moving, sometimes painful and often hilarious stories about the hardship, struggles, and joys of their lives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8217;da Kink</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been staged across Canada, the United States, and England and has consistently broken box office records since its premiere. It was adapted for a TV Series on the Global Television Network, becoming the first comedy series created by and starring Black women in Canada. It is the recipient of four NAACP Theatre Awards and was named one of the top ten plays in Canada's theatrical history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The hair salon is Black women&#8217;s safe space to speak our mind and be heard without judgment, just understanding,&#8221; says Sandrine Bekono, a third year Sociology major who is making her AATAT debut in the role of Trina. &#8220;The play is a window into the world of a Black woman and what most of us go through, living in the skin that we did not choose. As Black women, we don&#8217;t have our stories told, especially in the medium of theater. This production centers the culture that we have been able to cultivate among ourselves.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hearing these stories, told with real freshness and authenticity, generates a greater appreciation and understanding of Black life,&#8221; says director Don Williams, AATAT&#8217;s founder as well as the Artistic Director of the Cultural Arts and Diversity Resource Center. &#8220;It wakes us up to what Black women are going through, and it&#8217;s so relatable. Audiences will think &#8216;Hey, that&#8217;s my family too!&#8217; We learn from everyone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams founded AATAT in 1991 to bring visibility and understanding of Black culture to the campus and as a means for Black students, who make up just 4% of the student population, to have their voices, histories, and communities represented. AATAT has been a home away from home for over 1000 Black students since its inception, welcoming any student regardless of division affiliation or theater experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committed also to recruiting students of color to higher education, each year for over 20 years, AATAT has brought its current production to high schools and community theaters in Seaside, Monterey County. This year, AATAT will present a free performance on March 5 at Monterey Peninsula College for community members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the run of performances on the UCSC campus February 18-27, playwright Trey Anthony will offer a special, in person talk on February 26 after that night&#8217;s performance. Anthony will also be conducting a free, in person masterclass for both UCSC students and the general public on February 24 at 7 p.m. Sponsors for the masterclass includ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e UCSC Division of Arts, John Lewis College, and Bookshop Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tickets for performances of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;da Kink in My Hair </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be purchased </span><a href="https://ucsctickets.universitytickets.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online</span></a>.</p>

The medal is awarded annually in recognition of exceptional contributions to the biogeosciences.</p>
<p>Paytan studies chemical and biological processes in the oceans, how they have changed over time, and how they are affected by human activities. Her research includes studies of groundwater discharge into coastal systems, nutrient cycling, carbon storage in coastal wetlands, ocean acidification, and paleoceanography.</p>
<p>&#8220;An overarching goal of my research is to link changes observed in the earth and ocean systems to global changes in climate and tectonics, with an emphasis on human impacts,&#8221; Paytan said.</p>
<p>A fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), Association of Limnologists and Oceanographers (ASLO), and the Geochemical Society, Paytan is internationally recognized for her leadership and scientific accomplishments. Her awards and honors include the 2019 A.G.

In celebration of that milestone, events were held around the world, including some overseen by Santa Cruz&#8217;s own Dante Alighieri Society. But while UC Santa Cruz literature professor and Dante expert Filippo Gianferrari considered following suit, he chose to hold off on observing the poet&#8217;s passing in 1321 until this year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was a bit annoyed that there were so many things going on,&#8221; said Gianferrari with a laugh. &#8220;It just seemed a bit hysterical. So I thought, &#8216;Yes, let&#8217;s do something but let&#8217;s take a different approach. Not a way to commemorate the poet and his achievements but more a way to engage with him critically.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, Gianferrari is helping organize a new series called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the Margins: Dante 701 Years Later.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Funded through the Siegfried B. and Elisabeth Mignon Puknat Literary Studies Endowment and presented by The Humanities Institute, the series will include events taking place throughout 2022 to engage with Dante&#8217;s work through a much different lens than the usual discussions of his life and work. While he is rightfully placed on a pedestal for his startling visions of the afterlife in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and his lyric poetry, which are still resonating within popular culture some seven centuries after they were written, Dante was, in Gianferrari&#8217;s view, &#8220;a marginal intellectual during his lifetime&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He was really working from the margins,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He was a layperson. He was not necessarily academically trained. He was exiled from his city. He decided to write in the vernacular, which was not the language of the learned establishment.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">From The Margins</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> event, an online webinar at 5:30pm today (Feb. 7), is a perfect encapsulation of how far-reaching Dante&#8217;s influence continues to be. </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/from-the-margins-dante-701-years-later-reading-dante-seeking-freedom-fleeing-racism/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reading Dante, Seeking Freedom, Fleeing Racism</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be a discussion of how Black writers have been using </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as inspiration for their own writing and re-interpreting its narrative as commentary on segregation and integration. The event will be recorded and available to view on the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz7BTIgd_GBKn9B65328bjw/videos?view=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Arts and Lectures YouTube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> channel.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping lead the discussion is Dennis Looney, a professor of Italian and Classics at University of Pittsburgh, and the author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom Readers: The African American Reception of Dante Alighieri and the Divine Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, published by University of Notre Dame Press in 2011.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot written about the reception of Dante by the poets that worked around Harvard like Longfellow,&#8221; said Gianferri, &#8220;but what Looney does with his book is tell a different story. The African American reception of Dante shows a very different view of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They saw the poem as one that does not serve established, imperialistic power but one that goes against it.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The series continues on Feb 22 with a virtual event, co-sponsored by The Humanities Institute and the Center for Middle East and North Africa, called </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/from-the-margins-dante-701-years-later-dantes-mediterranean-awakening/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dante&#8217;s Mediterranean Awakening</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The conversation, moderated by UC Santa Cruz literature professor Sharon Kinoshita and featuring Karla Mallette, professor of Italian and Mediterranean Studies at the University of Michigan, will focus on the years Dante spent in exile from his home in Florence. As he traveled throughout Italy, the poet learned about the new technologies and new intellectual practices brought to the country from elsewhere including the teachings of Islam and new perspectives on the afterlife.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the fall, says Gianferri, UC Santa Cruz will host another talk about Primo Levi, the Italian scientist and author best known for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If This Is A Man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, his account of his arrest as part of the anti-fascist movement in Italy and subsequent incarceration at the Auschwitz concentration camp. During his imprisonment, Levi began to recall the Dante poems he learned in school. In particular, he recited Canto XXVI from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dante&#8217;s interpretation of the story of Ulysses&#8217; last voyage, and attempted to translate into French for one of his fellow prisoners.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all of these events only prove one thing, it&#8217;s that Dante has achieved something all-too-rare in the world of literature: longevity. There aren&#8217;t many writers whose work is still being discussed and analyzed and recontextualized for modern readers and scholars some seven centuries after it was printed for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s an incredible accomplishment for someone who, Gianferrari emphasizes, spent his most important years living and writing outside the boundaries of his home country&#8217;s cultural center.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t a professor giving voice to the official academic view of his time,&#8221; said Gianferrari. &#8220;He was not a priest. He was not a theologian. He was almost like a songwriter nowadays. His poems raise issues that are really difficult to address and because of that, they are still very much alive today.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d6c7d1458072704671ace41727d4bb2b"><name>cp-evc-staff-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>February 17th Staff Forum with CP/EVC</title><summary>The Staff Advisory Board seeks to continue supporting staff by amplifying your voices to campus leadership. </summary><start-date>1644220800000</start-date><display-name>February 17th Staff Forum with CP/EVC</display-name><path>/2022/02/cp-evc-staff-forum</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/02/cp-evc-staff-forum</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1644280926511</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1644280960853</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>We hope this email finds you and your family safe and well, despite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz is one of just six Research 1 (R1) universities that have had at least three women at the helm, according to a new report conducted by the&#160;</span><a href="https://www.womenspowergap.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women&#8217;s Power Gap Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;(WPG) at the Eos Foundation, in partnership with the&#160;</span><a href="https://www.aauw.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Association of University Women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;(AAUW). The study looks at private and public universities with R1 designation, the highest research ranking awarded to universities with doctoral programs by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions in Higher Education.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer, the </span><a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/about/leadership-team.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top administrative and academic leadership teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are composed of administrators from diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and identities.&#160; Sixty percent of the Chancellor&#8217;s Cabinet, 38 percent of the academic deans and 36 percent of tenured professors are women.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am extremely proud that UC Santa Cruz has been recognized for diversifying university leadership at all levels,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;We&#8217;ve used inclusive recruitment best practices, we&#8217;ve developed leadership programs, and we focus effort on creating diverse applicant pools. It makes a tremendous difference.&#8221;&#8232;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s important that students see themselves in campus leadership, she added. Diversity of all types is key to inclusion and creating a welcoming campus where everyone has a sense of belonging.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Breaking barriers to leadership</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At UC Santa Cruz, increasing diversity in the broadest sense is a campus priority. This includes and is not limited to, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geographical origin, disability, intellectual interest, gender, sexual orientation, and religious and ideological beliefs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university continues to implement its diverse leadership priorities as it searches for the best candidates to fill leadership positions. Recent appointments include Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success Akirah J. Bradley-Armstrong, a dedicated student affairs professional with 17 years of experience in the field, and Dean of the Arts Division Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu, a leading scholar of race, sexuality, and representations in transnational popular culture.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Faculty and staff leadership</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Part of meeting the academic needs of our students is ensuring they see themselves in the leadership and faculty of our university,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer. &#8220;Our priority to continue to transform who is a leader and embrace the life experiences they bring will strengthen our community and prepare our students for their careers and their own leadership experiences.&#8221;&#160;<img alt="" height="400" src="images/hands-400px.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 7px;" width="400"/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through campus programs, faculty members develop their leadership skills and abilities. Each year, the </span><a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/programs/faculty-fellows-leadership-for-equity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leadership for Equity Faculty Fellows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, led by the Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning, provides 15 fellows the opportunity to build their knowledge and skills in educational and institutional equity through research, reflection, exploration, and practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the </span><a href="https://academicaffairs.ucsc.edu/leadership-academy/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leadership Academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brings together a diverse group of academic and staff employees each year to broaden their understanding of how the university operates, and develop their skills and knowledge to be successful leaders at UCSC. As a cohort they also start to build a network of campus partners.&#160; &#160; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Increasing faculty diversity</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university is also disrupting the status quo of who is a professor. Over the past ten years, the Senate faculty has gone from 12.6% to 17% under-represented minority (Latinx, Indigenous, or Black). This increase is the result of inclusive hiring practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university has been awarded a number of grants to initiate projects is participating in a number of projects to increase faculty diversity including the Faculty Community Networking program, which provides support groups for Black faculty, AAPI faculty, Indigenous scholars, Latinx faculty, women faculty in STEM, and faculty with disabilities and chronic illness, and the Faculty of Color and Leadership project, describing what leadership looks like to faculty of color and what barriers exist for getting more faculty of color into campus leadership</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC is famous for the mentorship provided by its world-class faculty to generations of students,&#8221; said Dean of the Division of Arts Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu. &#8220;Faculty diversity ensures a more inclusive curriculum that is key to student success. It is dazzling to see the abundance of new research areas opening up, as students and faculty collaborate to employ new methods and together explore a more global curriculum that decenters the west.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 130 R1 universities nationally, only 22 percent have women leaders. At R1 public universities the number is slightly higher at 24 percent. The number of women serving as provosts and academic deans continues to rise, hitting a high of nearly 40 percent.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has also been an increase in the number of Black male university leaders, doubling since 2020. That isn&#8217;t the case for women of color (WOC), however. According to the report, women of color are only five percent of university presidents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While many institutions of higher education continue to overlook women and people of color for leadership positions, at UC Santa Cruz diversity is a core campus value at the heart of everything we do as leaders of change,&#8221; Kletzer said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dae463e58072704671ace417898edaca"><name>faculty-expansion</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz announces ambitious investment to hire 100 additional faculty over decade, part of broader effort to advance student success and research excellence</title><summary>To advance its place as an international leader at the intersection of innovation and social justice, UC Santa Cruz announced today its intention to prioritize faculty hiring by adding 100 additional faculty over the next decade.</summary><start-date>1644307200000</start-date><display-name>Faculty expansion</display-name><path>/2022/02/faculty-expansion</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/02/faculty-expansion</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1644349907922</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1644358170239</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Research</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/02/images/faculty-collage-500px.png</path><link>site://news/2022/02/images/faculty-collage-500px.png</link><site>news</site><name>faculty-collage-500px.png</name><display-name>faculty-collage-500px.png</display-name><file-size>416333</file-size><width>500</width><height>500</height></image><image-alt>Collage of four faculty members</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/02/faculty-80px.png</path><link>site://news/2022/02/faculty-80px.png</link><site>news</site><name>faculty-80px.png</name><display-name>faculty-80px.png</display-name><file-size>14793</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Collage of four faculty members</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UCSC will have an unparalleled opportunity to advance its research impact, diversify its faculty, and provide greater access to research and learning opportunities for its students.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The UC Santa Cruz community will come together in conversation this academic year about a campus-wide strategy to advance campus goals and guide this initiative</article-subhead><article-text><p>To advance its place as an international leader at the intersection of innovation and social justice, UC Santa Cruz announced today its intention to prioritize faculty hiring by adding 100 additional faculty over the next decade. It is the most significant faculty hiring effort the campus has pursued since its founding more than 50 years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a transformative investment in our campus and will have long-lasting impacts on our students, research enterprise and future as a university,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;We are going to amplify our positive impact on California and the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coupled with an anticipated 200 to 250 additional faculty hires to replace departures due to retirement and separations, UCSC will have an unparalleled opportunity to advance its research impact, diversify its faculty, and provide greater access to research and learning opportunities for its students.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an incredible moment for our campus community to share big ideas about how to advance both student success and our research mission,&#8221; Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer. &#8220;I am excited to see what this planning process and subsequent faculty growth can achieve.&#8221;</p>
<p>This planned series of campus conversations will guide the transformation of UCSC&#8217;s interdisciplinary education and research enterprise to create the vision for the campus of 2032 as an innovative student-centered research university, equipped to innovate solutions for the world&#8217;s greatest challenges.</p>
<p>The conversations will also include the development of a strategic vision for enhancing the student experience, evaluating staffing levels and roles as the mix of in-person, hybrid and remote modalities evolve, reexamining space utilization and, taking advantage of the 2021 Long Range Development Plan, developing a timeline for constructing new academic buildings, and student and employee housing to support the campus&#8217;s education and research mission.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has the highest ratio of students to faculty in the UC system, and at the current enrollment 72 additional faculty members would be required to move the ratio to the systemwide average.</p>
<p>This prioritization of faculty hiring is one part of a multipronged strategy to advance student success, increase the impact of campus research, and foster a more inclusive campus climate.</p>
<p>The Student Success Initiative, announced in fall 2021, is a wide-ranging effort to increase financial support for undergraduate and graduate students, and advance their access to the guidance and experiences fundamental to their education and ultimately future success.</p>
<h3>Continuing to be a great neighbor</h3>
<p>Chancellor Larive said it is critical for the campus to ensure there is both campus housing and academic and research space available for new faculty members as well as the students they&#8217;ll be teaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;Available and affordable housing is needed for our students as well as for our employees,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;Our new long-range development plan, which was informed by regular and extensive community engagement, forecasts building significantly more housing.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz plans to add housing for 100 percent of new full-time student enrollment above 19,500 and housing for up to 25 percent of new employees, based on demand.</p>
<p>While the plan to hire more faculty is rooted in the academic mission, the entire campus must work to develop a comprehensive plan to ensure the future success of UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<h3>Faculty guidance, mentorship critical in student success</h3>
<p>One of the campus&#8217;s highest priorities is advancing student success by increasing retention rates, eliminating achievement gaps, and ensuring students are able to graduate in a timely manner. Faculty are a critical component in a student&#8217;s experience and a defining characteristic of a UC education, Kletzer said.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of Senate faculty members will lower the campus student-to-faculty ratio and create more opportunities for students to join in research and creative scholarship, experiences that contribute to their academic success while also preparing them for successful careers. They will also further enrich the student experience by creating new courses and areas of study for both undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<h3>Building on excellence and pursuing new areas of inquiries</h3>
<p>The new faculty positions&#8212;coupled with an anticipated 200 to 250 additional recruitments needed to replace faculty who retire or leave the university&#8212;provide an unparalleled opportunity to make bold new investments, Kletzer said.</p>
<p>Using practices such as cluster hiring and target of excellence recruitments, UC Santa Cruz will attract new faculty members who will be part of a new generation of scholars leading at the intersection of innovation and social justice.</p>
<h3>Further advancing diversity and strengthening a feeling of belonging</h3>
<p>Over the past ten years, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Senate faculty has gone from 12.6% to 17% historically under-represented minority (Latinx, Indigenous, or Black). This progress is the result of intentional efforts that consider contributions to diversity statements and other inclusive hiring practices that have been shown to be effective in producing diverse candidate pools at each stage of the hiring process.</p>
<p>This effort will be amplified as UC Santa Cruz seeks to expand its faculty while prioritizing diversity reflected through research, gender, identity, intersectionality, race, ethnicity, life experience, and more. The goal is to have a faculty that reflects the diversity of the student body and can help further a feeling of belonging among students while pushing forward the frontiers of world-class research.</p>
<p>&#8220;The strength of UC Santa Cruz begins with the faculty, and I am so thrilled about what this faculty hiring initiative will mean to our students, to our campus and to California,&#8221; Chancellor Larive said. &#8220;This is a moment unlike any other.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conversations we will have in the coming years will be critical to achieving the university&#8217;s goals of advancing student success, elevating its research profile and impact, strengthening a sense of belonging among students, faculty, and staff, and ensuring effective, efficient, sustainable and resilient operations.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

campus financial aid office and various campus units that manage endowed scholarships and fellowships across campus</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of continuing and incoming UC Santa Cruz students will benefit from additional financial support from scholarships and fellowships after the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board approved an additional, one-time payout from the university&#8217;s endowment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the UC Santa Cruz Foundation endowment recording an extraordinarily strong investment year in fiscal year 2021, and inspired by the campus&#8217;s new </span><a href="https://success.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Success Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the foundation voted Saturday to increase the endowment&#8217;s payout this year by more than $900,000 of additional financial support for students directed through approximately 130 endowment-funded scholarships and fellowships. This represents a one-time 50 percent increase over what it provided in the fall to all UCSC endowments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The foundation&#8217;s endowment distribution policy is designed to smooth over the highs and lows of annual market volatility; however, FY21 results were distinctive and unprecedented,&#8221; said Richard Moss, chair of the Foundation Board of Trustees. &#8220;While our primary focus is on providing long-term resources for the university, we also know that there is real need now among our students. The board saw an opportunity to show additional support now by directing a small portion of the extraordinary returns that the endowment received in 2021 to further support students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundation works in close partnership with Chancellor Cynthia Larive and other university leaders to steward and advance private philanthropic support for the campus mission, while also fostering greater understanding throughout the broader community and state of UCSC's activities and impact. It provides stewardship for the $156 million endowment, which is a collection of funds created through philanthropy to support the university&#8217;s mission. The foundation&#8217;s endowment, coupled with the campus&#8217;s endowment held with the UC Regents, makes up the total endowment support received from philanthropy to support the long-term advancement of the UC Santa Cruz Campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is focused on leveraging all of our available resources to ensure our students have the support they need to make the most of their college experience and are prepared for their lives after graduation,&#8221; Chancellor Larive said. &#8220;I applaud my colleagues on the board for making this bold move and especially for providing this additional support for our students.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These funds will come at an important time,&#8221; said Director of Financial Aid Patrick Register. &#8220;While UC Santa Cruz, like campuses across the country, received additional student support from federal and state resources during the COVID-pandemic, we don&#8217;t expect many of those sources to be renewed.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Student Success Initiative, launched in fall 2021, is a wide-ranging effort to increase financial support for undergraduate and graduate students, and advance their access to the guidance and experiences fundamental to their education and ultimately future success. Through this five-year initiative, UC Santa Cruz will enhance its existing resources and develop new programs, opportunities, and other means of support for our students.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="db9af4dc8072704671ace41779847519"><name>kuper-wins-nsf-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Computer scientist Lindsey Kuper wins NSF CAREER award</title><summary>Lindsey Kuper, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has won a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to fund her lab’s study of distributed systems.</summary><start-date>1644361200000</start-date><path>/2022/02/kuper-wins-nsf-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/02/kuper-wins-nsf-award</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1644361872585</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1644361872585</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/02/images/kuper-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/02/images/kuper-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kuper-200.jpg</name><display-name>kuper-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>32517</file-size><width>200</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt>Headshot of Assistant Professor Lindsey Kuper.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/02/images/kuper-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/02/images/kuper-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kuper-80.jpg</name><display-name>kuper-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>17700</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Headshot of Assistant Professor Lindsey Kuper.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Assistant Professor Lindsey Kuper was awarded with an NSF CAREER award to fund her study of distributed systems.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Lindsey Kuper, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has won a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to fund her lab&#8217;s study of distributed systems.&#160;</p>
<p>Many people rely on distributed systems, networks of one or more computers that communicate with each other, in their daily work and personal lives while using Zoom, sharing files, and playing online games. These ubiquitous systems have a constant possibility of failure from problems such as internet or hardware errors, and are notoriously difficult to program &#8211; an issue that Kuper and her students will tackle with the funds from this grant.&#160;</p>
<p>The grant will enable Kuper to meld her interests and background across computer science areas such as programming languages (PL) and software verification to improve and build confidence in distributed systems. Her lab will do this by using and improving on tools based on refinement types, powerful and relatively easy-to-use approaches to ensure a program works correctly before the program is run.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to apply PL ideas to reasoning about and building better distributed systems,&#8221; Kuper said. &#8220;In the PL philosophy we try to reason about the way software behaves in a rigorous way, and in a very general way. I&#8217;m taking that way of thinking and applying it to the hard problems of building distributed systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kuper hopes to use this funding to create more approachable ways for newer students to study distributed systems, which are deeply relevant in computer science careers but are often not taught in undergraduate and even graduate level courses.&#160;</p>
<p>Undergraduate students in her lab will create educational materials such as videos and zines about distributed systems. These projects are meant to deepen the students&#8217; understanding but also involve younger students in informal research conversations and make the area of study less intimidating for others.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to the intrinsic value of this work &#8211; building confidence in complex systems &#8211; this project emphasizes the importance of communicating these concepts, and provides undergraduates with the opportunity to develop creative, open-source materials,&#8221; said Alex Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="df443b958072704671ace417dfee99f4"><name>presidential-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>White House honors astronomer Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz with mentoring award</title><summary>The Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring represent the highest honors bestowed upon mentors who work to expand STEM talent.</summary><keywords>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</keywords><start-date>1644393600000</start-date><display-name>White House honors astronomer Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz with mentoring award</display-name><path>/2022/02/presidential-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/02/presidential-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1644423297922</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1645503553093</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/02/images/ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/02/images/ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</name><display-name>ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>104843</file-size><width>350</width><height>451</height></image><image-alt>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/02/images/ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/02/images/ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20854</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz (Photo by Steve Kurtz)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring represent the highest honors bestowed upon mentors who work to expand STEM talent</article-subhead><article-text><p>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, has been honored by the White House with a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM).</p>
<p>PAESMEM recognizes the critical role mentors play in encouraging the next generation of innovators and developing a science and engineering workforce that reflects the country's diverse talent. Ramirez-Ruiz is among 12 individuals and 3 organizations named as the 2022 recipients of the PAESMEM awards by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The awards, along with the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, were announced February 8 by the White House.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am deeply appreciative of the inspiration that America&#8217;s teachers and mentors provide every day to support the next generation of STEM professionals,&#8221; President Joe Biden said in a White House statement. &#8220;The dedication these individuals and organizations have demonstrated to prepare students for careers in STEM fields, during what has been a difficult time for teachers, students, and families, plays a huge role in American innovation and competitiveness. The work that teachers and mentors do ensures that our Nation&#8217;s children are able to unlock&#8212;for themselves and all of us&#8212;a world of possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz, who holds UCSC&#8217;s Vera Rubin Presidential Chair for Diversity in Astronomy, has been building STEM training research programs at UC Santa Cruz for over 14 years. His mentees encompass more than 200 students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty. In addition to his record of success as a research adviser, the mentoring program he created, called Lamat (&#8220;star&#8221; in Mayan), has been remarkably successful at increasing the number of historically marginalized students who earn Ph.D.s in astrophysics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Receiving a Presidential Award is an unexpected privilege. Sharing a lineage of intentions and inspirations with former awardees is startling and deeply moving,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz said. &#8220;In the end, I hope my greatest contribution to science is not any particular discovery but the creation of a new way of thinking that enables a great multitude of students from racially, ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse families to make their own discoveries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lamat program helps students from community colleges transfer to four-year institutions and on to graduate school. Women and historically marginalized students comprise 83 percent of the 93 Lamat participants since its inception in 2010. Ramirez-Ruiz personally mentored 33 Lamat students and 39 graduate and postdoctoral fellows in his laboratory. Twelve of them have won NASA postdoctoral fellowships, the most prestigious in the field, and 19 are now professors. Ramirez-Ruiz and the Lamat program have together trained half of all historically marginalized students receiving astronomy Ph.D.s in the United States in the past five years.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz served as chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at UCSC from 2015 to 2019<strong>, </strong>leaving an enduring legacy of equity and inclusion. Today, 30 percent of the department&#8217;s Ph.D. students are from historically marginalized groups, an exceptional figure for one of the top-ranked astronomy programs in the country.</p>
<p>Since joining the UCSC faculty in 2007, Ramirez-Ruiz has won a number of awards for his research, including a Packard Fellowship, an NSF CAREER Award, the Bouchet Award from the American Physical Society, and the HEAD Mid-Career Prize from the American Astronomical Society. In 2020, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 2021 he received the American Physical Society&#8217;s Dwight Nicholson Medal for Outreach. He earned a B.S. in physics from the Universidad Nacional Aut&#243;noma de M&#233;xico and a Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of Cambridge.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/02/images/enrico-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/02/images/enrico-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>enrico-featured.jpg</name><display-name>enrico-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>119203</file-size><width>590</width><height>241</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</thumb-alt><title>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz: Stellar Mentor</title><description>Astronomer Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz was honored by the White House with a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, the highest honors bestowed upon mentors who work to expand STEM talent.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="df6642568072704671ace4171884c3c8"><name>stellers-sea-cow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Genome of extinct Steller’s sea cow reveals surprising link to human skin disease</title><summary>Analysis of ancient DNA from sea cow bones finds genes that may have played a role in adaptation to cold marine environment and yields evidence of a long population decline.</summary><keywords>Beth Shapiro, Steller's sea cow</keywords><start-date>1644393600000</start-date><display-name>Genome of extinct Steller’s sea cow reveals surprising link to human skin disease</display-name><path>/2022/02/stellers-sea-cow</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/02/stellers-sea-cow</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1644425527875</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1644425899353</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/02/images/stellers-sea-cow-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/02/images/stellers-sea-cow-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stellers-sea-cow-500.jpg</name><display-name>stellers-sea-cow-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>68216</file-size><width>500</width><height>281</height></image><image-alt>Steller's sea cow</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/02/images/stellers-sea-cow-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/02/images/stellers-sea-cow-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stellers-sea-cow-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>stellers-sea-cow-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19487</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Steller's sea cow</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>An illustration of the now extinct Steller&#8217;s sea cow based on Steller&#8217;s description from 1741.

A new genomic analysis by an international team of scientists has now uncovered the genetic underpinnings of some of the most unusual features of Steller&#8217;s sea cows, including their thick, bark-like skin.</p>
<p>The new findings, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/sciadv.abl6496">published February 4 in <em>Science Advances</em></a>, are based on ancient DNA extracted from the bones of 12 Steller&#8217;s sea cows. The researchers compared the sea cow genomes with a newly assembled genome of the dugong, its closest living relative, as well as with genomes of manatees, cetaceans, and other marine mammals.</p>
<p>Demographic analyses of the sea cow genomes enabled estimates of past population sizes and indicated that the population of Steller&#8217;s sea cows had been in decline for a long time before it was pushed to extinction in the 18th century.</p>
<p>&#8220;The archeological record is not very good, but from the demographic analysis of the genomes it looks like their population had been declining for at least a half million years or so,&#8221; said Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, and a senior and corresponding author of the paper.</p>
<p>Steller&#8217;s sea cows were first described by German naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller, who encountered them in 1741 while shipwrecked on Bering Island. In his posthumously published report, he described their skin as resembling &#8220;more the bark of an old oak tree, than the skin of an animal.&#8221;</p>
<p>In their genomic analysis, Shapiro&#8217;s colleagues found that two genes associated with skin development were inactivated in Steller&#8217;s sea cows. The genes code for lipoxygenase enzymes. Remarkably, these same genes are inactivated by mutations in humans who are affected by a skin disease, called ichthyosis, characterized by thick, rough skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can only speculate about what drove this adaptation in Steller&#8217;s sea cows,&#8221; said co-first author Molly Cassatt-Johnstone, a researcher in Shapiro&#8217;s Paleogenomics Lab at UCSC. &#8220;The thick skin could very well have helped them maintain their core temperature in cold water, and it could also have been defensive or protective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scanning the genomes of other marine mammals, the researchers found that the lipoxygenase genes inactivated in Steller&#8217;s sea cows are also inactivated in whales and other cetaceans, but are active in seals, sea lions, sea otters, polar bears, dugongs, and manatees. Cetaceans shed their outer layer of skin rapidly, which prevents the buildup of thick skin that would otherwise occur in the absence of the lipoxygenase enzymes.</p>
<p>The researchers also found similarities between Steller&#8217;s sea cows and cetaceans in certain genes involved in energy metabolism, suggesting that both lineages evolved similar adaptations to cold-water habitats. The development of the same adaptations in unrelated species is known as convergent evolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case, Steller&#8217;s sea cows and whales have independently evolved mutations in the same genes, multiple times in different lineages,&#8221; Cassatt-Johnstone said.</p>
<p>Steller&#8217;s sea cows once inhabited shallow coastal waters around the Pacific Rim from California to Japan, but by the time of Steller&#8217;s voyage they were restricted to the waters around the Commander Islands (which include Bering Island). The genetic evidence of a long-term decline suggests that environmental changes played a role, but the extinction of the last remaining population was caused by humans.</p>
<p>The sea cows were hunted by fur traders for their meat and blubber. In addition, the kelp forests they depended on for food may have collapsed as a result of human hunting of sea otters, which maintain kelp forests by controlling sea urchin populations. That possibility was proposed by coauthor James Estes and others in a 2016 paper. In any event, the last recorded sighting of a Steller&#8217;s sea cow was in 1768.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a long, slow decline, and then we killed off the last population,&#8221; Shapiro said.</p>
<p>The study was motivated in part by the team&#8217;s interest in the sea cow&#8217;s warm-water relatives, the dugong and manatees, which are currently endangered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Genomes from the past can help us understand species today,&#8221; Shapiro said. &#8220;Understanding how the sea cow adapted to cold-water environments can provide insights into these endangered warm-water species, which we are studying now.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Shapiro, the other corresponding authors of the paper are Michael Hofreiter at University of Potsdam and Torsten Schoneberg at University of Leipzig in Germany. The first authors, in addition to Cassatt-Johnstone, are Diana Le Duc at University Medical Center Leipzig and Velluva Akhil at Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. Coauthors also include researchers at Stockholm University in Sweden, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan, UC Irvine, Russian Academy of Science, and additional institutions in Germany and Sweden. This work was supported by the German Research Foundation and University of Leipzig Clinician Scientist Program.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dffb278b8072704671ace417352bb7ca"><name>additional-senate-faculty</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Creating a shared vision to increase our faculty to advance student success, research enterprise</title><summary>We are thrilled to announce today an ambitious effort to hire 100 additional Senate faculty over the next decade. </summary><start-date>1644307200000</start-date><display-name>Creating a shared vision to increase our faculty to advance student success, research enterprise</display-name><path>/2022/02/additional-senate-faculty</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/02/additional-senate-faculty</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1644435285882</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648053315386</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are thrilled to announce today an ambitious effort to <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/02/faculty-expansion.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1644521553877000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ZWhJqyjMIaYjeXgR7cID6" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/02/faculty-expansion.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hire 100 additional Senate faculty over the next decade</a>. These new positions are part of a broader effort to advance student success and research excellence, firmly establishing UC Santa Cruz as a global leader at the intersection of innovation and social justice, amplifying our positive impact on California, the nation, and the world.</p>
<p>These hires &#8212; the most significant faculty-hiring effort our campus has pursued since its founding nearly 60 years ago &#8212; will be transformative. Students will experience the benefits of a lower student-to-faculty ratio, have access to new courses and areas of study, and discover more opportunities to join in research and creative scholarship, experiences that contribute to academic and later professional success. The faculty additions will strengthen our academic and research enterprises, allowing us to move quickly into emerging fields and to build on existing areas of excellence. The new hires, plus 200 to 250 additional faculty hires anticipated over the next decade due to faculty retirement and separations, provides an unparalleled opportunity to increase the diversity of our faculty, which is already one of the most diverse in the UC system.</p>
<p>We aim to bring our campus community together during the year ahead for conversations that will inform this effort as we plan to increase the size of our faculty. This process will facilitate input on directions for future investments and inform the development of a comprehensive plan that will focus on ways to advance student success, expand our research excellence and increase faculty diversity. Staffing levels and roles will be analyzed, taking the evolution of in-person, online and hybrid instruction modalities into consideration. This strategic thinking will also explore how our operations and processes can support the future campus enterprise. We will re-examine opportunities for the utilization of campus space, with the aim of using it more effectively. We will lean hard on our 2021 Long Range Development Plan, supported unanimously by Regents this past fall, to develop a timeline for constructing student and employee housing, as well as new academic buildings.</p>
<p>The new housing and facilities piece of this equation is crucial as we plan for the future. New faculty members and the students they&#8217;ll be teaching will need places to live, work and study. That is why our long-range development plan, which was informed by regular and extensive community engagement, forecasts building significantly more housing. We plan to build housing for 100 percent of new full-time student enrollment above 19,500 and housing for up to 25 percent of new employees, based on demand.</p>

The new study compares where these scams are being reported among counties across the country. The findings reveal that social context&#8212;like whether local services and policies are designed to support or exclude immigrants&#8212;may affect the likelihood of scams being reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigration scams are a specialized type of fraud that preys upon immigrants, often by exploiting hopes of obtaining favorable legal status or fears of being deported. Fraudsters make threatening phone calls impersonating Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents to demand payments. Phishing emails claim the recipient has won a Green Card but must provide personal information in order to receive it. Fake websites mimic U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. And scammers who often call themselves </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">notarios</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or &#8220;consultants&#8221;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">offer immigration legal services while misrepresenting their qualifications.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impacts of these scams can be devastating for victims, but there&#8217;s still relatively little known about where they occur and how often. They&#8217;re reported to the federal government about as often as hate crimes against Hispanic people, who make up the largest immigrant-origin population in the United States. Experts believe both types of crimes are substantially underreported, in part because they target people who may not know their rights to report crimes or may be afraid that doing so would reveal their immigration status.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are probably a lot of people who suffer in silence, and the statistics just never capture it,&#8221; Pedroza said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information he obtained from the Federal Trade Commission showed that between 400 and 700 immigration scams were reported annually from 2011 to 2014. Pedroza says these 2,314 reports probably represent &#8220;just the tip of the iceberg,&#8221; in terms of the true extent of immigration scams. But they can still offer important insights about which regions contribute an outsized portion of scam reports and why that might be the case.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Pedroza used the FTC data to compare rates of immigration scam reporting in communities across the country, and he found that the size and proportion of local noncitizen populations explained some but not all of the variation in where reports were clustered.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scam reports were notably more common in communities with greater access to the social safety net&#8212;as measured by the local ratio of poor Hispanics to Hispanic households receiving food stamps&#8212;and in communities with experienced immigration lawyers, free or low cost legal aid, and language translation services for communicating with law enforcement. These services may support the immigration scam reporting process both directly and indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Positive experiences with the social safety net may potentially promote the idea that there are arms of the public sector that have your best interests in mind,&#8221; Pedroza explained. &#8220;And making sure that immigrants trust the public sector may be really important in helping people feel that reporting immigration scam crimes to law enforcement is a safe thing for them to do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles were all examples of communities with strong support services for immigrants that the study showed had a higher-than-expected number of immigration scam reports relative to local immigrant populations. Meanwhile, reports of immigration scams were less common in communities with high deportation rates and state-level laws targeting and criminalizing immigrants. Those included some counties with relatively large immigrant populations, especially in the Southeast and Southwest.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study can&#8217;t rule out the possibility that traditional immigrant destinations with high levels of support services may also be heavily targeted by scammers. But other research has shown that legal services scammers may actually prefer captive markets, where legitimate immigrant services are sparse. And Pedroza&#8217;s analysis found that online ads for immigration services&#8212;which scammers might use to look for victims&#8212;were substantially more common in communities with more restrictive policies toward immigrants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study also showed that reporting of immigration scams was correlated with reporting of anti-Hispanic hate crimes, but not with arrest data in a given community, which may indicate that the observed trends are more reflective of immigrants' willingness to claim their rights than of actual crime levels. If that&#8217;s the case, then offering immigrant support services may ultimately be a key factor in increasing access to justice for immigrants and holding scammers accountable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, one major challenge is that, currently, social and legal services for immigrants are unevenly distributed. Pedroza&#8217;s analysis showed that one-fifth of U.S. counties had high levels of access to food stamps for Hispanic households, and a 2007 survey found that only one-eighth of counties have multiple language interpretation options available for communicating with law enforcement. Meanwhile, 4% of counties had multiple nonprofit legal aid providers for immigrants, and 5% had multiple immigration lawyers with deportation experience, according to Pedroza&#8217;s analysis.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding these services to reach more immigrant communities might help to encourage more immigration scam reporting in more places, Pedroza says. His study also found that, in communities with a mix of both exclusionary policies and supportive services, one type of influence did not reliably outweigh the other in its relationship to levels of immigration scam reporting. Pedroza believes this may indicate the value of investing in immigrant services &#8220;anywhere and everywhere.&#8221;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even in places with policies that are exclusionary or hostile to immigrants, investing in access to legal services and social safety nets may still make a difference in immigration scam reporting,&#8221; Pedroza said. &#8220;And the alternative is clear: If we don't invest in these things, scam artists have total impunity to innovate and take advantage, and we&#8217;ll never even know how often it&#8217;s happening unless we put in the work to make immigrants feel safe in reporting it.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e556814b8072704671ace417740286e9"><name>fire-safety</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Campus Fire Safety and Awareness</title><summary>With the current dry conditions, the threat of fire on our campus is high and potentially devastating.

They were among the largest known floods in Earth&#8217;s history, and geologists struggling to reconstruct them have now identified a crucial factor governing their flows.</p>
<p>In a study <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/119/8/e2109502119.short?rss=1">published February 14 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, researchers showed how the changing weight of the ice sheets would have caused the entire landscape to tilt, changing the course of the megafloods.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have been looking at high water marks and trying to reconstruct the size of these floods, but all of the estimates are based on looking at the present-day topography,&#8221; said lead author Tamara Pico, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;This paper shows that the ice age topography would have been different over broad scales due to the deformation of Earth&#8217;s crust by the weight of the ice sheets.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the height of the last ice age, vast ice sheets covered much of North America. They began to melt after about 20,000 years ago, and the Missoula megafloods occurred between 18,000 and 15,500 years ago. Pico&#8217;s team studied how the changing weight of the ice sheets during this period would have tilted the topography of eastern Washington, changing how much water would flow into different channels during the floods.</p>
<h2>Glacial outburst floods</h2>
<p>Glacial Lake Missoula formed in western Montana when a lobe of the Cordilleran ice sheet dammed the Clark Fork valley in the Idaho panhandle and melt water built up behind the dam. Eventually the water got so deep that the ice dam began to float, resulting in a glacial outburst flood. After enough water had been released, the ice dam resettled and the lake refilled. This process is thought to have been repeated dozens of times over a period of several thousand years.</p>
<p>Downstream from glacial Lake Missoula, the Columbia River was dammed by another ice lobe, forming glacial Lake Columbia. When Lake Missoula&#8217;s outburst floods poured into Lake Columbia, the water spilled over to the south onto the eastern Washington plateau, eroding the landscape and creating the Channeled Scablands.</p>
<p>During this period, the deformation of the Earth&#8217;s crust in response to the growing and shrinking of ice sheets would have changed the elevation of the topography by hundreds of meters, Pico said. Her team incorporated these changes into flood models to investigate how the tilting of the landscape would have changed the routing of the megafloods and their erosional power in different channels.</p>
<p>&#8220;We used flood models to predict the velocity of the water and the erosional power in each channel, and compared that to what would be needed to erode basalt, the type of rock on that landscape,&#8221; Pico said.</p>
<p>They focused on two major channel systems, the Cheney-Palouse and Telford-Crab Creek tracts. Their results showed that earlier floods would have eroded both tracts, but that in later floods the flow would have been concentrated in the Telford-Crab Creek system.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the landscape tilted, it affected both where the water overflowed out of Lake Columbia and how water flowed in the channels, but the most important effect was on the spillover into those two tracts,&#8221; Pico said. &#8220;What&#8217;s intriguing is that the topography isn&#8217;t static, so we can&#8217;t just look at the topography of today to reconstruct the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>The findings provide a new perspective on this fascinating landscape, she said. Steep canyons hundreds of feet deep, dry falls, and giant potholes and ripple marks are among the many remarkable features etched into the landscape by the massive floods.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you are there in person, it&#8217;s crazy to think about the scale of the floods needed to carve those canyons, which are now dry,&#8221; Pico said. &#8220;There are also huge dry waterfalls&#8212;it&#8217;s a very striking landscape.&#8221;</p>

To Noah Finnegan, a geomorphologist who studies rivers, something about this landscape doesn&#8217;t look quite right.</p>
<p>&#8220;The river is really deep below the floodplain. That meadow at the entrance is the historical floodplain, and most natural rivers flood out of their channel every one to two years, but the San Lorenzo never floods in Henry Cowell,&#8221; said Finnegan, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>It was clear to Finnegan and his students that at some point in the past, the San Lorenzo River cut down into its channel and abandoned the floodplain. So they set out to determine when that happened and why. Their findings, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.5299">published in December in the journal <em>Earth Surface Processes and Landforms</em></a>, connect this dramatic change in the river&#8217;s behavior to logging practices in the Santa Cruz Mountains in the 1800s.</p>
<p>The researchers determined that the river is about 2 to 4 meters (6.5 to 13 feet) below where it would be if it were in equilibrium with the floodplain. Records from the U.S. Geological Survey&#8217;s streamflow gauge in Felton show that the river has risen over its banks only twice since 1987&#8212;in February 1998 and February 2017&#8212;and neither event involved widespread flooding in this area.</p>
<p>To understand when the deepening of the channel occurred, the researchers used radiocarbon dating.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to find charcoal in the floodplain sediments that could tell us when the material was deposited,&#8221; said William Chapman, a UCSC graduate student who led the study. &#8220;The latest dates we got from radiocarbon dating were between 200 and 400 years ago, so the river was still connected to its floodplain in the 1600s and probably into the 1800s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearcut logging was widespread in the Santa Cruz Mountains in the 1800s and early 1900s, bringing dramatic changes to the landscape. One common effect of logging is to increase erosion rates in the watershed by removing vegetation that holds soil in place, causing rivers and streams to become choked with excess sediments and silt. But this would raise the bed of the river rather than cutting a deeper channel.</p>
<p>Many common practices employed during the early days of logging, however, would lead to a deeper channel. Rivers were often used to transport logs, so the channel would be scoured by logs dragged along the bottom and the streambed would be cleared of any debris or logjams that might have slowed the flow of water. Loggers sometimes built &#8220;splash dams&#8221; to hold back water and then let it go all at once to move logs downstream.</p>
<p>A key factor in a river&#8217;s behavior is the balance between its &#8220;transport capacity&#8221;&#8212;how much sediment the river can carry during high flows&#8212;and the supply of sediment entering it from the surrounding landscape. If the sediment supply exceeds the transport capacity, the river will deposit sediments and elevate its bed. But if the transport capacity exceeds the sediment supply, the river will begin to cut down into its bed, deepening the channel in a process called &#8220;incision.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know for sure what logging practices were used in the Felton area, but anything that simplifies the channel, like skidding logs through the channel or pulling out logjams, leads to the river transporting sediment more efficiently,&#8221; Finnegan said. &#8220;When you change the hydraulics to move sediment more efficiently, the river will start to dig down, mining its own bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>A 2015 study of another watershed in the Santa Cruz Mountains north of Santa Cruz reported similar findings. Deep incision of Pescadero and Butano Creeks was attributed to well-documented historical logging practices, including log skidding in the channels and splash damming.</p>
<p>The abandonment of the floodplain has ecological consequences for species that use floodplain habitats, including salmon and steelhead. Now that the river has cut such a deep channel, however, there&#8217;s not much that can be done to restore it to the old floodplain. The river seems to be stable now, and in some places it appears to be forming a new floodplain below the old one.</p>
<p>&#8220;The river is where it wants to be now,&#8221; Chapman said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t reverse the incision of the river, but at that lower level it will erode the older banks to create a new equilibrium floodplain that could offer habitat for floodplain species.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finnegan said he has learned a lot about the history of the San Lorenzo Valley while studying the geomorphology of the river. He learned, for example, about a flume that was built to transport logs and a large gunpowder mill that operated on the banks of the river in the Paradise Park area, traces of which can still be seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s interesting to me is the intersection of history and archaeology and Earth science,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have a tendency to take for granted how things look in the natural world, but there are huge legacy effects of land use decisions made decades and centuries ago that still affect rivers today. The forests have grown back, so it&#8217;s hard to appreciate how extensively this area was logged and the impacts that had.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Chapman and Finnegan, the coauthors of the paper include Allison Pfeiffer at Western Washington University and SeanPaul La Selle at the U.S. Geological Survey.

Citing improving public health conditions in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom recently announced that he is letting the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR22-027.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1644953046035000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1MXYToGWiKA1zkjZaqi803" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR22-027.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statewide indoor mask mandate</a> expire <strong>tomorrow, Tuesday, Feb. 15</strong> . Eleven counties in the San Francisco Bay Area will subsequently lift their indoor mask mandates, including Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>This is a welcome step, as state health officials are beginning to plan for the &#8220;endemic&#8221; phase of COVID-19, in which the infection rate becomes more manageable. However, we know that our COVID mitigation measures on campus are working, and, as a community, the well being of our students, faculty, and staff remains our no. 1 priority. For these reasons, we simply cannot let our guard down yet.</p>
<p><strong>We have decided to continue the indoor masking requirement at all UC Santa Cruz facilities until further notice.</strong> I realize that this may be disappointing for some members of our campus community, and others may feel a profound sense of relief. At the two year mark of this pandemic, I recognize that almost all decisions bring divergent opinions. I also know that COVID-fatigue is real, but it cannot drive our decision making.</p>
<p>Masks are not required outdoors, and the warmer days offer us the opportunity to gather outside on campus to enjoy one another&#8217;s company.</p>
<p><strong>While indoor masking will continue, students will not have to fill out the daily symptom checker any longer.</strong> The symptom checker remains in place for employees as it is a Cal/OSHA requirement.</p>
<p>As public health conditions improve, campus leadership will reassess the need for indoor masking and other COVID mitigation measures. In the meantime, you may still pick up free upgraded masks at <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1644953046035000&amp;usg=AOvVaw23FzE4ZQNoj2BSsdU9eJD2" href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">various locations</a> across campus.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccination and regular testing also continues to be critical, which is why we need all members of our campus community to follow the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1644953046035000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1oeDoyhDeXn5UN7PltXG3H" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">asymptomatic testing requirements</a> and <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1644953046035000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2F_2jGKLgwxCrlZIdT0oBR" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">get boosted</a> as soon as they are eligible.</strong></p>

Sloan Foundation has awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship to Yuan Ping, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The prestigious two-year fellowship includes a grant of $75,000 to support Ping&#8217;s research, which focuses on developing first-principles computational platforms to study the physical processes critical to quantum information science. Awarded annually since 1955, the Sloan Research Fellowships honor early-career researchers whose creativity, innovation, and research accomplishments make them stand out as the next generation of leaders.</p>
<p>Ping&#8217;s research goal is to develop computational methods which can be used to design new, highly promising materials for quantum information science applications, including quantum computers, quantum communications, and quantum sensors. The critical physical processes in these emerging technologies are primarily quantum coherence (and decoherence), information readout, and quantum transduction.</p>
<p>In quantum technologies, information will be stored in quantum bits, or qubits, which can be made from any quantum system that has two states. One promising approach is based on the spin states of electrons. Ping&#8217;s group has developed a theoretical framework and computational tools for predicting spin dynamics in solid-state materials.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a computational materials scientist, my focus is on the development of new computational techniques that can accurately predict important materials properties for quantum information science and spintronics applications,&#8221; Ping said.</p>
<p>In addition to the Sloan Research Fellowship, within the past 14 months Ping has been awarded a National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the Young Investigator Research Program award from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and the American Chemical Society&#8217;s COMP OpenEye award for outstanding junior faculty.</p>
<p>Open to scholars in seven scientific and technical fields&#8212;chemistry, computer science, Earth system science, economics, mathematics, neuroscience, and physics&#8212;the Sloan Research Fellowships are awarded in close coordination with the scientific community. Candidates must be nominated by their fellow scientists, and winners are selected by independent panels of senior scholars on the basis of a candidate&#8217;s research accomplishments, creativity, and potential to become a leader in their field.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 researchers are nominated each year for 118 fellowship slots. Winners receive a two-year, $75,000 fellowship which can be used flexibly to advance the fellow&#8217;s research.</p>
<p>Founded in 1934, the <a href="https://sloan.org/">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a> is a not-for-profit, mission-driven grantmaking institution dedicated to improving the welfare of all through the advancement of scientific knowledge.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

runs from February 25 to March 6 at the  eXperimental Theater</article-subhead><article-text><p>The astonishing, true story of Austrian artist Oskar Kokoschka&#8217;s tempestuous love affair with composer Alma Mahler and the obsession that would drive him to commission a life-size doll in her likeness after their break up is the basis for a new musical making its world premiere February 25-March 6 at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s eXperimental Theater.</p>
<p>Presented by the Department of Performance, Play &amp; Design, directed by UCSC continuing lecturer Kirsten Brandt, and co-written by poet Amy Gerstler and composer Steve Gunderson, <em>The Artificial Woman</em> casts a feminist light on this chronicle of infatuation and fetish that unfolds in the artistic and intellectual hotbed that was Vienna just before World War I.</p>
<p>&#8220;This story hasn&#8217;t left me alone ever since I stumbled on it in grad school,&#8221; says Gerstler, who proposed it to Gunderson for their first time collaboration on a work of historical fiction. &#8220;It is fascinating, gripping, and raises so many questions about gender roles, women as muses, obsession and objectification, art making. The list goes on. Whenever I tell people about the young, avant-garde art star Kokoschka and Gustav Mahler&#8217;s widow, they say &#8216;No! This couldn&#8217;t have happened!&#8217; Then I Google one of the four existing photographs of the original doll, and it&#8217;s a total surprise to everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doll&#8212;which Kokoschka would dress, take to parties, and use as his studio model&#8212;plays a pivotal role in <em>The Artificial Woman</em> as its narrator and feminist center, speaking directly with the audience in Gerstler&#8217;s lyrical poetry to question all that it observes.</p>
<p>Much of <em>The Artificial Woman</em> is set to song. Gunderson composed more than 20 original pieces for the play that defy genre.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to create a unique musical universe for this since it exists in a space between fantasy and history,&#8221; says Gunderson. &#8220;Sometimes it leans towards opera and sometimes to musical theater. It&#8217;s a new musical world and not an easy one to perform, but the student performers have been brilliant and really risen to the challenge. We have gotten so much insight into this play from them.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>The Artificial Woman</em> was substantially reworked and refined through a quarter-long developmental workshop with UCSC theater arts students in spring 2021. The process was revelatory for the playwrights.</p>
<p>&#8220;The students had such important questions about the play and their characters,&#8221; says Gunderson. &#8220;It showed us so much about what would and wouldn&#8217;t work, and we made some big changes as a result.&#8221; Gerstler adds, &#8220;The students&#8217; level of professionalism is very high. What they came up with taught us so much about what the play is. It&#8217;s a gift to develop something like this with bright, active, engaged, talented, and questioning minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brandt, who led the workshopping process, notes, &#8220;It&#8217;s really terrific for our students to work with something brand new. They are seeing how the process works, which is a rarity. It&#8217;s joyous to wrestle with new material and be the first to make discoveries. And there&#8217;s a gorgeous complication to this show that makes the work so invigorating. The students have really relished the whole experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joining the eleven UCSC actors on stage will be a live band made up of UCSC music students on piano, synthesizer, upright bass, and drums. PhD student Michael Blackburn is the music director.</p>
<p>The premiere of <em>The Artificial Woman</em> runs from February 25-March 6.

Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>‘This Way to the Universe’ explains the outstanding mysteries of the universe and also how remarkably well we understand it on many levels</article-subhead><article-text><p>Throughout his career, UCSC physicist Michael Dine has explored challenging questions at the forefront of theoretical research in particle physics and cosmology. In a new book, <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/669740/this-way-to-the-universe-by-michael-dine/">This Way to the Universe</a> </em>(Penguin Random House, February 2022), Dine draws on decades of personal experience to offer an expert&#8217;s guide to the stunning achievements of modern physics as well as the mysteries that still confront scientists as they try to grasp the nature of reality.</p>
<p>His aim was to convey to a broad audience our current understanding of the universe from the smallest scales of subatomic particles to the largest scales of the cosmos.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a remarkably good idea of what the universe looks like over many orders of magnitude, from the very small-scale world of atomic nuclei and smaller to the very large scales,&#8221; Dine said. &#8220;There are outstanding mysteries that I talk about in the book, but I thought it was important to convey how much we do understand and how sharp our questions are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The discussions are grounded in stories, many featuring Dine&#8217;s colleagues at UC Santa Cruz, where he is a distinguished professor of physics and is affiliated with the <a href="https://scipp.science.ucsc.edu/">Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP)</a>. Dine is a leading theoretical physicist known for his contributions in the areas of supersymmetry and string theory, as well as investigations into the nature of dark matter and dark energy.</p>
<p>For over 30 years, Dine has been commuting to campus with a group of colleagues in physics and astronomy who live &#8220;over the hill&#8221; on the inland side of the Santa Cruz Mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;My car pool has not only educated me about a range of experimental issues but has helped keep me honest, focused on questions that either are driven by experiment or can be addressed by experiment,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;A de facto requirement of membership in this pool is the ability to explain to each other what we are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>In <em>This Way to the Universe</em>, Dine&#8217;s explanations of the mind-bending concepts of modern physics are accessible to anyone interested enough to follow along. He is an engaging and authoritative guide to the leading ideas in physics and cosmology, with an insider&#8217;s view of the latest developments.</p>
<p>Leonard Susskind, professor of theoretical physics at Stanford University and the author of several popular books, calls Dine&#8217;s book &#8220;an extraordinary journey...by one of the great masters of modern physics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike other books on the subject, it does not try to sell you on the author&#8217;s pet theory,&#8221; Susskind says. &#8220;In a clear and honest way, it lays out all the most important problems, puzzles, and potential solutions that modern physics faces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dine is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Physical Society (APS). He won the APS Sakurai Prize honoring outstanding achievement in particle physics theory and served as chair of the APS Committee on the Future of Theoretical Particle Physics. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1990 and received the Outstanding Faculty Award of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences in 2011.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="feb178698072704671ace4177c18873f"><name>its-vc-finalists</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Upcoming campus visits for Vice Chancellor of Information Technology finalists</title><summary>Beginning Tuesday, Feb. 22, we will be conducting the final interviews in the search for the Vice Chancellor for Information Technology.</summary><start-date>1644825600000</start-date><display-name>Upcoming campus visits for Vice Chancellor of Information Technology finalists</display-name><path>/2022/02/its-vc-finalists</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/02/its-vc-finalists</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1644950550610</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1644950550610</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning Tuesday, Feb. 22, we will be conducting the final interviews in the search for the Vice Chancellor for Information Technology.

The purpose of the new </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presidential Policy on University of California Research Data </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is to 1) clarify ownership of and responsibility for research data generated during the course of University Research, 2) encourage active data management practices, and 3) provide guidance with respect to procedures when a researcher leaves the University. The first systemwide review of the draft policy, entitled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presidential Policy on University of California Research Data and Tangible Research Material</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s, was launched on December 17, 2020. The Research Policy and Analysis (RPAC) unit within Research and Innovation received many thoughtful comments on the policy and made revisions based on that feedback, which is broadly summarized below.&#160;</span></p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Feedback on the Originally Disseminated Draft Policy&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feedback RPAC received regarding the proposed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presidential Policy on University of California Research Data and Tangible Research Materials </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">generally falls into four categories:</span></p>
<br/>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concern that the scope of the University&#8217;s ownership of research data and tangible research materials is too broad, including by:</span>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extending into works that are copyrightable or works that are personal&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imposing ownership on data and materials owned by third parties</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overreaching into tangible artifacts (e.g., archeological material excavated out of the ground)</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over how to implement the policy, including:</span>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">costs</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">management plans</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer process concerns regarding unintended impact on core research facilities performing services on a fee-for-service or recharge basis</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concerns over the unintended impact this policy might have on relationships with tribal nations</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<p><strong>Revisions to the Originally Disseminated Draft Policy based on Feedback&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RPAC made the following revisions and clarifications to the policy in response to the comments:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explained that the intent of the policy is to clarify ownership of and responsibility for Research Data generated during the course of University Research and provide guidance with respect to procedures when a researcher leaves the University</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revised the definition of Research Data and rewrote the text of the policy concerning ownership to clearly differentiate between those data owned by Regents and those data covered under the Copyright Ownership Policy</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noted that there are exceptions to UC&#8217;s ownership of Research Data when precluded by sponsorship or other related agreements</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removed the inclusion of tangible research materials in this policy</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revised the section of the policy related to procedures in the event that an investigator leaves the University</span></li>
</ol>

Davis and Associate Professor Gina Dent with colleagues Erica R. Meiners and Beth E. Richie, is garnering national attention for its pathbreaking examination of abolition and feminism in the 21st century.</p>
<p><em>Abolition. Feminism. Now.</em> is an urgent call by the four leading scholar-activists for a truly intersectional, internationalist, abolitionist feminism. Published by Haymarket Books, it demonstrates that abolitionism and feminism stand shoulder-to-shoulder in fighting a common cause: the end of the carceral state, with its key role in perpetuating violence, both public and private, in prisons, in police forces, and in people's homes. <em>Abolition. Feminism. Now.</em> argues that abolitionist theories and practices are at their most compelling when they are feminist; and a feminism that is also abolitionist is the most inclusive and persuasive version of feminism for these times.</p>
<p>Nia T. Evans of the Boston Review writes, &#8220;<em>Abolition. Feminism. Now.</em> is a demand in every way. It pushes readers not to accept simple stories but to embrace complexity and new ways of thinking. But it is also a celebration of feminist agitators and freedom fighters who undermine the carceral state while building new sources for safety, repair, and accountability. Of an ever-changing, growing, and evolving movement that puts survivors at the center of its analysis, not the periphery. And of a historic political struggle that considers freedom worth the fight. And, in the end, the authors make it clear that abolition feminism isn&#8217;t on its way; it&#8217;s already unfolding all around us.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>The full article and interview with the authors <a href="https://bostonreview.net/articles/why-policing-and-prisons-cant-end-gender-violence/">is available online</a>. The collaborating scholars were also recently interviewed on <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2022/1/19/abolition_feminism_now_beth_richie_gina">Democracy Now</a> and in <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a38746835/angela-davis-gina-dent-abolition-feminism-now-interview/">Harper&#8217;s Bazaar</a> and <a href="https://jezebel.com/perhaps-its-time-to-think-beyond-the-violence-against-w-1848450522">Jezebel</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>Davis, UCSC professor emerita of history of consciousness and feminist studies, is a widely respected activist, writer, and lecturer whose work has long focused on prisons, police, abolition, and the related intersections of race, gender, and class.&#160;</p>
<p>Dent, associate professor of feminist studies, history of consciousness, and legal studies, editor of <em>Black Popular Culture</em>, and a prison abolition activist for more than 25 years, developed UCSC&#8217;s groundbreaking public scholarship initiative, <em><a href="https://ias.ucsc.edu/content/2021/visualizing-abolition">Visualizing Abolition</a></em>, together with Rachel Nelson, director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences. The four-year program of art exhibitions, public events, postdoctoral fellowships, a faculty working group, and curriculum development aims to shift the social attachment to prisons through art and education.&#160;</p>
<p>"I&#8217;ve always been interested in the role visuality plays in sustaining our understanding of our social and political worlds, and in particular the stability of the prison in our landscape,&#8221; says Dent. &#8220;In academia, we often assume this understanding is driven by the research enterprise, but it is driven just as much by our popular and visual culture. Art is an essential arena for addressing challenges and moving us forward. It provides another realm for the generation of ideas&#8212;not merely a reflection of that which we already know, or even discover.&#8221;<img alt="" height="426" src="images/book-400px.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 7px;" width="300"/></p>
<p><em>Visualizing Abolition</em> is the largest program of its kind in the country. It has included such critically-acclaimed projects as <em>Solitary Garden</em>, an ongoing participatory public sculpture and garden project by award-winning artist jackie sumell in collaboration with Tim Young, who is currently on death row in San Quentin State Prison, and <em>Barring Freedom</em>, a group exhibition of work by contemporary artists including Hank Willis Thomas and Sadie Barnette. Originally on view at San Jos&#233; Museum of Art and now traveling to New York, the exhibition challenges the dominant ways people see and understand the complex nexus of policing, surveillance, detention, and imprisonment that makes up the nation&#8217;s prison industrial complex. Online events, a curated series of original music videos, abolition and art education materials, and information about exhibitions can be accessed <a href="https://ias.ucsc.edu/content/2021/visualizing-abolition">online</a>.&#160;</p>
<p><em>Abolition. Feminism. Now.&#8217;s</em> other authors are Erica R.

Its widespread use in products that get wet poses no danger because aluminum instantly reacts with air to acquire a coating of aluminum oxide, which blocks further reactions.</p>
<p>For years, researchers have tried to find efficient and cost-effective ways to use aluminum&#8217;s reactivity to generate clean hydrogen fuel. A new study by researchers at UC Santa Cruz shows that an easily produced composite of gallium and aluminum creates aluminum nanoparticles that react rapidly with water at room temperature to yield large amounts of hydrogen. The gallium was easily recovered for reuse after the reaction, which yields 90% of the hydrogen that could theoretically be produced from reaction of all the aluminum in the composite.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need any energy input, and it bubbles hydrogen like crazy. I&#8217;ve never seen anything like it,&#8221; said UCSC Chemistry Professor Scott Oliver.</p>
<p>Oliver and Bakthan Singaram, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, are corresponding authors of a paper on the new findings, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsanm.1c04331">published February 14 in <em>Applied Nano Materials</em></a>.</p>
<p>The reaction of aluminum and gallium with water has been known since the 1970s, and videos of it are easy to find online. It works because gallium, a liquid at just above room temperature, removes the passive aluminum oxide coating, allowing direct contact of aluminum with water. The new study, however, includes several innovations and novel findings that could lead to practical applications.</p>
<p>A U.S. patent application is pending on this technology. The international (PCT) filing on which it was based is <a href="https://kto.ucop.edu/NCD/NCD/NCD.aspx?id=32779">linked here</a>.</p>
<p>Singaram said the study grew out of a conversation he had with a student, coauthor Isai Lopez, who had seen some videos and started experimenting with aluminum-gallium hydrogen generation in his home kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t doing it in a scientific way, so I set him up with a graduate student to do a systematic study. I thought it would make a good senior thesis for him to measure the hydrogen output from different ratios of gallium and aluminum,&#8221; Singaram said.</p>
<p>Previous studies had mostly used aluminum-rich mixtures of aluminum and gallium, or in some cases more complex alloys. But Singaram&#8217;s lab found that hydrogen production increased with a gallium-rich composite. In fact, the rate of hydrogen production was so unexpectedly high the researchers thought there must be something fundamentally different about this gallium-rich alloy.</p>
<p>Oliver suggested that the formation of aluminum nanoparticles could account for the increased hydrogen production, and his lab had the equipment needed for nanoscale characterization of the alloy. Using scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction, the researchers showed the formation of aluminum nanoparticles in a 3:1 gallium-aluminum composite, which they found to be the optimal ratio for hydrogen production.</p>
<p>In this gallium-rich composite, the gallium serves both to dissolve the aluminum oxide coating and to separate the aluminum into nanoparticles. &#8220;The gallium separates the nanoparticles and keeps them from aggregating into larger particles,&#8221; Singaram said. &#8220;People have struggled to make aluminum nanoparticles, and here we are producing them under normal atmospheric pressure and room temperature conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making the composite required nothing more than simple manual mixing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our method uses a small amount of aluminum, which ensures it all dissolves into the majority gallium as discrete nanoparticles,&#8221; Oliver said. &#8220;This generates a much larger amount of hydrogen, almost complete compared to the theoretical value based on the amount of aluminum. It also makes gallium recovery easier for reuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The composite can be made with readily available sources of aluminum, including used foil or cans, and the composite can be stored for long periods by covering it with cyclohexane to protect it from moisture.</p>
<p>Although gallium is not abundant and is relatively expensive, it can be recovered and reused multiple times without losing effectiveness, Singaram said. It remains to be seen, however, if this process can be scaled up to be practical for commercial hydrogen production.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz surpassed all previous records during its participation in the annual Second Harvest Holiday Food &amp; Fund Drive, raising the equivalent of 376,099 meals.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year the campus collects food and financial contributions for</span><a href="https://www.thefoodbank.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Second Harvest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Founded in 1972, it was the first food bank in California and is the second oldest in the nation. </span>UCSC&#8217;s Staff Advisory Board runs the campus food drive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus&#8217;s outstanding performance earned it the President&#8217;s Cup award, presented annually to the public institution that raises the most meals during the annual food drive. The County of Santa Cruz and Dominican Hospital have traded off winning the cup for much of the past 20 years. Both organizations are key contributors to the drive. UCSC will be honored at an awards dinner on March 3.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive, co-chair of this year&#8217;s countywide Second Harvest holiday drive, said she was grateful for this year&#8217;s strong campus participation but not surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz fosters a culture of giving,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;It&#8217;s part of our identity. The campus and our affiliates have a deep sense of responsibility and community. We recognize that there is so much need in our community and that Second Harvest has a tremendous impact fighting hunger locally. I am thankful to everyone who helped make this year&#8217;s drive an unprecedented success.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus holiday food drive coordinator Nathan McCall, chair of UCSC&#8217;s Staff Advisory Board and manager of HR Business Information Services, called this &#8220;a momentous year" for the drive, and a fitting tribute to Second Harvest, which is now celebrating its 50th year of feeding those in need.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second Harvest named McCall as one of its three Coordinators of the Year, describing him as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">engaged, enthusiastic, and with an attention to detail that made UCSC&#8217;s food drive a great success.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked to explain why UCSC did so well in the food drive this year, McCall mentioned a generous donation that put the campus over the top. Last year, UCSC raised about $39,000 in its holiday food drive. This year, UC Santa Cruz again raised an initial total of $39,090.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But then, the Kliger family came in and gave a $35,000 gift and then another $20,000 gift on top of that,&#8217;&#8217; McCall said. &#8220;It was just incredible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCall was referring to former Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger, who retired in 2010, and his wife Rachel Kliger.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everything was almost the same and then there was this massively generous gift,&#8221; McCall said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This total&#8212;nearly $100,000, with the two gifts&#8212;translates to 376,099 meals for the drive that began just after Thanksgiving and extended into January this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCall said that he would love to see other donors &#8220;pick up the torch&#8221; next year and give in response to the Kligers' gift.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s such a great opportunity for people to realize that they can have an oversized impact with their gifts,&#8221; McCall said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The amount of food that has been distributed by Second Harvest has more than doubled since the pandemic because more people are economically vulnerable,&#8221; McCall said. &#8220;Think of the impact of the past two years on restaurants, to frontline businesses, to brick-and-mortar stores. Think of all those workers who were vulnerable before, who were maybe going to Second Harvest once a week to get some supplements of healthy food, fresh vegetables, and now they&#8217;re going there every day.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For David and Rachel Kliger, the donation to the food drive was deeply personal, and part of their life philosophy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When Rachel and I did this, we had no intention to be public about it, but if this helps convince others to make contributions to activities they support that would be an extra benefit,&#8221; David Kliger said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Judaism there is a concept called tikkun olam, which translates to &#8216;repair the world,'&#8221; Kliger said. "We wanted to use our resources in a way to do this in our local community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kligers support other causes, including Women in Science and Engineering (WISE), the Seymour Center&#8217;s program introducing girls to marine science, and Santa Cruz Hillel.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, said Kliger, &#8220;The largest component of our giving this year was to support Second Harvest Food Bank since we felt that food insecurity is particularly problematic these days. Before we can solve other problems, we must solve this pressing issue first.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second Harvest Food Bank is known for its efficiency and its ability to stretch every dollar it receives, McCall said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Second Harvest has built strong and long-standing relationships with food producers, it can buy produce for pennies on the dollar, enabling the organization to feed a family of four for one dollar.&#160; A donation of $1,100 feeds a family of four for a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>This coming year, UCSC is rolling out a new theme for its fundraiser: <em>"</em></span><em>Give what you get.</em><span><em>"</em> This&#160;challenges each donor to give enough money to feed someone else for the whole year. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>"Since the Second Harvest Food Bank can buy four healthy meals for $1, and there is 10 months until the height of the next food drive, one community member can feed one other person for a whole year by setting aside $28 per month for the next 10 months," McCall said. "If you get to eat, give that gift to someone else, and g</span>ive&#160;what you get."</span></p>

As the meltwater descends, gravitational energy is converted into heat in a process that was predicted to occur in a theoretical paper published five years ago by UC Santa Cruz scientists.</p>
<p>In the new study, an international team of scientists led by the University of Cambridge found that the effect of meltwater descending from the surface of the ice sheet down to the bed&#8212;a kilometer or more below&#8212;is by far the largest heat source beneath the world&#8217;s second-largest ice sheet, leading to phenomenally high rates of melting at its base. They reported their findings in a paper<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/119/10/e2116036119"> published February 21 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>.</p>
<p>The new findings support earlier calculations (<a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/11/303/2017/">published in <em>Cryosphere</em> in 2017</a>) by Slawek Tulaczyk, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, and Kenneth Mankoff, then a UCSC graduate student and now at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. Both are coauthors of the new study.</p>
<p>&#8220;We made theoretical calculations based on other people&#8217;s estimates of the amount of meltwater on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet and its elevation, roughly half a mile to a mile above sea level, which we realized represents a lot of gravitational energy,&#8221; Tulaczyk said.</p>
<p>The gravitational energy of meltwater forming at the surface is converted to heat as the water flows through large cracks in the ice down to the base of the ice sheet. The lubricating effect of basal meltwater has a strong effect on the movement of glaciers and the quantity of ice discharged into the ocean, but directly measuring conditions beneath a kilometer of ice is a challenge, especially in Greenland where glaciers are among the world&#8217;s fastest moving.</p>
<p>This lack of direct measurements makes it difficult to understand the dynamic behavior of the Greenland Ice Sheet and predict future changes. With ice losses tied to both melting and discharge, the Greenland Ice Sheet is now the largest single contributor to global sea level rise.</p>
<p>Each summer, thousands of meltwater lakes and streams form on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet as temperatures rise and daily sunlight increases. Many of these lakes quickly drain to the bottom of the ice sheet, falling through cracks and large fractures in the ice. With a continued supply of water from streams and rivers, connections between surface and bed often remain open.</p>
<p>As part of the EU-funded <a href="https://www.erc-responder.eu/">RESPONDER project</a>, corresponding author Poul Christoffersen from Cambridge&#8217;s Scott Polar Research Institute has been studying these meltwater lakes, how and why they drain so quickly, and the effect that they have on the overall behavior of the ice sheet as global temperatures continue to rise.</p>
<p>The current work is the culmination of a study that spans seven years and focuses on Store Glacier, one of the largest outlets from the Greenland Ice Sheet.</p>
<p>&#8220;When studying basal melting of ice sheets and glaciers, we look at sources of heat like friction, geothermal energy, latent heat released where water freezes, and heat losses into the ice above,&#8221; said Christoffersen. &#8220;But what we hadn&#8217;t really looked at was the heat generated by the draining meltwater itself. There&#8217;s an awful lot of gravitational energy stored in the water that forms on the surface and when it falls, the energy has to go somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>To measure basal melt rates, the researchers used phase-sensitive radio-echo sounding, a technique developed at the British Antarctic Survey and used previously on floating ice sheets in Antarctica.</p>
<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t sure that the technique would also work on a fast-flowing glacier in Greenland,&#8221; said first author Tun Jan Young, who installed the radar system on Store Glacier as part of his Ph.D. at Cambridge. &#8220;Compared to Antarctica, the ice deforms really fast and there is a lot of meltwater in summer, which sometimes complicates the work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The basal melt rates observed with radar were often as high as the melt rates measured on the surface with a weather station, a stunning observation considering that the surface receives energy from the sun while the base does not. To explain the results, the Cambridge researchers teamed up with Tulaczyk and Mankoff. (Christoffersen had done postdoctoral research with Tulaczyk at UCSC in 2003-04.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Poul of course was familiar with our paper and concluded that they were seeing the effect of what we had theorized,&#8221; Tulaczyk said. &#8220;The new paper includes a regional version of the calculations we had done earlier for the whole ice sheet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team calculated that as much as 82 million cubic meters of meltwater was transferred to the bed of Store Glacier every day during the summer of 2014. They estimate that the power produced by the falling water during peak melt periods was comparable to the power produced by the Three Gorges Dam in China, the world&#8217;s largest hydroelectric power station. With a melt area that expands to nearly a million square kilometers in total during peak melt, the Greenland Ice Sheet produces more hydropower than the world&#8217;s ten largest hydroelectric power stations combined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given what we are witnessing at the high latitudes in terms of climate change, this rate could easily double or triple, and we&#8217;re still not even including these numbers when we estimate the ice sheet&#8217;s contribution to sea level rise,&#8221; said Christoffersen.</p>
<p>To verify the high basal melt rates recorded by the radar system, the team integrated independent temperature measurements from sensors installed in a nearby borehole. At the base, they found the temperature of water to be as high as +0.88 degrees Celsius, which is unexpectedly warm for an ice sheet base with a melting point of -0.40 degrees.</p>
<p>&#8220;The borehole observations confirmed that the meltwater heats up when it hits the bed,&#8221; said Christoffersen. &#8220;The reason is that the basal drainage system is a lot less efficient than the fractures and conduits that bring the water through the ice. The reduced drainage efficiency causes frictional heating within the water itself. When we took this heat source out of our calculations, the theoretical melt rate estimates were a full two orders of magnitude out. The heat generated by the falling water is melting the ice from the bottom up, and the melt rate we are reporting is completely unprecedented.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study presents the first concrete evidence of an ice-sheet mass-loss mechanism not yet included in projections of global sea level rise. While the high melt rates are specific to heat produced in subglacial drainage paths carrying surface water, the volume of surface water produced in Greenland is huge and growing, and nearly all of it drains to the bed.</p>

The project has undergone recent changes, including the near-doubling of the number of student beds.</p>
<p>The Kresge Renewal is the name that was given to the massive rehabilitation and updating of the historic college, known for its post-modernist architecture and strong emphasis on social justice.</p>
<p><u></u>Kresge&#8217;s new residential halls are set to open next winter, while a new 35,000-square-foot academic center and plaza, set to be finished at the end of January 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>This Kresge Academic Center will have classrooms serving the entire campus, including a 600-seat lecture hall, which would become the largest of its kind on campus; a 150-seat lecture hall; and 50- and 35-seat classrooms. A 48-seat computing lab is also included.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>The project in its entirety&#8212;including the second phase of construction that will begin at the south end of Kresge this fall&#8212;will be finished in 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>When the UC Regents approved the renewal project in March 2019, the Kresge Renewal project had about 550 beds counting both new construction and existing residential buildings. But project planners have nearly doubled that amount, increasing it to approximately 970, said Jolie Kerns, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Director of Physical and Environmental Planning. This results in a total net of 605 new beds.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>Aside from maximizing the capacity of existing apartments, Kresge will add new residential halls that include 400 beds intended for first-year students. (The 400 beds are not all net new beds&#8212;they&#8217;re replacing some of the existing 365 beds.) The project team also relocated some administrative offices to Quarry Plaza to make room for the additional housing at Kresge.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>&#8220;We were able to increase the number of beds within the existing building volume,&#8221; Kerns said. &#8220;We&#8217;re adding a third floor to a number of existing residential buildings in Kresge college by tucking it into the existing double-height space, including one building that was slated for removal; we&#8217;re now able to keep it with the increased budget, to help address the crucial need for housing. This is fulfilling two goals at once:&#160; rehabilitating the historic architecture of the college in keeping with the original, while increasing capacity to help help with the housing crunch.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>Kerns credited Chancellor Cynthia Larive for making student housing a strong priority in the Kresge project.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>&#8220;The project has the capacity to add those beds&#8212;it was just a question of budget&#8212;and she&#8217;s been terrific," Kerns said.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>Larive praised the architects and project planners for finding ways to increase student housing, noting the critical need.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>&#8220;We already house more than half of our students &#8212; more than any UC campus &#8212; but more housing is needed,&#8221; she said. &#8220; The high rental prices and low availability of off-campus apartments make finding housing challenging for our students. It is great that our project planners have found ways to increase the number of spaces for students without expanding the footprint of the original project.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>Larive also called attention to the ways in which the project has preserved the vitality of the original Kresge College design, which was done by famed postmodernist architects Charles Moore and William Turnbull of Moore Lyndon Turnbull Whitaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>&#8220;Next year is the 50th anniversary of Kresge College," she said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of a better way to honor the legacy of Kresge than a renewal project that preserves Kresge&#8217;s sense of community, while making the campus more welcoming and accessible to all students.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>Kerns has been working closely with Studio Gang Architects, the architectural firm of Jeanne Gang, noted architect and MacArthur Fellow whose firm is based in Chicago with offices in New York and San Francisco. They have teamed up with TEF Architects who are&#160; responsible for the renovated buildings. Gang is recognized as one of the most prominent architects of her generation. She believes that architecture should be a vehicle for positive social and environmental impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>&#8220;There are a lot of challenges and opportunities in this kind of project because of the historically significant architecture,&#8221; Kerns said. &#8220;But by addressing the issues creatively, we can simultaneously re-establish its integrity and update the project to the needs of the 21st century while focusing on what is important for the campus.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>Kerns also pointed out the improved wayfinding and circulation through the project, as well as its increased connectivity to the rest of campus, &#8220;and a greater sense of arrival," with better signage.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>&#8220;We also want to create expanded areas for gathering, instill a strong sense of community for the residential college, and make sure pedestrians can walk freely throughout the project,&#8221; Kerns said.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>The new construction is energy- and resource-efficient, with a system of "dual plumbing" that brings non-potable reclaimed stormwater for toilet flushing and irrigation needs, as well as potable water.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>&#8220;It&#8217;s a really important feature in our drought climate,&#8221; Kerns said. &#8220;And the project is all-electric, which will contribute to the campus&#8217; carbon neutrality goals," she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>Large portions of the iconic Kresge architecture will be reconstructed to retain their same shape, look, and color, but with more durable and resilient materials.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>Other features will include: a new cafe, which will be built close to the front of the Academic Plaza, and a pedestrian trail that will weave in and out of the cluster of three new residential halls.</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"></a>Because of the necessary budget increase to fund the new beds, the Kresge team will go before the UC Regents for another round of approvals this spring.</p>

(Photo by Dan Costa)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Researchers found that female elephant seals know their distance from the breeding beach and allocate extra time to get back if they have farther to travel</article-subhead><article-text><p>Each year, pregnant female elephant seals take an approximately 240-day trek over 10,000 kilometers across the Eastern North Pacific Ocean before returning to their breeding beaches to give birth within five days of their arrival. Now, a study led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz finds that this impressive navigation ability depends on an internal map sense, which functions much like a built-in GPS.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that migrating elephant seals know how far they are from their breeding beach thousands of kilometers away,&#8221; said Roxanne Beltran, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;They also know approximately how long it will take them to get back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beltran and her colleagues&#8212;including Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences&#8212;knew that elephant seals are expert navigators. What they didn&#8217;t know was how the seals manage to make it back to the beach just in time for the breeding season.</p>
<p>In the new study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.01.031">published February 28 in <em>Current Biology</em></a><em>,</em> the researchers used satellite tracking data collected from more than 100 adult female seals. They figured out when each of them turned around to head back to the beach they started from.</p>
<p>The data revealed that seals decided to turn around based strongly on how far away they were from where they needed to go. Their decisions to turn around weren&#8217;t related to their body condition, measured as amount of body fat.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were surprised that foraging success or percent body fat was not more strongly related to when seals begin the return portion of the migration,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;We expected that highly successful (i.e. fatter) seals might end their foraging trips earlier, but that was not the case; instead, it seems like they are well programmed to turn around strategically based on where they are and in turn how long it will take them to get back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers don&#8217;t yet know what sensory cues the elephant seals depend on to keep track of where they are and head in the right direction at the right time, but it&#8217;s clear that they can adjust the timing of their travels based on an internal perception of time and space.</p>
<p>The results help to better understand elephant seals, with important implications for their conservation, the researchers say. In future studies, they hope to quantify exactly how precise the seals&#8217; navigation ability is and determine which cues are most important.</p>
<p>In addition to Beltran and Costa, the coauthors include Alexander Yuen, Richard Condit, and Patrick Robinson at UC Santa Cruz, Max Czapanskiy at Hopkins Marine Station, and Daniel Crocker at Sonoma State University. The work was funded by the Office of Naval Research, the E&amp;P Sound and Marine Life Joint Industry Project of the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, and the National Science Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2cceddcd8072704664be42b475eedd00"><name>opera-mainstage-theater-march</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Family-friendly opera returns to Mainstage Theater this March with My Head is Full of Colors</title><summary>On March 12, Family Opera returns live to the Mainstage Theater with My Head is Full of Colors, a joyful tale of imagination composed by UCSC Lecturer Chris Pratorius Gómez, with a libretto by Nicole Paiement, and directed by Lecturer Sheila Willey.&#13;

This March 12, Family Opera returns live to the Mainstage Theater for two back-to-back matinees of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Head is Full of Colors</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a joyful tale of imagination composed by UCSC Lecturer Chris Pratorius G&#243;mez, with a libretto by Nicole Paiement, and directed by Lecturer Sheila Willey, who heads up UCSC&#8217;s unique opera program, one of the very few in the United States to feature almost entirely undergraduate casts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the popular book by Catherine Friend, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Head is Full of Colors </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tells the story of a young girl named Maria, who wakes up one morning to find her hair has turned into all the colors of the rainbow. With a &#8216;head full of colors,&#8217; she draws and paints like never before. Each day, she arises with something new and unexpected in her head, leading to great imaginary adventures, enacted by a lively chorus of eleven singers, that she shares with her loving father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Pratorius G&#243;mez, who had not composed operas for children before he was commissioned by Opera Paral</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">l&#232;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">le to create </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Head is Full of Colors</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and two others for its school program, Maria&#8217;s flights of imaginative fancy presented an intriguing opportunity to experiment. &#8220;Thinking about how to use the emotional, acoustic language of music to illustrate what&#8217;s in a child&#8217;s mind was fun,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There is a level of playfulness baked into childrens&#8217; productions that is great and gives a classical composer a much bigger range to work with. We tend to be so serious when making work for adults, but it requires the same level of craft, if not more, to make something funny. Honestly, it made me a much better composer.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Family Opera also makes the members of the University Opera Theater better performers according to Willey. &#8220;You can definitely tell when the audience is not with you,&#8221; she laughs. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a&#160; great exercise in how to hold people&#8217;s attention. We don&#8217;t ask that the children be quiet, so you just know immediately when you&#8217;ve lost them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willey also notes that the annual Family Opera is a chance for UCSC students to get valuable production experience in everything from costumes to hair and make-up. &#8220;What I want students to know after this is that if you were ever in the position of putting together a small opera or any kind of show, you could do it,&#8221; she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally as important for both faculty members is the opportunity for the local community and its youngest members to experience opera. &#8220;Opera is a pretty special art form,&#8221; says Willey. &#8220;It combines so much&#8212;acoustic music, live musicians, costumes, sets, acting, and those very loud voices. I remember being so struck by the volume when I was a kid! It really left an impression.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pratorius G&#243;mez adds, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have regular opera here in the Santa Cruz area, so for it to even get on a child&#8217;s radar, for it to be an option down the road as a listener or performer, that&#8217;s so valuable.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I couldn&#8217;t be more impressed with the quality of the applicant pool and the broad diversity represented. The resilience and perseverance demonstrated by both students applying from high school and those transferring from another college is so commendable," said Associate Vice Chancellor for Enrollment Management Michelle Whittingham. "We also recognize and appreciate all the support provided by family, teachers and counselors who guided them as they navigated a very different educational journey."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A leader at the intersection of innovation and social justice, UC Santa Cruz continues to attract a high quality and diverse group of applicants, comprised of candidates who are ready to join a community of students, faculty, and staff who are using their voices to create real change. \</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus continues on an incredible trajectory with faculty conducting transformative research and creative scholarship that serves the world. Affirming UC Santa Cruz's reputation of pushing for positive change, the campus last year was named the No. 3 public university in the nation for students focused on making an impact on the world in the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/princeton-review.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princeton Review&#8217;s college rankings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz joined the Association of American Universities (AAU) in 2019 and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities in 2020, underscoring the impact and quality of the campus&#8217; research as well as graduate and undergraduate teaching. UC Santa Cruz shares the distinction of being the youngest member of the esteemed 66-member AAU and is one of only two members that is also a Hispanic-serving and Asian American, Native American, Pacific Islander-serving institution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At UC Santa Cruz, the pairing of high-impact research with 10 vibrant and interdisciplinary residential colleges offers undergraduate students the experience of a small liberal arts college with the depth and rigor of a major research university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The competition to earn a spot at UC Santa Cruz remains strong this year, with a record number of applications received. The campus is committed to carefully managing its total enrollment while additional student housing is built.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus received more than 77,500 applications from first-year students and transfer students, a 3.5 percent increase over the previous year, according to preliminary data released today by the UC Office of the President.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus received more than 53,000 applications from California high school students, a 7.8 percent increase over the previous year, and more than 10,500 applications from California students studying primarily at California community colleges, a 10 percent decrease, which is reflective of the enrollment changes in the community colleges and in line with application changes across the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz received more than 24,000 applications from California students with families with low incomes, many of whom will also be the first in their families to earn a four-year degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications from first-year and transfer students outside of California continued to see fluctuations with increased applications from domestic students and fewer applications from international students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz continued to see interest from ethnically diverse California students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of California first-year applicants, 5 percent identify as African American; 34 percent as Asian American; 33 percent as Chicanx/Latinx; 1 percent as American Indian and 25 percent as white. Of the California community college applicants who are domestic students, 6 percent identify as African American; 28 percent as Asian American; 31 percent as Chicanx/Latinx; 1 percent as American Indian; and 32 percent as White.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vibrant mix of California, international, and out-of-state first-year and transfer students enhances the campus community through their varied experiences and perspectives. This cohort of future alumni, the Class of 2024 and the Class of 2026, will join more than 140,000 alumni who are making their own contributions locally, regionally, and globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus received more than 4,700 graduate applications, of which 2,400 were from international students. Of the graduate applicants, 2 percent identify as African American; 11 percent as Asian American; 8 percent as Chicanx/Latinx and 24 percent as white. Some graduate programs are continuing to accept applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First-year undergraduate applicants will be notified of admission decisions by mid-March. Transfer decisions will begin to be released in mid-March.

<p>Beaulieu&#8217;s research program is motivated by the need to understand the drivers of variability and change in the ocean and climate, and it addresses the challenge of harnessing increasingly complex environmental data. The NSF CAREER Award will support an integrated research and education program focused on the observed and future rate of climate change, which has implications for societies and the environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;This project represents the culmination of several years of research, mentoring, training, and teaching in the emerging field of environmental data science, integrating my work on climate and environmental change with my expertise in statistics to synergistically advance research and education,&#8221; Beaulieu said. &#8220;My overarching goal is to gain a better understanding of climate variability and change through a data science approach, and I am devoted to the training of the next generation of environmental scientists with skills to analyze the rapidly growing store of environmental data to meet this aim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recent advances in climate and ocean monitoring, observational platforms, measurement techniques, and Earth system models have contributed to a rapid increase in the quality and quantity of available data. Beaulieu&#8217;s efforts are based on a range of interdisciplinary approaches that implement statistical and machine learning techniques to make the best use of both observational data and outputs from model simulations.</p>
<p>In climate research, the rate of warming has been given less attention than the amount of warming, but both are important to monitor. While some economic sectors, ecosystems, and species are directly affected by the actual temperature, others are sensitive to the pace of change as they need time to adapt, migrate, or otherwise reach a new sustainable state.</p>
<p>The rate of climate change is not uniform in space or time. Beaulieu said she expects there are coherent systems of changes in the warming rate that can be detected in historical data and tied to specific combinations of natural and anthropogenic drivers. &#8220;These systems are likely increasing in frequency, extent, and magnitude as we advance into and through this century,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Beaulieu&#8217;s project will focus on detecting coherent systems of warming rate changes, understanding the drivers of these systems of change, and projecting their future evolution in frequency and extent through the end of this century.</p>
<p>In concert with this research, she plans to develop related resources for students, managers, policy-makers, and the wider public. The goal is to help fill the current gap in data science training in environmental sciences curricula and broaden participation in STEM.</p>
<p>Her team will also develop a user-friendly dashboard to visualize and monitor the pace of temperature change for different parts of the world, and to identify regions with accelerated rates of warming as quickly as possible. The dashboard will specifically monitor temperature change on Indigenous ancestral lands. Beaulieu said she is particularly excited that the NSF CAREER award will enable her to focus on Indigenous territories, as a resource to traditional stewards of the land, and by the opportunity to integrate these new findings into climate change research, outreach, and education.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monitoring the pace of climate change is crucial for communities at risk to communicate impacts and make timely and informed decisions,&#8221; Beaulieu said.</p>
<p>Beaulieu earned a Ph.D. in water sciences at the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique Centre Eau Terre et Environnement in Quebec, followed by postdoctoral research in atmospheric and oceanic sciences at Princeton University. She was a lecturer in the School of Ocean and Earth Science at University of Southampton prior to joining the UCSC faculty in 2018.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="325e2ca38072704664be42b480c89da2"><name>ssrc-membership</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz joins Social Science Research Council</title><summary>The campus is now a member of the Social Science Research Council's College and University Fund for the Social Sciences, which will offer new opportunities for UC Santa Cruz to help shape research priorities across the field.&#13;

This affiliation places UC Santa Cruz as a national and international leader in social sciences and will offer new opportunities for the campus to help shape research priorities across the field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SSRC is an international organization with a nearly 100-year history of coordinating research, policy, and philanthropy efforts to advance the social sciences. The </span><a href="https://www.ssrc.org/programs/college-and-university-fund-for-the-social-sciences"><span style="font-weight: 400;">College and University Fund for the Social Sciences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was established in 2013 to connect top research institutions with public and private funders in order to identify strategic funding priorities. UC Santa Cruz is now among 39 higher education institutions that serve as members of this group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some of our research strengths as a campus that we bring to the table include community-engaged research and public scholarship and our insistence on social justice in everything that we do,&#8221; said Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell. &#8220;We believe the social sciences are integral to examining every major issue in our society; this membership positions us to help ensure that research funding will reflect these priorities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean Mitchell worked with social sciences deans at UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara to help establish a new UC consortium of seven campuses, and the resulting reduction in membership fees for each campus made it possible for UC Santa Cruz&#8212;and also UC Riverside and UCLA&#8212;to join the prestigious SSRC community. Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor (CP/EVC) Lori Kletzer and Interim Vice Chancellor of Research John MacMillan were important partners in this endeavor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SSRC affiliation adds to UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s growing list of distinctions for research leadership, which includes membership in the Association of American Universities, recognition as an R1 Hispanic-Serving Institution and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution, and strong faculty representation in organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our faculty and students at UC Santa Cruz are engaged in ground-breaking and highly influential research across a wide variety of disciplines, and this newest membership affirms our long history of leadership in the social sciences,&#8221; said CP/EVC Lori Kletzer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming months, the Division of Social Sciences&#8217; </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Social Transformation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will work to share additional information with faculty and students about new opportunities that the university&#8217;s official affiliation with the SSRC may provide. Current SSRC research </span><a href="https://www.ssrc.org/our-work/#ssrc-themes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">focus areas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include emergent technologies and democracy, health and society, inequality and inclusion, and global scholarship and collaboration.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding opportunities typically encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and often connect the social sciences with the humanities, arts, or sciences. Chris Benner, the director of the Institute for Social Transformation and a professor of sociology and environmental studies, says the added support for these types of partnerships is a particularly exciting aspect of the new SSRC affiliation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The SSRC is very explicitly interdisciplinary in what they fund, and it&#8217;s also a really important venue for cross-institutional connection among universities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This builds networks and brings scholars together in a way that strengthens their work and that helps to push the boundaries of thought and research on crucial social issues.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="32fb62668072704664be42b4915af5bc"><name>covid-sick-leave</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL22) for COVID-19 relief available to all employees in 2022</title><summary>This communication is to inform you of a recent update on the University of California’s (University) COVID-19 Related Leaves for policy-covered and represented academic and staff employees.</summary><start-date>1645689600000</start-date><display-name>New Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL22) for COVID-19 relief available to all employees in 2022</display-name><path>/2022/02/covid-sick-leave</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/02/covid-sick-leave</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1645827809867</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1645827809867</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>This communication is to inform you of a recent update on the University of California&#8217;s (University) COVID-19 Related Leaves for policy-covered and represented academic and staff employees.</span></p>

It&#8217;s the 800-mile-long monster that cleaves California from south to north, as two tectonic plates slowly grind against each other, threatening to produce big earthquakes.</p>
<p>Lesser known is the fact that the San Andreas comprises three major sections that can move independently. In all three, the plates are trying to move past each other in opposing directions, like two hands rubbing against each other. But in the southern and the northern sections, the plates are locked much of the time&#8212;stuck together in an immobile, poisonous embrace. This causes stresses to build over years, decades or centuries. Then a breaking point comes; the two sides lurch past each other violently, and there is an earthquake. On the other hand, in the central section, which separates the other two, the plates slip past each other at a pleasant, steady 26 millimeters or so each year. This prevents stresses from building, and thus there are no big quakes. This is called aseismic creep.</p>
<p>At least that is the story most scientists are sticking with so far. Now, a study of rocks drilled from nearly 2 miles under the surface suggests that the central section has hosted many major earthquakes, including some that could have been fairly recent. The study, <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/doi/10.1130/G49451.1/612167/History-of-earthquakes-along-the-creeping-section">published February 25 in <em>Geology</em></a>, uses new chemical-analysis methods to gauge the heating of rocks during prehistoric quakes.</p>
<p>&#8220;This means we can get larger earthquakes on the central section than we thought,&#8221; said lead author Genevieve Coffey, who did the research as a graduate student at Columbia University&#8217;s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. &#8220;We should be aware that there is this potential, that it is not always just continuous creep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coauthors Pratigya Polissar and Heather Savage, now at UC Santa Cruz, developed a new technique that enabled the team to assess the history of earthquake slip on the fault.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the goals of this work is to address the problem that the largest, most dangerous earthquakes are often rare and therefore either sparse or absent from the historical records used to estimate earthquake hazard for engineering and social planning,&#8221; said Savage, an associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC. &#8220;Paleoseismic records using techniques such as carbon dating can push us back tens of thousands of years, but are only preserved in certain settings. Our solution is to use geochemical proxies to identify rocks that have experienced significant earthquake heating in the past, and to estimate the degree of heating.&#8221;</p>
<p>The threats of the San Andreas are legion. The northern section hosted the catastrophic 1906 San Francisco magnitude 7.9 earthquake, which killed 3,000 people and leveled much of the city. Also, the 1989 M6.9 Loma Prieta quake, which killed more than 60 and collapsed a major elevated freeway. The southern section caused the 1994 M6.7 Northridge earthquake near Los Angeles, also killing about 60 people. Many scientists believe it is building energy for a 1906-scale event.</p>
<p>The central section, by contrast, appears harmless. Only one small area, near its southern terminus, is known to produce any real quakes. There, magnitude 6 events&#8212;not that dangerous by most standards&#8212;occur about every 20 years. Because of their regularity, scientists hoping to study clues that might signal a coming quake have set up a major observatory atop the fault near the city of Parkfield. It features a 3.2-kilometer-deep borehole from which rock cores have been retrieved, and monitoring instruments above and below ground. It was rock from near the bottom of the borehole that Coffey and her colleagues analyzed.</p>
<p>When earthquake faults slip, friction along the moving parts can cause temperatures to spike hundreds of degrees above those of surrounding rocks. This cooks the rocks, altering the makeup of organic compounds in any sedimentary formations along the fault path.</p>
<p>Polissar and Savage figured out how to take advantage of these so-called biomarkers, using the altered compositions to map prehistoric earthquakes. By calculating the degree of heating in the rock, they say they can spot past events and estimate how far the fault moved, and from this, extrapolate roughly the sizes of resulting earthquakes.</p>
<p>In the new study, the researchers found many such altered compositions in a band of highly disturbed sedimentary rock lying between 3192 and 3196 meters below the surface. In all, they say the blackish, crumbly stuff shows signs of more than 100 quakes. In most, the fault appears to have jumped more than 1.5 meters (5 feet). This would translate to at least a magnitude 6.9 quake, the size of the destructive Loma Prieta and Northridge events. But many could well have been larger, say the researchers, because their method of estimating earthquake magnitude is still evolving. Earthquakes along the central section may have been similar in size to other large earthquakes on the San Andreas, such as the one that destroyed San Francisco.</p>
<p>The current official California earthquake hazard model, used to set building codes and insurance rates, does include the remote possibility of a big central-section rupture. But inclusion of this possibility, arrived at through mathematical calculations, was controversial, given the lack of evidence for any such prior event. The new study appears to be the first to indicate that such quakes have in fact occurred here. The authors say they could have originated in the central section, or perhaps more likely, started to the north or south, and migrated through the central.</p>
<p>So, when did these quakes happen? Trenches dug by paleoseismologists across the central section have revealed no disturbed soil layers that would indicate quakes rupturing the surface in the last 2,000 years&#8212;about the limit for detection using that method in this region. But 2,000 years is an eye blink in geologic terms. And, the excavations could be missing any number of quakes that might not necessarily rupture the surface at specific sites.</p>
<p>The researchers used a second new technique to address this question. The biomarkers run along very narrow bands, from microscopic to just a couple of centimeters wide. Just a few inches or feet away, the rock heats only enough to drive out some or all of the gas argon naturally present there. Conveniently for the authors, other scientists have long used the ratio of radioactive potassium to argon, into which potassium slowly decays, to measure the ages of rocks. The more argon compared to potassium, the older the rock. Thus, if some or all of the argon is driven out by quake-induced heat, the radioactive &#8220;clock&#8221; gets reset, and the rock appears younger than identical nearby rock that was not heated.</p>
<p>This is exactly what the team found. The sediments they studied were formed tens of millions of years ago in an ancient Pacific basin that was subducted under California. Yet the ages of rocks surrounding the thin quake slip zones came out looking as young as 3.2 million years by the potassium-argon clock. This sets out a time frame, but only a vague one, because the scientists still do not know how to judge the amount of argon that was driven out, and thus how thoroughly the clock may have been reset. This means that 3.2 million years is just an upper age limit for the most recent quakes, said Coffey; in fact, some could have taken place as little as a few hundred or a few thousand years ago, she said. The group is now working on a new project to refine the age interpretations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, our work points to the potential for higher magnitude earthquakes in central California and highlights the importance of including the central [San Andreas Fault] and other creeping faults in seismic hazard analysis,&#8221; the authors write.</p>
<p>William Ellsworth, a geophysicist at Stanford University who has led research at the drill site, pointed out that while the possibility of a big quake is included in the state&#8217;s official hazard assessment, &#8220;Most earthquake scientists think that they happen rarely, as tectonic strain is not accumulating at significant rates, if at all, along it at the present time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Morgan Page, a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey who coauthored the hazard assessment, said the study breaks new ground. &#8220;The creeping section is a difficult place to do paleoseismology, because evidence for earthquakes can be easily erased by the creep,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If this holds up, this is the first evidence of a big seismic rupture in this part of the fault.&#8221; She said that if a big earthquake can tear through the creeping section, it means that it is possible&#8212;though chances would be remote&#8212;that one could start at the very southern tip of the San Andreas, travel through the central section and continue all the way on up to the end of the northern section&#8212;the so-called &#8220;Big One&#8221; that people like to speculate about. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited about this new evidence, and hope we can use it to better constrain this part of our model,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>How much should this worry Californians? Lamont-Doherty geologist and study coauthor Stephen Cox plays this down. &#8220;People should not be alarmed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Building codes in California are now quite good. Seismic events are inevitable. Work like this helps us figure out what is the biggest possible event, and helps everyone prepare.&#8221;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology is often portrayed as a neutral value or a force of good, but Americans who care about social justice should consider the ways that &#8220;smart borders," hiring algorithms, and surveillance practices perpetuate racism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sociologist Ruha Benjamin made this incisive argument during her keynote remarks at the all-virtual 38th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation on Feb. 23.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The convocation celebrates King&#8217;s life and legacy, and has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attracted a wide array of speakers, including Harvard professor Cornel West; Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning author Alice Walker; Black Lives Matter cofounder Alicia Garza; and radical activist and UC Santa Cruz Professor Emerita Angela Davis, who drew one of the biggest-ever crowds to the convocation at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium in 2016. For the past two convocations, the ceremony has pivoted to an all-virtual format.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjamin often referred to the misleading &#8220;neutral&#8221; veneer of cutting-edge tech and how this popular image often disguises oppressive practices. She referred to &#8220;smart borders&#8221; technology that makes use of the latest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surveillance and monitoring technologies including drones, motion sensors, and facial recognition technologies in areas including the U.S. border with Mexico.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The power of these technologies rests on a false assertion of neutrality,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;They count on us believing they are more objective, more humanitarian even, than a scowling border agent wielding a whip.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An African American studies professor at Princeton University, Benjamin has investigated the ways in which discrimination is hardwired into modern technology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> examines the relationship between machine bias and systemic racism, analyzing specific cases of &#8220;discriminatory design&#8221; and offering tools for a socially conscious approach to tech development.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a review of the book&#8212;which was awarded Brooklyn Public Library&#8217;s 2020 Nonfiction Prize&#8212;Stephen Kearse of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nation </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">praised Benjamin for her &#8220;withering critique&#8221; of tech that sustains or worsens racism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her MLK presentation, Benjamin mentioned technology-based practices such as immigrant databases, digital IDs, and electronic tracking systems.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For all the talk of smart borders, which use biometric face verification, aerial drones, and data fusion centers, borders are just becoming more intensive sites of racialized surveillance, displacement, and death,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Smartness in this sense hearkens back to the eugenic underpinnings of both artificial and organic intelligence and its primary directive to categorize and rank humans, eradicating those deemed worthless while propagating those judged worthy,&#8221; Benjamin continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These smart technologies are also used to repress dissent, Benjamin said. She mentioned &#8220;the many different types of surveillance deployed against Black Lives Matter protesters, from police body cams, drones overhead, facial recognition software, and even online tracking technologies like ones produced by [the Wyoming-based company] Shadowdragon, that allows police to suck in your data from social media and other internet sources including Amazon and dating sites.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjamin also examined the historic roots of racism-infused tech practices.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not only did eugenics shape statistics as [mathematician] Aubrey Clayton elaborates in his powerful essay ["</span><a href="https://nautil.us/how-eugenics-shaped-statistics-9365/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Eugenics Shaped Statistics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">," </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nautilus Magazine,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> October 2020], but it was considered a progressive science by its proponents and chief architects, many of whom were propped up by the same universities who today hail artificial intelligence as the savior of all of our social ills,&#8221; Benjamin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her live exchange with Camilla Hawthorne, assistant professor of sociology and critical race and ethnic studies, she also warned that tech can use the veneer of inclusivity to hide injustice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Diversity and inclusion rhetoric can go hand in hand with maintaining the status quo,&#8221; Benjamin said during the Q&amp;A that followed her keynote address. &#8220;So you can have an all-Black-and-Latinx design group, but if their mandate is still to build tools for ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] or tools for the police, that diversity just becomes a cover for businesses as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the heartening things is that student organizers are seeing through the rhetoric,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;They're seeing through the &#8216;feel good&#8217; pipelines that are being created. There are campaigns now that are encouraging students not even to apply to certain companies if they maintain contracts with the carceral state or with ICE.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In referencing &#8220;the carceral state,&#8221; Benjamin was referring to institutions of confinement, including prisons, as well as policies and practices relating to those institutions, including the criminal justice system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am also heartened by young people who are not drinking that Kool-Aid, who are not falling for the inclusive framing when they know that they will just become cogs in this machine and be on the websites and be in the commercials,&#8221; Benjamin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is also a growing awareness that you can&#8217;t just trust these [tech] companies to work in our best interest,&#8221; Benjamin said. &#8220;When we talk about social media, we talk about being connected freely widely, globally, but it also means a whole set of things connecting to us, swallowing our data."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also praised tech workers &#8220;speaking out against corporate collusion in racism.&#8221; She mentioned Google employees who urged the company to pull out of an AI project that could be used to make drone strikes more effective.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also promoted the handbook</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Racial Literacy In Tech: Why Ethics, Diversity In Hiring and Implicit Bias Trainings Are Not Enough,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and cited organizations including the Immigrant Defense Project, which &#8216;&#8220;take a proactive approach to tech justice.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The evening also included an emotional video retrospective of the Tony Hill Award, with Hill&#8217;s widow Melanie Stern and daughter Tara Kemp highlighting honorees over the years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This special honor recognizes individuals whose lives and actions exemplify the late Tony Hill's work and legacy. Hill, a longtime advocate for social and economic justice in Santa Cruz County, was known for his skills as a community bridge-builder and mediator. He died in 2007 at age 62.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the convocation, UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive praised Hill and the honorees.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;d like to thank </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melanie Stern and Tara Kemp for their work over the past 14 years, and helping us to recognize and celebrate efforts of local change-makers and bridge builders, recognizing those in our community working for social and economic justice, for fairness, and for equity as Tony Hill did.
