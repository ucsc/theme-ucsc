<p>A new study, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320722000507">published in the April issue of <em>Biological Conservation</em></a>, surveyed the recommendations of scientists for managing biodiversity in the face of climate change, providing a summary of practical guidance and identifying areas in need of further research.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an enormous need to think ahead and be proactive, as well as a growing recognition that we have to act now,&#8221; said senior author Erika Zavaleta, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The climatic conditions to which species have adapted are shifting across the geography of a warming planet, leaving plants, animals, and entire ecosystems in danger of being stranded in places where they can no longer survive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Climate change is causing a mismatch between where species are now and where the habitat and conditions suitable for them are moving,&#8221; Zavaleta said. &#8220;We need to think about where suitable habitats for different ecological communities will be in the future, and how they can get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Climate change is nothing new in the history of our planet, and species have moved and evolved in response to it. But current changes driven by the burning of fossil fuels are happening much faster than past climatic shifts. In addition, the current fragmentation of natural habitats makes it much harder for species to move than it was in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;The need to move is greater while the ability to move is less,&#8221; Zavaleta said. &#8220;Things are changing, and we need to assist the adaptive responses of the natural world if we don&#8217;t want to lose both the species and the amenities they provide for people. We depend on natural ecosystems, and helping them adapt is not separate from helping people and communities adapt to climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new paper updates an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000632070800387X">earlier survey published in 2009</a> by Zavaleta and Nicole Heller, then a postdoctoral researcher in Zavaleta&#8217;s lab. Blair McLaughlin, an assistant professor of ecology at Hampshire College in Massachusetts who earned her Ph.D. in Zavaleta&#8217;s lab and is currently a visiting scholar at UCSC, led the new analysis and is first author of the paper.</p>
<p>The researchers found that current recommendations have gone beyond conceptual guidance to provide more specific and actionable ideas about strategies to implement for particular ecosystems or species. &#8220;There has been a lot more on-the-ground implementation of some of these approaches,&#8221; Zavaleta said.</p>
<h2>Assisted migration</h2>
<p>Longstanding conservation measures, such as protecting and restoring ecosystems and increasing their connectivity, remain critically important in the context of climate change. To address climate-related challenges in particular, however, three novel strategies have received growing attention in recent years: climate change refugia, assisted migration, and protecting climate-adaptive genetics.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think of a valley oak, with acorns that are carried only a short distance by birds and are only viable in the year they are dropped, you can have connectivity but the trees are not going to move at the same pace as the drying that&#8217;s happening in parts of their range,&#8221; Zavaleta explained. &#8220;So do we watch their range contract and disappear? Or do we bank them as seedlings in botanical gardens? And what do we need to be learning now about how to put them back out into the landscape where they can survive?&#8221;</p>
<p>Identifying and protecting areas that can serve as a refuge for species threatened by climate change fits easily within the traditional framework of biodiversity conservation. Creating climate change refugia can include habitat restoration efforts, such as restoring woodland streams to raise the water table.</p>
<p>Assisted migration includes &#8220;assisted gene flow,&#8221; which involves moving organisms between populations within a species&#8217; existing range to preserve genetic diversity, as well as moving species beyond their historical range. This kind of direct intervention to move threatened species into areas where they could have a better chance of survival in the future is not without controversy, however. Concerns include potential impacts on other organisms after translocation, as well as the possibility of harming the targeted population if translocated individuals do poorly in the new site.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like the devil is in the details, but I also think translocation has been mischaracterized as an untested strategy, when actually it has been practiced for over a century and probably longer,&#8221; Zavaleta said. &#8220;Forestry, for example, has a long practice of planting trees from a wide range of locations in areas that are being restored. But we do have a lot more to learn, especially for certain animals and species that are not well understood.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Genetic diversity</h2>
<p>Scientists also want to protect the genetic diversity of species, especially genetic variants that might be better adapted to hotter, drier conditions. &#8220;These are the very conditions that we are likely to see more of in the future,&#8221; McLaughlin said. &#8220;Preserving the climate-adaptive evolutionary potential of a species before it&#8217;s lost is critical to make sure we have the genetic resources we need to help species adapt to novel climate futures.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, oaks at the southern end of their species&#8217; range or that survived a big die-off during a drought might have genetic traits that enhance survival in worsening conditions. Seeds and seedlings from those trees could be protected in a &#8220;gene bank&#8221; so that those traits are not lost.</p>
<p>McLaughlin currently leads a pilot project to create a gene bank for blue oaks in California, which suffered a pronounced die off in the southern part of their distribution during the last drought.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re planting out seedlings from blue oaks that are adapted to hot dry conditions, just so they&#8217;re banked there in case there are more die offs,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In California, it&#8217;s become clear that we need to do this now.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His efforts to address interconnected forms of marginalization during a difficult time in the nation&#8217;s history recognize that these challenges</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electoral, environmental, economic, and epidemiological</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are fraught with issues of intergenerational equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cole will be a keynote speaker at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/event/jrl-college-dedication/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John R. Lewis College dedication ceremony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on May 6. He said that UCSC&#8217;s decision to name College Ten after the late U.S. congressman bears great significance for the university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;When it comes to naming College Ten to be John R. Lewis College, I think about the legacy the late great Congressman left, starting as a youth organizer,&#8221;&#160;</span>Cole said.&#160;<span>&#8220;John R. Lewis embodies the spirit that I believe comes out of Santa Cruz. [UC] Santa Cruz is one of those places with a legacy and a history of strong Black activism on campus.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cole will join powerful keynote speakers LaTosha Brown, co-founder of </span><a href="https://blackvotersmatterfund.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Voters Matter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Black Voters Matter Capacity Building Institute, and Terisa Siagatonu, a College Ten alum, award-winning poet, teaching artist, mental health educator, and community leader. </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/event/jrl-college-dedication/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ceremony is open to the public.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Nine and John R. Lewis College Provost Flora Lu emphasized the excitement surrounding Cole joining the event&#8217;s speaker panel.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is an honor for us to welcome Wisdom back to UCSC to help celebrate the dedication of John R. Lewis College,&#8221; Lu said. &#8220;Wisdom&#8217;s impact is felt on our campus and across the nation, from his efforts as an undergraduate to organize the Afrikan Black Coalition Conference at UCSC to his current role as National Director of the NAACP Youth &amp; College Division. His work reflects a commitment to civil rights, protects democracy, promotes educational equity and access, combats systemic racism, and centers the efforts of students as agents of transformative change. Wisdom continues the legacy of John Lewis and inspires us to do the same.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a legacy of Black activism on campus </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisdom Cole chose to attend UC Santa Cruz for three reasons: It was a top research university, his cousin was attending, and he was ready to get out of the town he grew up in, San Bernardino.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he was 17, he saw San Bernardino as a community for people of color but wished for more political mobilization. He wanted to go somewhere where he could shake things up, somewhere far away from Southern California, and Santa Cruz was his best bet. What he didn&#8217;t expect, however, was to find himself in a town with a Black population of less than 2 percent. The low demographic population paired with the size of the university and its widespread layout made being a Black man on campus challenging for Cole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It can be really isolating,&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;You can go days without seeing another Black person at UC Santa Cruz, and that&#8217;s also one of the reasons I chose Oakes College.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the multi-ethnic community at Oakes College and campus organizations, Cole found his community. He added that UCSC was the place and the space that gave him the words to describe his experience as a Black man in America.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was an RA at Oakes College, an active member of the African Student Union, served as a field and state conference organizer for the Afrikan Black Coalition, and participated in multiple </span><a href="https://someca.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SOMeCA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> leadership courses. In his last year at the university, he joined the African American Theater Arts Troupe (AATAT). Cole said that through his experience with AATAT, he honed his skills in public speaking.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cole came into UCSC pursuing a career in STEM and graduated with a B.A. in Chemistry, but through the connections he was able to cultivate with the Black community at UCSC, he found himself drawn to a path of advocacy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I learned how to love myself as a Black man in America at [UC] Santa Cruz because I was able to connect with other Black students who went through very similar situations in their formative years,&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;People who were the token Black kid in their AP class, people who had been pulled over for no reason, folks whose rights have been violated in different ways. People who had a shared experience with me, I had the opportunity to connect with them.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his third year at the university, Cole organized the Afrikan Black Coalition Conference at UCSC, which hosted prominent speakers Attallah Shabazz, Marc Lamont Hill, Bobby Seale, and UCSC Professor Emerita Angela Davis. The conference was centered around conversations of reimagining Black activism. For organizing the conference, Cole received the Chancellor&#8217;s Achievement Award for Diversity in recognition of outstanding contributions to furthering diversity, inclusion, and excellence at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cole said that coordinating and executing the conference was pivotal in understanding what he wanted to pursue in life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That was really the point in time where it took off for me and I was like, &#8216;this is what I want to do with my life; I can do this every day,&#8217;&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;If I can work to empower young Black people and build solidarity with different communities, then this is what I want to do.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director of SOMeCA, Sayo Fujioka, recalled Cole&#8217;s presence in the classroom.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Wisdom was an inspiring student leader, a role model of purpose and integrity,&#8221; Fujioka said. "I have clear memories of Wisdom listening attentively to students with diverse opinions. His care for others created conditions for growing understanding and consensus."</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in youth and the future</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from UCSC in 2015, Cole pursued an education M.A. in teaching at the University of San Francisco. He then taught mathematics and science at the </span><a href="https://www.jjse.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June Jordan School for Equity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;a San Francisco-based high school predominantly serving working-class communities of color.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I always tell people that if Oakes College made a high school, it would be that high school,&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;But that was a school where I was able to do both; I was able to show myself as a Black mathematician, as a Black scientist, but also recognize my history as a Black man and connect these three concepts that sometimes seem so different, but are actually really similar.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, Cole began working with the NAACP as the National Training and Campaign Manager of the Youth and College Division. He began serving as the National Director of the division in 2021.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cole&#8217;s current efforts are focused on the cancellation of student debt at a minimum of $50,000, police accountability and removing police from schools, and promoting voting rights in marginalized communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cole said he is proud to be an alumnus of UC Santa Cruz and is incredibly proud of the university&#8217;s step toward recognizing College Ten as John R. Lewis College. He said he hopes that the university will continue to support Black students and invest in young leaders in the future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really hope that this naming sets a new precedent for the university when they think about young people of color and young Black people,&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;The fact that I&#8217;m the National Director of the NAACP Youth &amp; College division wasn&#8217;t an accident. There were people who poured into me, gave to me, and made sure that I was on the right path to becoming the person I am today.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/05/images/wisdom-o-cole-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/05/images/wisdom-o-cole-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wisdom-o-cole-featured.jpg</name><display-name>wisdom-o-cole-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>7606</file-size><width>590</width><height>241</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Wisdom Cole</thumb-alt><title>Wisdom Cole: Paving the way for a new generation </title><description>Wisdom Cole (Oakes ’15, chemistry), the national director of the NAACP's Youth &amp; College Division, is a steadfast advocate for Black youth and students—championing campaigns in Black youth voter turnout, removing police from schools, and canceling student debt. </description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="868126c78072704664be42b46c8d9d62"><name>hhmi-learning-community</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC joins multi-institutional effort to advance equity and inclusion in science</title><summary>The HHMI Inclusive Excellence Learning Community initiative is supporting efforts to redesign the introductory science curriculum.</summary><keywords>Grant Hartzog, Robin Dunkin, Erika Zavaleta</keywords><start-date>1651474800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC joins multi-institutional effort to advance equity and inclusion in science</display-name><path>/2022/05/hhmi-learning-community</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/05/hhmi-learning-community</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1651524052647</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1651525419039</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/05/images/big-creek-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/05/images/big-creek-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>big-creek-410.jpg</name><display-name>big-creek-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>127477</file-size><width>410</width><height>363</height></image><image-alt>Big Creek field trip</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/05/images/big-creek-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/05/images/big-creek-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>big-creek-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>big-creek-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27871</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Big Creek field trip</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Studies have demonstrated the value of field courses for boosting the retention and success of underrepresented students in science majors.

<p>In a new initiative funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), UCSC is working on these issues in collaboration with other institutions as part of the HHMI Inclusive Excellence 3 (IE3) Learning Community.</p>
<p>&#8220;UCSC is committed to increasing diversity and inclusion in the sciences, and HHMI has been supporting our efforts in this area for many years,&#8221; said UCSC Chancellor Cindy Larive. &#8220;We have an excellent team of science educators leading this new effort, and I am excited about their collaborative work with other institutions on these issues. Engaging people from different backgrounds is important for addressing inequities and increasing the scientifically trained workforce. It&#8217;s also crucial because it leads to better science.&#8221;</p>
<p>The initiative is focusing on the introductory science curriculum because much of the loss of diversity in the sciences occurs during this critical period of a student&#8217;s college experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;A significant fraction of the students who come to college with an authentic interest in science don&#8217;t make it all the way to earning a science degree, and those kids who are leaving science majors disproportionately come from groups that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines,&#8221; said Grant Hartzog, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology and a member of UCSC&#8217;s IE3 Leadership Team.</p>
<h2>Collaborative approach</h2>
<p>In a departure from its traditional grantmaking, HHMI is taking a collaborative approach for this new inclusive excellence initiative. Each of 104 participating schools was awarded a small grant to support on-campus efforts, and the institutions are also working together in seven Learning Community Clusters.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is one of 15 institutions in Cluster 1, which is focused on making the content of the introductory STEM curriculum more inclusive. The group has been meeting to share ideas and develop a proposal for projects to be funded through additional grants from HHMI.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an opportunity to share experiences and evaluate our efforts as part of a cohort of universities with a common set of values and goals,&#8221; Hartzog said.</p>
<p>At UCSC, the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) is using the initial $30,000 from HHMI to develop an introductory field course for biology students.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that the sooner we get students involved in labs and field research, the better they do,&#8221; Hartzog said. &#8220;The traditional approach to biology education is two years of introductory lecture courses before they get to do the things they&#8217;re really interested in.&#8221;</p>
<p>EEB Professor Erika Zavaleta is coordinating the development of the one-quarter field course, to be offered in conjunction with the lecture-based biology core course in ecology and evolution. &#8220;We want to get students out in the field and have that be part of their experience right off the bat,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They&#8217;ll have a chance to work collaboratively in small groups on real research and build a sense of community with each other and with their instructors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zavaleta said previous studies, such as a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/05/beltran-diversity.html">2020 paper</a> from her group, have demonstrated the value of field courses for boosting the retention and success of underrepresented students in science majors.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz has strong roots in hands-on integrative learning within a community&#8212;that&#8217;s where the campus started&#8212;and I feel like we&#8217;re coming full circle, with a difference now that we are a Hispanic Serving Institution and almost half our students are first-generation,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It means going back to that high-quality experiential approach with even more of an eye to serving students with diverse experiences and perspectives. That&#8217;s what is really exciting.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Active learning</h2>
<p>Hartzog said UCSC&#8217;s biology departments (EEB and MCD Biology) have been working for several years in association with the <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/">Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning</a> (CITL) to revamp their introductory biology courses, developing active learning versions of the large courses. Active learning, which involves various ways of engaging students in &#8220;learning by doing&#8221; instead of listening passively to lectures, is a proven method for increasing student learning and retention in the sciences.</p>
<p>Robin Dunkin, an assistant teaching professor in EEB and assistant faculty director of CITL, said she sees the next phase as building on what has been learned from redesigning the introductory biology and chemistry courses.</p>
<p>&#8220;After several iterations of doing redesigns class by class, this is a chance to think broadly and holistically about our introductory curriculum as a whole,&#8221; Dunkin said. &#8220;We want to think about what that entire first-year experience is like, try to make movement through the curriculum smoother, and help students to see themselves as scientists and feel they belong here at the university and in the discipline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal is to improve graduation rates, admissions to graduate and professional schools, and other metrics for students in the sciences, especially those from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;UCSC is really ahead of the game&#8212;other universities are starting to do things that we&#8217;ve been doing for awhile,&#8221; Hartzog said. &#8220;Our campus&#8217;s superpower is CITL and the work that Robin Dunkin and CITL Director Jody Greene are doing. It makes me feel good about UCSC and the amount of groundwork we&#8217;ve already done.&#8221;</p>
<p>HHMI has helped fund many of these efforts, including the active learning initiative in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. Several biology faculty have received support for science education programs through the HHMI Professors Program, including Zavaleta, MCD Biology Professor Manuel Ares, and EEB Professor Beth Shapiro.</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s IE3 Leadership Team includes Hartzog, Zavaleta, and Dunkin, as well as Susanna Honig, director of the Academic Excellence (ACE) Program; Gage Dayton, director of the UCSC Natural Reserves; Jeremy Lee, professor of MCD biology; and Roxanne Beltran, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="86a20b1b8072704664be42b47ddcbe31"><name>tuffs-david-crossword-puzzles</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Puzzling it out</title><summary>Linguistics student David Tuffs started making crossword puzzles to stave off boredom during COVID-19 restrictions.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions hit, David Tuffs needed to find a way to stave off boredom while confined to his home.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, he made crossword puzzles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a really good way to pass the time,&#8221; said the fourth-year linguistics student at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;If I&#8217;m just in the bedroom, I need something to occupy my mind."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turns out, he was pretty good at it. The 21-year-old Pacific Grove resident just had his third puzzle published in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> His puzzles have also been published in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">L.A. Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Journal.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuffs surprisingly doesn&#8217;t have that much experience with word puzzles. He said his first exposure to word puzzles was watching his grandmother do the difficult British cryptic puzzles (his parents are originally from England). He started playing around with crossword puzzles when he started college.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2019, he was making his own, trying to fit words in a 15-by-15 table on Google Slides. In spring of that year, he got a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crossword subscription.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Doing the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> puzzles showed me how fun and boundary pushing they could be,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is drawn to crossword puzzles because of the wordplay. He especially enjoys finding anagrams&#8212;words or phrases that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another one (i.e., &#8220;peach&#8221; could be rearranged to form &#8220;cheap&#8221;).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been printing crossword puzzles since 1942. Solving one is seen as a point of pride. The puzzle&#8217;s fans say the trick is not so much to have a good vocabulary but to understand what the clues are trying to get you to do.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a way of wording things,&#8221; Tuffs said. &#8220;You have to read into what they&#8217;re going for.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday puzzles are the easiest, with the difficulty increasing each day until Saturday, which has the most difficult puzzles, according to the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/guides/crosswords/how-to-solve-a-crossword-puzzle"><span style="font-weight: 400;">newspaper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sunday puzzles are moderate difficulty but are the biggest.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuffs had his first puzzle published in the newspaper in September 2021 and his most recent, titled &#8220;Ordering Seconds,&#8221; published April 10. The puzzle involved two-word phrases in which the second phrase is an anagram to a different word. For example, &#8220;peanut allergy&#8221; could be a clue for &#8220;peanut gallery.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming up with the puzzle theme is the most fun part, Tuffs said. Then he uses software to help him fill the puzzle in&#8212;a process that takes a few hours. The most challenging part of constructing a puzzle is coming up with the clues for each word. It takes Tuffs days to come up with all the clues for 140 words.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the main thing is he wants to make his puzzles possible for people to solve.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to make it so only two people at the top of their game can solve it,&#8221; Tuffs said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puzzles also have to include references from a wide variety of areas. A puzzle shouldn&#8217;t include only the names of sports figures or actors, for example, he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuffs said he has had several of his puzzles rejected, usually because the editors don&#8217;t like the theme.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important factor in recent years in getting a puzzle accepted is showcasing different perspectives. While in the past, most crossword puzzles were constructed by old white men, that&#8217;s not the case anymore.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, more than 600 crossword constructors and solvers signed an </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rqrdYJJtcHe3jsHyCbMoTJUl2GJ5QiA8ina22ElFzrk/edit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complaining that puzzles were too narrowly focused. They raised concerns about puzzles that are &#8220;disqualified because they include references that are considered unfamiliar to an imagined straight, white, male, and middle-aged audience.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> debuted a new fellowship for crossword constructors with the goal of increasing the number of puzzles created by underrepresented groups such as women, people of color, and those in the LGBTQ community. Five people from 200 applicants were chosen in the first cohort.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuffs said he works hard to make his puzzles relatable to a diverse audience. Getting his puzzles published has led to him meeting some interesting new people. Not long ago, he connected with another Pacific Grove resident who has had 100 puzzles published in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuffs would love to meet more locals&#8212;especially those from underrepresented groups&#8212;interested in crosswords. All they need to do is contact him at </span><a href="mailto:dtuffs@ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dtuffs@ucsc.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the most fun things about crosswords is collaborating,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuffs is completing a combined bachelor&#8217;s/master&#8217;s program at UC Santa Cruz that allows him to graduate with a bachelor&#8217;s degree this year and a master&#8217;s degree next. After finishing school, he hopes to get a job in copyediting or proofreading. But he will continue to experiment with crossword puzzles and other word games.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Crosswords are my main focus because they allow me to create,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good outlet for my creativity.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="86f0e94f8072704664be42b47a678774"><name>terisa-siagatonu</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>International stages to the Quarry, alumna Terisa Siagatonu returns for dedication ceremony </title><summary>UCSC alumna and award-winning poet, Terisa Siagatonu (John R.

Lewis College dedication ceremony on May 6.&#160;</span></i></p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><a href="https://www.terisasiagatonu.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terisa Siagatonu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;award-winning poet, teaching artist, mental health educator, and community leader&#8212;graduated from UC Santa Cruz as a first-generation college student with a B.A. in community studies with a minor in education in 2011. She was introduced to spoken word poetry for the first time in her UCSC dorm in 2006 and has since made a remarkable impact on the poetry community in the Bay Area, around the country, and overseas as a queer Samoan woman and activist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC is honored to welcome Siagatonu back to the university as a speaker at the John R. Lewis College dedication ceremony&#8212;the renaming of the college Siagatonu was once affiliated with.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All of us at College Ten are honored and happy to welcome back Terisa Siagatonu for our naming celebration as John R. Lewis College,&#8221; College Nine and John R. Lewis College Provost Flora Lu said. &#8220;Her connections with College Ten run deep, from her days as a student and neophyte spoken word artist, to now achieving national acclaim for her craft, community organizing, and social justice work.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siagatonu has performed at the White House under the Obama administration and was awarded President Obama&#8217;s Champion of Change Award in 2012 for activism in her Pacific Islander community. She has also performed at the UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris, France.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her work has been published in Poetry Magazine and featured on Button Poetry, CNN, NBCNews, NPR, Huffington Post, KQED, Everyday Feminism, The Guardian, BuzzFeed, and Upworthy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she&#8217;s not performing, Siagatonu facilitates workshops, leads artistic and professional development training, provides mental health clinical support, and delivers keynote speeches across the country. In addition, she has over a decade worth of experience in community work, including youth advocacy, educational attainment, Pacific Islander/Indigenous rights, climate change, LGBTQQIA rights, gender-based violence, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, Siagatonu has stayed connected to UC Santa Cruz on a number of occasions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Terisa gives so generously of her time and talent, from speaking at the Practical Activism Conference and College Ten commencement, to hosting workshops on mental health with the UCSC Resource Centers, to working towards educational equity on campus with Engaging Education,&#8221; Lu added. &#8220;I never cease to be moved and inspired by the power of Terisa&#8217;s prose and presence.&#8221;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Siagatonu will be joined by powerful speakers Latosha Brown&#8212;co-founder of </span><a href="https://blackvotersmatterfund.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Voters Matter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Black Voters Matter Capacity Building Institute&#8212;and Wisdom Cole, the National Director of the National Association of Advancement of Colored People&#8217;s (NAACP) Youth &amp; College Division.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a score of 8-6, the UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs defeated the Bears of Washington University in St. Louis. Selma Malkic and Emma Adams both scored two goals, while Emma Laszlo, Sophia Sussman, Olivia Martinet, and Haley Marshall each contributed single goals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Slugs were off to a strong start, scoring two goals in the first quarter. The third quarter ended with a tie after the Banana Slugs scored two more goals and the Bears scored five goals. The Slugs rallied in the final quarter, scoring three more goals to cement their victory.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The championship marks the first women&#8217;s water polo club championship for UC Santa Cruz and the fourth overall Division III club crown in UC Santa Cruz history. The men&#8217;s club won championships in 2010 (vs. Monmouth College), 2013 (vs. Washington University in St. Louis), and tied with Washington University in St. Louis for the 2014 championship when a power failure at host Bowdoin College prevented the title game from occurring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to securing the 2022 national championship, Shelby Dinh received the tournament&#8217;s Most Valuable Player honor and six Banana Slugs were selected for the all-tournament team:</span></p>

The stories he tells, either through articles, photographs, or videos, shed further light on the atrocities committed against Ukraine and highlight the determination of its people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From live coverage of events on the ground to reporting the aftermath of the destruction of Ukrainian cities, Kramer&#8217;s stories document the war and keep the world informed. One of Kramer&#8217;s more recent articles, published on April 27, emphasizes the grit and courage of residents in Demydiv&#8212;a village north of Kyiv. Ukrainian troops opened a nearby dam in Demyiv, flooding the homes and streets of citizens to keep Russian troops at bay.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The residents of Demydiv paid the price in the rivers of dank green floodwater that engulfed many of their homes. And they couldn&#8217;t be more pleased,&#8221; Kramer&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/27/world/ukraine-russia-war-news#ukrainians-in-one-village-flooded-it-to-keep-russian-forces-at-bay"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reads. &#8220;&#8216;Everybody understands and nobody regrets it for a moment,&#8217; said Antonina Kostuchenko, a retiree, whose living room is now a musty space with waterlines a foot or so up the walls. &#8216;We saved Kyiv!&#8217; she said with pride.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/andrew-e-kramer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">His other articles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cover press conferences with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the U.S. response to the war, stories of refugees, and more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kramer has worked for the Associated Press, The Washington Post, and The San Francisco Chronicle and shares a Pulitzer Prize for international reporting on Russian power with New York Times colleagues. Beforehand, Kramer was part of a team at the Associated Press that was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize on international reporting in 1999.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kramer graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a B.A. in history in 1994, and a master&#8217;s in history from Oxford University.&#160;</span></p>

With its massive redwoods, an onslaught of wild animals, and its stunning seascape&#8212;the immersive campus serves as a classroom both inside and outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she was a student at UCSC, the environmental studies department encouraged McGraw to pursue her passions in conservation fieldwork. She graduated with a B.A. in environmental studies and biology and published a senior thesis that led her to pursue a Ph.D. in integrative biology at UC Berkeley.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is such a naturally beautiful campus; you&#8217;re basically studying in an ecological preserve in many ways,&#8221; McGraw said. &#8220;I had amazing professors and opportunities and a senior thesis that allowed me to chart my own path and do what I want in this field.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at UC Berkeley, McGraw began consulting on projects in the Bay Area, working with clients like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Santa Cruz County, and wrote her book&#8212;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sandhills Conservation and Management Plan</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;for the Land Trust of Santa Cruz County while simultaneously working on her Ph.D. dissertation. Her expertise in conservation planning, habitat restoration, ecological research, GIS spatial analysis and cartography, and consultation has aided in protecting natural lands and species for decades.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With over 30 years of experience in the Santa Cruz mountains and beyond, McGraw has not only worked to protect the Santa Cruz environment, but has also ensured the growth of UCSC students and recent graduates looking for experience in restoration and conservation management fields.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now an expert in the field, McGraw has stayed connected to the environmental studies department at UCSC and has provided essential field experience to upwards of 15 UCSC graduates and sponsored almost 50 interns over the past 15 years through her biological consulting firm&#8212;</span><a href="https://jodimcgrawconsulting.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jodi McGraw Consulting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Restoration Ecology, Conservation Biology, and Environmental Management sound &#8216;glamorous,&#8217; and while most people enjoy the work, it isn&#8217;t necessarily for everyone,&#8221; McGraw said. &#8220;Our internships provide students the opportunity to try out a variety of components of the work and also see which they like the most and want to pursue for their academic or professional careers. Several of our interns have gone on to work in the field or pursue advanced degrees in restoration ecology, conservation biology, and similar fields.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingrid Parker met McGraw at UC Berkeley. While McGraw was a Ph.D. student, Parker was a postdoc in the lab next door. The two UCSC alumni bonded over their time at the university and became good friends.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now a professor in ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, Parker sends many of her students to work with McGraw.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Over the years, I have had the privilege of sending a number of my best students to work with Jodi,&#8221; Parker said. &#8220;At UC Santa Cruz we train students in field methods like plant identification, vegetation survey techniques, statistical analysis, and writing, as well as careful observation and critical thinking skills. Jodi helps these students develop into professionals, learning the lay of the land outside of the classroom.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, Jodi McGraw Consulting took on a sand quarry restoration project that spanned 170 acres. It was a massive undertaking that required the help of interns. It was then that McGraw looked to UCSC students to make up her workforce.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parker said that the skills her students developed working with McGraw in the private sector are some she could not teach them in the classroom, and is grateful for the partnership between UCSC and Jodi McGraw Consulting.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Over Jodi&#8217;s years of Ph.D. studies, she had learned so much about the rare plants of Santa Cruz, and had made a name for herself as one of the most trusted experts in the region in rare plant conservation and land management,&#8221; Parker said. &#8220;Jodi&#8217;s entrepreneurial spirit and total dedication to her conservation work is what made it possible for her to create her own career path.&#160; She built a renowned consulting firm from the ground up, and her impact in saving California biodiversity has been truly inspiring.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angelica Amesquita graduated from UCSC in 2013 with a B.S. in plant sciences and minors in chemistry and Latin America and Latino studies. Upon graduating, Amesquita&#8217;s thesis advisor, Ingrid Parker, referred Amesquita to Jodi McGraw Consulting.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I gravitate towards strong women business owners and strong women in science,&#8221; Amesquita said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always admired Jodi in that way; she&#8217;s a really positive role model as someone who&#8217;s successful in the sciences and has her own business. It&#8217;s inspiring for me to work with somebody who&#8217;s very dedicated to their work on many levels.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a full-time employee, Amesquita said she was given the opportunity to work on various projects which helped her with her own career development, and worked with a handful of UCSC interns.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I was an undergraduate, I was pretty involved in projects with different professors and volunteering for different graduate students,&#8221; Amesquita said. &#8220;I was getting my hands on anywhere I could think of, and if this internship had existed at the time, I definitely would have applied for it.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amesquita worked in-person with Jodi McGraw Consulting for over two years before moving to Seattle in 2016 where she continued to work remotely. Beginning in Spring 2017, Amesquita no longer worked full-time for Jodi McGraw Consulting, but remains a good friend of McGraw&#8217;s and occasionally visits Santa Cruz to help with large projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGraw and Amesquita agreed that working with staff and interns who had attended UCSC was a unique experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s fun; we would talk about having the same professors and all of the cool places on campus,&#8221; McGraw said. &#8220;You&#8217;re coming from the same sort of academic background and shared campus life experience.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to staying connected to the campus community through her staff and interns, McGraw has also taught a handful of classes at the university, including the natural history field quarter and taking over Parker&#8217;s plant sciences course while she was on maternity leave.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGraw says she is grateful to stay connected to the campus community; however, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant turnover in her firm&#8217;s workforce. McGraw says she is hopeful to provide more internship opportunities to students and is currently searching for an intern that can aid in monitoring an endangered beetle at night. &#160;</span></p>

The program connects the campus, alumni, and broader community with UC Santa Cruz scholars to read deeply together. </span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 Deep Read is already underway. The annual program of The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz has brought together students, faculty, alumni, and other curious minds from across the globe to unpack and discuss </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcendent Kingdom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the most recent novel by Ghanaian-American author Yaa Gyasi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The novel follows Gifty, a Neuroscience PhD student at Stanford and first-generation American born to Ghanaian immigrants who is seeking to understand the psychological roots of addiction and depression&#8212;a focus inspired by the death of her older brother to a heroin overdose and her mother&#8217;s ongoing despair. Through her present-day interactions with her mom and a series of flashbacks, Gifty begins to wrestle with much larger concerns like her experiences growing up in the rural South, her father&#8217;s disappearance, and, crucially, how to balance her religious upbringing with her secular scientific surroundings.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like Gyasi&#8217;s first novel </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homegoing,</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcendent Kingdom </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has earned all manner of critical praise. In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, author Nell Freudenberger praised the book, writing, &#8220;The transcendent kingdom of this Ghanaian, Southern, American novel is finally not a Christian or a scientific one, but the one that two women create by surviving a hostile environment, and maintaining their primal connection to each other.&#8221; And in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, critic Ron Charles hailed it as &#8220;a novel of profound scientific and spiritual reflection that recalls the works of Richard Powers and Marilynne Robinson.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversation about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcendent Kingdom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has begun through email explorations, a weekly newsletter featuring discussion questions and ideas drawn from UC Santa Cruz faculty, as well as a robust online forum. But, starting this week, Deep Readers will have a chance to participate in two in-person events that will continue the dialogue surrounding Gyasi&#8217;s book.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kicking things off is a Faculty Salon that will be held on May 4 at the Cowell Hay Barn starting at 6pm. UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia K. Larive will be joined by Vilashini Cooppan, Professor of Literature and Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, and Gina Athena Ulysse, Professor of Feminist Studies, for what will surely be a lively and insightful discussion of the novel. The Deep Read community is encouraged to attend in person, but there will be a livestream available for those outside of the area. Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWBddJlpbGtWlH9Diql4_I9KMY04fI5w2OVv-3tjrk0zzFZg/viewform">here</a> to RSVP.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps even more exciting is the event on May 15 at 4pm at the Quarry Amphitheater. The author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcendent Kingdom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Yaa Gyasi will be appearing in person for a conversation with UC Santa Cruz Professor Emerita of Literature, and recent recipient of the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from The National Book Foundation, Karen Tei Yamashita. The two acclaimed writers will be discussing a broad range of topics, including the experiences of first-generation students in higher education and the struggles of immigrants seeking to assimilate into American culture.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration for the event with Yaa Gyasi is <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-ucsc-deep-read-a-conversation-with-yaa-gyasi-tickets-310791213887">free</a>, but unlike the Faculty Salon, there will be no livestreamed option. If you can attend in person, you don&#8217;t want to miss it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>The 2022 Deep Read Program is made possible through the generous support of the Helen and Will Webster Foundation, and is a product of a close collaboration among a growing group of campus and community partners.

<p>Established in 1994 by the eminent writers Carlos Fuentes and Gabriel Garc&#237;a M&#225;rquez, the Julio Cort&#225;zar Latin American Chair is one of the most prestigious recognitions for artists and intellectuals in Latin America. The activities of the chair include a free public lecture and a multi-day conference for specialists and students.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am honored to be one of a handful of Latin American scientists to be recognized by this prestigious chair,&#8221; said Ramirez-Ruiz, a theoretical astrophysicist who holds the Vera Rubin Presidential Chair for Diversity in Astronomy at UCSC.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz will give the public &#8220;Master Conference&#8221; on May 4 at the University of Guadalajara. His talk is titled, &#8220;On the galactic bestiary and the origin of the elements.&#8221; A leading authority on some of the most dramatic events in the universe, Ramirez-Ruiz studies violent astrophysical phenomena such as collisions, mergers, and disruptions of stars&#8212;especially those involving compact objects like black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz has received many awards and honors, both for his scientific achievements and for his leadership in supporting and mentoring students from underrepresented groups in the sciences. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Mexican Academy of Sciences, he was honored by the White House in February with a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring.</p>
<p>Fuentes and Garc&#237;a M&#225;rquez founded the Julio Cort&#225;zar Latin American Chair with funds from a scholarship program established by the Mexican government. They wanted to pay tribute to Cort&#225;zar, one of the greatest Latin American writers of the 20th century, and provide a forum for dialogue and reflection on Latin American society and culture. Previous holders of the chair include Toni Morrison, Jos&#233; Saramago, Noam Chomsky, Elena Poniatowska, Jared Diamond, and Ernesto Cardenal.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91491d548072704664be42b481be37ae"><name>uc-emeriti-award-john-brown-childs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>John Brown Childs earns UC’s highest system-wide award for emeriti</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Sociology John Brown Childs is a 2021-2022 recipient of the Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award, which recognizes exceptional legacies of research, teaching, and service. &#13;

On May 2, Childs was selected as a 2021-2022 recipient of the Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award, which recognizes exceptional legacies of research, teaching, and service.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the award&#8217;s creation in 1983, 49 University of California emeriti professors have received the honor. Childs is the ninth recipient from UC Santa Cruz. He is a pioneer in community-engaged scholarship for social justice whose work draws upon the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and peacemaking practices of the Haudenosaunee/Iroquois Confederacy. Childs&#8217; theory of </span><a href="https://tupress.temple.edu/book/3566"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transcommunality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers methods for cooperation between diverse groups, centered upon the ethics of mutual respect.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He retired in 2009, after teaching at UC Santa Cruz for more than 20 years, but has remained a leader in many projects across campus. That includes the naming of College Ten for </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/college-ten-announcement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John R. Lewis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;and the development of a course called </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/03/childs-soledad.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcommunal Peace Making</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that brings together UCSC undergraduates and incarcerated men from the&#160; Correctional Training Facility in Soledad to learn collaboratively. He&#8217;s also working on a book, called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voices from Soledad Prison,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on his partnership of more than a decade with the </span><a href="https://barriosunidos.net/prisonproject/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barrios Unidos Prison Project</span></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I cannot think of another colleague who exhibits the same dedication and passion in enacting their scholarship toward healing the wounds and divides in our society,&#8221; said Flora Lu, Provost of John R. Lewis College and College Nine, who was among Childs&#8217; nominators for the award. &#8220;Professor Childs&#8217; intellectual work is inextricable from his commitment to moral values and elevating the wisdom of people who are minoritized and marginalized.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>"Professor Childs originated the Sociology Department&#8217;s now central focus on community-engaged research and&#160;continues to have a major impact on social justice efforts and organizations in Santa Cruz County and beyond," said Sociology Chair Miriam Greenberg, another of Childs' nominators. "He is a leader in seeking restorative alternatives to gang and youth violence, in creating critical intellectual and community-building space for people&#8212;particularly men and youth&#8212;who are incarcerated, and in developing opportunities for youth leadership that bridge campus and community."</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back over his career, Childs says contributing to creating a better society has long been his dream. And learning, teaching, and community-engaged work are all interconnected endeavors on that pathway. In many ways, he&#8217;s also following in the footsteps of his ancestors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child&#8217;s paternal ancestors were among a group of Black families who helped to found Lincoln Normal School, one of the first schools for African American teachers and students established after the Civil War. He&#8217;s also an enrolled member of the Massachusett Tribe at Ponkapoag, and his scholarly approach is heavily influenced by Native American prophet Deganawidah, or &#8220;the Peacemaker.&#8221; Deganawidah helped to bring peace among five warring Indigenous nations, resulting in the founding of the Haudenosaunee/Iroquois Confederacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Transcommunality is drawn from the Peacemaker&#8217;s ways of reaching peace among those who are at war,&#8221; Childs said. &#8220;Deganawidah is very much alive for me, so in a way, I&#8217;m just passing on his message of peace and constructive, positive interaction.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Childs&#8217; work has also been influenced by his involvement in the civil rights movement, which taught him the philosophy of nonviolence and the power of community organizing. As a college student, Childs organized a group of students to attend the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. And through the organization Friends of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, he participated in voter registration efforts in the South in 1965, shortly after &#8220;Bloody Sunday,&#8221; when John Lewis and other civil rights activists had been brutally beaten. These experiences </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/01/voting-rights-civil-rights.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inform Childs&#8217; work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to this day.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I saw some very scary things,&#8221; Childs recalled. &#8220;I saw and experienced violence. But I also saw the courage and hopefulness of the people involved in the movement. And, ultimately, I saw the impact that had and the changes that happened. I learned that what seems immovable is actually movable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Childs continues to play his part in working to create a better society, and he has inspired countless others within the university and community to join him on that path. He says the relationships he&#8217;s built along the way have been one of the biggest high points of his career.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being at UCSC has just been the best career and life experience I&#8217;ve had because of the academic and community interconnections that exist here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What has kept me going over the years is working with people who share the ethical spirit of doing good in the world, to the best of one's ability. And I sure plan to continue that, as long as God lets me be here.&#8221;</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="94b756858072704664be42b48a9eec31"><name>80-years-later</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title> UC Santa Cruz Dean of the Arts Division Celine Parreñas Shimizu will debut her latest film at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival on May 12</title><summary>Filmmaker and film scholar Celine Parreñas Shimizu, UCSC’s Dean of the Division of Arts, debuts her new documentary at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival on May 12.

The feature film 80 YEARS LATER explores the racial inheritance of Japanese American family incarceration during World War II through multigenerational conversations with survivors and their descendants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;On the 80th anniversary of Executive Order 9066 that imprisoned 120,000 Japanese Americans in World War II, families still grapple with the legacy of their experience,&#8221; says Parre&#241;as Shimizu. &#8220;I wanted to explore the question: how does one inherit traumatic history across generations?&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parre&#241;as Shimizu began with her own father-in-law, Dr. Tadashi Robert Shimizu. A much loved and respected chief resident at Oakland Children&#8217;s Hospital for one year and East Bay pediatrician for 39 years, Shimizu was relocated as a small boy with his family from their home in San Leandro, CA to the Poston Internment Camp in Arizona.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also spotlighted, Kiyoko Kasai Fujiu grew up in San Francisco&#8217;s Japantown, pre-war images of which are included in the film. Fujiu was evacuated to Tanforan in San Bruno, CA, a racetrack where the family was forced to live in horse stalls. Fujiu moved to Chicago after incarceration, before the war ended.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the film, Parre&#241;as Shimizu employed a distinctive approach, gathering children and grandchildren around these two elders to explore, in conversation with one another, the impact that Executive Order 9066 has had on all of their lives&#8212;the choices they made, their relationships with each other, and their own individual sense of identity. The result is a moving and tender portrait of these families as they share memories both painful and joyous, reflect on the inheritance of their histories, and process these together to form a new understanding of themselves and one another.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small moments take on poignant significance. Shimizu, who, as a teen after the war, was envious of his brother for having an American first name and worked hard to excel at all things American like football, pauses deep in thought when his multiracial grandson expresses his desire to immerse himself in his heritage. Short scenes throughout the film of the quite frail and elderly Fujiu being lovingly cared for by her family are the prelude to a gathering at which these next generations collectively realize their responsibility to keep her story alive as America forgets its history and hate crimes against Asians rise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parre&#241;as Shimizu&#8217;s other films, distributed by Third World Newsreel, Women Make Movies and Progressive Films, include </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Celine Archive </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2020)&#8212;a creative documentary that brings together animation, portraiture, interviews, site visits, and archival materials to explore the story of Celine Navarro, a Filipina immigrant woman murdered by her community in 1932 Northern California. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Celine Archive</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earned the Culver City Film Festival&#8217;s Grand Prize for Best Documentary Feature among 8 other festival awards. Others include </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birthright: Mothering Across Difference</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2009), <em>T</em></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">he Fact of Asian Women</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2004) and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Flip</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1997). &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parre&#241;as Shimizu, the first woman of color to serve as Dean at UCSC, brings the concerns of her art practice to her new leadership role at the school. &#8220;My mission is to help our faculty, students, and alumni to deploy the ability of the arts to create new and needed narratives, to bring communities together, to imagine and make real new worlds not yet here, to amplify an abundance of voices, and to keep the definition of the arts fervently open,&#8221; she states.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parre&#241;as Shimizu has initiated a sweeping Diversity, Equity and Inclusion agenda in the Division that promises to be a national model, and will build on UCSC&#8217;s discipline-bending art programs, including a one-of-a-kind Social Documentation MFA for future documentarians committed to social change and to documenting communities, cultures, issues, and individuals who are marginalized in our current landscape of representation.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As commencement nears and nostalgia for alumni kicks in, Novellus is looking forward to speaking at her alma mater&#8217;s 2022 commencement ceremony.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"When Dean Wolf reached out to ask if I&#8217;d be this year&#8217;s commencement speaker, I was beyond excited! To have the opportunity to address an audience of future change-makers on one of the most important days of their lives is an incredible honor,&#8221; Novellus said. &#8220;It&#8217;s also a huge responsibility that I do not take lightly. My goal is for every Baskin grad to walk away with a sense of pride in themselves for arriving at this moment. I want them to feel confident that their dreams for their life are achievable and that they have the power to create their reality&#8212;no matter what the world says.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Novellus continued, &#8220;These are the messages that helped me through my journey as a computer engineering student at Baskin. During moments of self-doubt, I had a mother who poured words of encouragement into me until I felt whole again. Now I have a similar opportunity, but instead of making students whole, I get to energize them for the next chapter of their lives. What a full circle moment! I am eternally grateful."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9a05b2f18072704664be42b48b672ebc"><name>composer-residencies-pamela-z</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>May concerts of new work by UC Santa Cruz composers the result of residencies with leading new music artists</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz doctoral students in composition will premiere several new works this May developed during two unprecedented residencies with top names in the experimental music world.</summary><start-date>1651820400000</start-date><path>/2022/05/composer-residencies-pamela-z</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/05/composer-residencies-pamela-z</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1651851506395</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1651851506395</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Music</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Nina Sazevich</name><title></title><phone/><email>nina@sazevichpr.com</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/05/pamela-z.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/05/pamela-z.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pamela-z.jpg</name><display-name>pamela-z.jpg</display-name><file-size>13816</file-size><width>465</width><height>311</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/05/pamela-z-thumb.png</path><link>site://news/2022/05/pamela-z-thumb.png</link><site>news</site><name>pamela-z-thumb.png</name><display-name>pamela-z-thumb.png</display-name><file-size>7650</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pamela Z &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Photo by Marion Gray)</span></p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz doctoral students in composition will premiere several new works this May developed during two unprecedented residencies with top names in the experimental music world&#8212;pioneering composer, performer, and media artist Pamela Z and celebrated piano/percussion quartet Yarn/Wire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two extended residencies, which began earlier this year, are a first for UCSC&#8217;s Music Department, offering the emerging composers access to these leading artists over several months to workshop ideas, receive one-on-one mentoring, and work collaboratively towards a culminating performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been the highlight of my experience at UCSC,&#8221; says Seth Glickman, who was selected to participate in both residencies. &#8220;To be in direct contact with artists like these who are pursuing new ideas in music and the performance of it, and getting a close up view of their process, is so incredibly valuable. It&#8217;s made me really stretch and expand as a composer.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glickman and fellow doctoral student Alex Wand will take the stage with Pamela Z May 14 at 7pm for a </span><a href="https://ias.ucsc.edu/events/2022/may-14-pamela-z-concert"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Rio Theatre in downtown Santa Cruz to debut the work they developed as part of the residency. &#8220;It&#8217;s rare for a guest artist to launch the idea of building a collaborative concert with students in this way,&#8221; says Associate Professor of Music Ben Leeds Carson who oversaw the residencies. &#8220;It&#8217;s so incredible for them that it will be a shared stage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Glickman and Wand were inspired to work with text and voice in new ways for the pieces they will present. Pamela Z, a pioneer of live digital looping techniques, processes her voice in real time to create dense, complex sonic layers. Her solo works combine experimental extended vocal techniques, operatic bel canto, found objects, text, and sampled concrete sounds. &#8220;I love how Pamela Z draws from diverse inspirations,&#8221; says Wand. &#8220;She really broadens the conception of what it is to be a composer.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concert, which is part of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences&#8217; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surge: Explorations in Afrofuturism</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series, will feature a number of outstanding musicians who will perform both with Pamela Z on her solo works and with the two students. They include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC faculty Kyle Bruckman and Willie Winant, both of whom are fixtures in the Bay Area experimental music scene. Support for the guest performers was provided by an equity and innovation grant from the Arts Research Institute and by funds raised by the Music Department on UCSC&#8217;s Fall 2021 Giving Day campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glickman, along with doctoral students Nina Barzegar, Rodrigo Barriga, and Ben Dorfan, will have new work performed in a </span><a href="https://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/yarnwire-tenri-cultural-institute-nyc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Yarn/Wire May 20 in New York, another first for the UCSC Music Department. There will be a livestream for remote audiences, 5pm Pacific.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the first time an ensemble has decided to take several of our students' work &#8216;on the road&#8217; so-to-speak, bringing their work to New York City, where it can have distinctive exposure to new potential collaborations and recognition,&#8221; says Carson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yarn/Wire is one of the leading chamber ensembles working today and internationally known for commissioning out-of-the-box thinkers in creative music. The group&#8217;s residency with the UCSC students was particularly revelatory, offering the emerging composers the opportunity to see an ensemble work through their pieces in real time and to receive extensive feedback over many iterations of the compositional process. &#8220;They are such skilled performers,&#8221; says Glickman. &#8220;Sharing excerpts with them really affected how I completed the piece.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carson is committed to ensuring that residencies like these continue to be an annual opportunity for students. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a privilege to see how these rare interactions and the dialogue within them have led to a phenomenal development of the voices of these dynamic and developing composers.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9b0612568072704664be42b47d994c45"><name>isaacnewtonlecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>The Newton you don't know</title><summary>Caltech professor Jed Buchwald will lecture on Isaac Newton’s attempt to change the history of civilization at inaugural Nauenberg Lecture on May 13&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you may not know is that the famed British mathematician also aimed to overturn the history of civilization, had views that amounted to religious heresy during his lifetime, and never got bonked on the head by that convenient but apocryphal apple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">History Professor Jed Z. Buchwald of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) will present these fascinating but lesser-known aspects of Newton at the inaugural Nauenberg History of Science Lecture at 5:30 p.m., May 13 in an online event.&#160;</span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/jed-buchwald-isaac-newton-and-the-origin-of-civilization/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration is availabe online for this free event.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nauenberg History of Science Lecture was established to honor </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/07/nauenberg-in-memoriam.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Nauenberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a founding Physics Department faculty member who came to UCSC in 1966, only a year after the campus opened to students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his distinguished academic career, he contributed to a broad range of fields, including particle physics, condensed matter physics, astrophysics, chaos theory, fluid dynamics, and the history of physics in the 17th and 18th centuries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nauenberg believed in the importance of interdisciplinary scholarship connecting sciences with the humanities. After retiring in 1994, he pursued his interests in the history of science, writing books and articles about Joseph Banks, Robert Hooke, Christiaan Huygens, and Isaac Newton.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, he became the only scientist to receive the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2013/05/nauenberg-award.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of California Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an honor normally given to professors in the humanities and social sciences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Professor Nauenberg died in 2019, the UCSC Emeriti Association and the Nauenberg family established a History of Science Lecture series in the spirit of his </span><a href="https://emeriti.ucsc.edu/files/Nauenberg1999_histsci.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1999 proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nauenberg&#8217;s daughter, Saskia </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nauenberg Dunkell, fondly remembered his penchant for brainstorming.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He was always brimming with ideas and notorious for scribbling thoughts on napkins or random pieces of paper,&#8221; said Nauenberg Dunkell, Research Program Manager at The Humanities Institute at UCSC. &#8220;If you asked him a question about how the world worked, he would set up an experiment to show you the way it happened and teach you how to figure out the answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For his history of science research, my dad sought out original writings and drawings preserved in special collections all over the world,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;He taught himself Latin in order to read some of these old manuscripts and exchanged ideas with many history of science scholars, including Jed Buchwald.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buchwald will delve into aspects of Newton&#8217;s life that will surprise non-experts, including his attempts to amend history.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the latter course of his career, Newton paid a good deal of attention to the way in which human civilization evolved since the [Biblical] flood occurred,&#8221; Buchwald said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the days of Newton, it was broadly accepted that the universe had been created roughly 6,000 years before, following the timeline established in the Bible, Buchwald said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he accepted the idea of the flood, Newton rejected many other aspects of Biblical thought, including Christ&#8217;s divinity and the concept of the Trinity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He thought that Christ was a human who had certain&#8212;shall we say&#8212;divinely inspired powers but did not believe he rose from the dead because he did not believe in the Trinity. That could get you into a lot of trouble in those days,&#8221; Buchwald said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newton got away with such views because he wrote them down in his journals, and though he confided in some of his peers, he did not go around trumpeting such ideas to the general public.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newton believed in the teachings of the Bible, but he dissented from fundamentalist views.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By today&#8217;s standards, Newton was quite a deeply religious man who cast a gimlet eye on the claims of the Old and New Testament,&#8221; Buchwald said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He did not like miracles very much, at least not after Creation, and he did not believe that Methuselah lived for 900 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Conversely, he had to play around with the chronology of human civilization in order to make it conform to what he thought would be normal human lifespans,&#8221; Buchwald added.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That goal was one of the reasons behind Newton&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in 1728, a year after Newton&#8217;s death. In this book, he amended the generally accepted timeline for ancient civilizations, contracting Greek history by 500 years and Egypt&#8217;s by 1,000 years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, the one fact that most people believe they know about Newton&#8212;that he devised laws of universal gravitation after being bonked in the head by an apple&#8212;never took place.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buchwald said the anecdote compresses decades of Newton&#8217;s slowly developing thoughts about mechanics and planetary motion.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The apple incident did not happen, and as a colleague of mine in England said, the role of fruit in the history of science has been greatly exaggerated,&#8221; Buchwald said.</span></p>

Lewis College
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of campus and regional community members gathered beneath the redwoods encircling Quarry Amphitheater to watch the former College Ten make history, rededicating itself as </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/college-ten-announcement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John R. Lewis College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in memory of the legendary civil rights leader.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Naming is a unique act,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive at the ceremony. &#8220;It allows us to honor the past and aspire to the future. We&#8217;re proud to have the opportunity to live up to the name John R. Lewis. Representative John R. Lewis was an icon in this country&#8217;s historic struggle for freedom, equality, democracy, and basic human rights for all."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crowd gathered in a festive atmosphere under sunny skies to be inspired by powerful speakers and witness history in the making&#8212;and, true to UC Santa Cruz's roots and John R. Lewis's practice, students engaged in protest and let their voices be heard at the event, advocating for labor rights, housing, basic needs support, and mental health care.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speakers included UCSC Professor Emeritus and Sociologist </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/01/voting-rights-civil-rights.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Brown Childs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; Rev. Dwight Andrews of the First Congregational Church of Atlanta, who was a friend of Lewis's; award-winning poet </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/05/terisa-siagatonu.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terisa Siagatonu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (John R. Lewis &#8217;11, community studies); organizer, political strategist, and jazz singer LaTosha Brown; civil rights advocate </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/05/wisdom-cole.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisdom Cole</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Oakes '15, chemistry); and UC President Michael Drake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drake said he had the honor of meeting and spending time with Lewis a few years ago.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It was a special joy, and the fact that the university is coming together to name this college for him to serve as a platform for remembering his name and remembering his work as we go forward I think is something that we're all very proud of," Drake said.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Supporting the fight</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ceremony, honoring the first UC Santa Cruz college to be named after a person of color, took place 57 years after John R. Lewis set off on a march from Selma, Ala., to Montgomery with 600 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The peaceful demonstrators faced tear gas and beatings at the hands of state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and others at the end of Edmund Pettus Bridge. And though Lewis was badly wounded, the march renewed his determination to fight for racial equity, a mission that sustained him throughout his life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis became an organizer whose bravery and conviction helped pave the way for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He later served 30-plus years in the House of Representatives, where he became known as the &#8220;conscience of Congress&#8221; for his commitment to justice and equity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolanda Pierre Dixon, a lawyer from San Jose, and her sister Adrienne Pierre, a retired counselor for De Anza College, came to the event to honor Lewis and support the fight for civil rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We just want to kind of keep these things going and understand that we have to honor those that came before us," said Pierre Dixon. "And &#8230; even though the fight continues, these people put their lives on the line, and we have to recognize the kind of battle it's going to take."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gamliel Urlanda (Oakes '21, mathematics) of Santa Cruz and student Ino Salva (Merrill '23, psychology and critical race and ethnic studies) are part of the student organization </span><a href="https://bayanihanucsc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bayanihan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which Urlanda said is partnered with the </span><a href="https://sua.ucsc.edu/assembly/representatives/past/bsu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Student Union</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BSU). They attended the event in support of the BSU.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Their causes are also our causes," said Urlanda. "We want to make sure we help each other as people of color on campus."&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Honor and responsibility</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The naming was made possible by a&#160; gift from donors who prefer to remain anonymous. The gift established a permanent endowment that will provide resources in perpetuity for programming and other needs of the college under the direction of the college provost.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first college that UCSC has named since 2016, when College Eight was named for the pioneering environmentalist Rachel Carson, a marine biologist best known for her groundbreaking nonfiction book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silent Spring.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"To have a college in [John Lewis's] name is both an incredible honor and responsibility," said Larive. "This naming affirms our deep commitment to help students become agents for justice, equity, inclusivity, and social change, and challenges us to live the spirit of activism embodied by Representative Lewis.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for that kind of activism in the current political climate was reflected in speakers' remarks.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This dedication comes at a tumultuous time for our country," said President Drake. "We are confronting intense personal, professional, and political challenges every day. We're still in the midst of an unrelenting global pandemic. We continue to witness and live the brutal realities of intolerance, racism, and injustice."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, said Drake, John Lewis showed us that there can be hope, even in hard times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Today more than ever we need John Lewis's spirit, his worldview of compassion, his willingness to do hard, practical work of making freedom, justice, and equality real. Our democracy today faces severe, perilous challenges," said Brown Childs. " &#8230; To meet these challenges, let us honor him as an icon, but let us also be inspired by him as a guide in dangerous times."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Referring to recent laws enacted to restrict voting and reproductive health care, Andrews called the dedication "a powerful moment, a response to all of the backward steps that are going on in our nation and in our world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I often say that we are in the midst of a pandemic of pandemics," Andrews continued. "Not just the coronavirus, but the economic virus, the educational crisis, the crisis of violence that strikes at the very core of our sense of safety and wellbeing, all of these crises are creating an epidemic of pandemics, all converging at the same time, so we need to be here today."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LaTosha Brown challenged the audience to imagine an America without racism, and said changing the world is not about politics, but about humanity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"How will we stand in a space of our humanity where it becomes real?" Brown asked. "One way that we can all check ourselves is are we giving ourselves grace, and space? What's so wrong with a little grace? What's so wrong with a little space? Giving ourselves and each other the space to shift, to learn, to grow, to evolve."&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Students speak</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the program&#8217;s call to action, representatives of the Black Student Union spoke, addressing Chancellor Larive and President Drake.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xaul Starr, also known as X (Stevenson '22, Earth science; Black studies minor), BSU president, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airielle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Silva (John R. Lewis College '25, critical race and ethnic studies; Black studies minor), BSU chair of political and cultural affairs, pressed campus administrators for urgency in addressing Black students' needs and demands.</span></p>
<p>"This is where the frustration kicks in," said Starr. "The frustration of [un]kept promises, the long-awaited meetings that never seem to happen, the pile of work, advocacy, labor, tireless nights that fall onto students to make sure that the administration follows through on the work that they should be doing to see their students survive."</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the event, Chancellor Larive said that campus leaders are continuing to work closely with student leaders to address identified needs within the university&#8217;s control and help champion changes that are needed beyond our campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/college-ten-profile-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Ten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had already distinguished itself as a place where future leaders and activists can immerse themselves in the theory and practice of effective, on-the-ground activism. All entering students take courses examining the roots of prejudice and violence; learn to think critically about privilege, inequality, and forms of resistance; and embrace their shared humanity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now the college&#8212;one of the 10 living-and-learning communities, or colleges, at UC Santa Cruz that enhance the intellectual and social life of the campus&#8212;is receiving additional funding to support student programming, publicity, and an outpouring of support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, it&#8217;s positioning itself to attract more of the politically active students it has been educating, nurturing, and inspiring since its founding in 2002, and raising funds to bolster its anonymous $5 million endowment gift.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now is the time not only to highlight and uplift the work that College Ten has been doing for the past 20 years, but also infuse the values of John R. Lewis into our existing curriculum initiatives,&#8221; said Sarah Woodside Bury, senior director for college student life at College Nine and John R. Lewis, Cowell, and Stevenson colleges.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="aef7b4dc8072704664be42b45fcb33ba"><name>cres-department</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New Department of Critical Race and Ethnic Studies invites students to think critically about race during a time of global reckoning with racism</title><summary>CRES was first introduced as a degree program in 2014 and, thanks to its rapid growth and strong faculty and student advocacy, gained departmental status in 2021.&#13;

<p>&#8220;CRES developed out of student struggle, and in our course topics, our teaching methods, and our degree programs, we hold ourselves accountable to students who for decades have called for deep, nuanced approaches to race in the classroom,&#8221; said Christine Hong, chair of the department.</p>
<p>CRES was first introduced as a degree program in 2014 and, thanks to its rapid growth and strong faculty and student advocacy, gained departmental status in 2021.</p>
<p>Mary &#8220;Miki&#8221; Arlen (Porter &#8216;21) came to UC Santa Cruz to study literature, and decided in her junior year to add critical race and ethnic studies as a second major after learning about the program from Hong.</p>
<p>&#8220;Critical race studies and critical race theory is recognizing that we don&#8217;t have as broad a perspective in the narrative of the United States,&#8221; Arlen said. &#8220;It really is a shifting of perspective&#8212;of understanding our own positionality in the classroom and in the world, and giving a space to those voices that aren&#8217;t necessarily heard all the time in history classrooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrea Duran, CRES major and peer advisor, stated, &#8220;CRES gave me a scholastic home to explore difficult and oftentimes painful questions relating to life in this settler colonial society. My classmates and teachers created safe spaces to expand and honor my &#8216;radical&#8217; beliefs; our classrooms became places to feel angry, desperate, hopeful, and self-determined.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CRES program casts a wide net with courses that touch on a range of topics and issues from poverty and public policy to ethnic studies in K-12 public education to the history of jazz in America to comparative settler colonial critique. Popular courses include Racial Capitalism, Black Queer Culture, Indigenous Feminisms, and Pilipinx Historical Dialogue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels great that CRES is something that has galvanized students and faculty,&#8221; said Xavier Livermon, associate professor in CRES and Black Studies director, &#8220;and that the administration listened to their concerns and has been willing to put the resources behind trying to make this happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the development of this program feels timely considering ongoing discussions about critical race theory and broad-based organizing against racial violence in our current moment, the seeds for CRES were planted with UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s first graduating class in 1969.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students took over the commencement stage and turned their backs to the audience in protest against the violence of the U.S. military in Vietnam,&#8221; said Hong, associate professor of CRES and literature. &#8220;But they also turned their backs to the audience protesting the racism of this campus and calling for ethnic studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the years since that moment, students have raised their voices to demand for a more diverse range of classes at UC Santa Cruz. In 1981, 600 students marched to the chancellor&#8217;s office calling for the hiring of professors for Asian American Studies and Native American Studies, which resulted in two tenure-track hires. A few years later, students successfully petitioned for the creation of the Ethnicity and Race general education requirement.</p>
<p>As the baton continued to be passed along to incoming students pushing for radical change within UC Santa Cruz, an autonomous student organization with ties to E2 and other organizing spaces, along with some key faculty members like Hong and History of Consciousness professor Eric Porter, began a serious push for an Ethnic Studies program in 2011.</p>
<p>&#8220;We began meeting initially about once a week,&#8221; Hong said. &#8220;Then it became every single day, and sometimes more than once a day. We fought at a time when the landscape had totally shifted, and we were on the heels of a major recession that resulted in budget cuts throughout the university.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their efforts were ultimately successful with the introduction of a CRES degree program. Through the dedication and hard work of staff and faculty, the major was able to hit growth targets&#8212;and it has proven to be the fastest growing major in the division.</p>
<p>The student interest has enabled the department to expand as well. In just a few years, its faculty numbers have doubled as more chose to affiliate themselves with the department. CRES added the Black Studies minor, working closely with the Black Student Union to develop the program and consulting with them on Black studies faculty hires. CRES is also the first unit outside of the STEM fields to include a 4+1 pathway for students to earn an Education master&#8217;s degree and teaching credential.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 4+1 was realized at a time when Ethnic Studies has become a requirement at the high school level throughout the state,&#8221; said Hong. &#8220;We are positioning our students to have union-backed teaching jobs and to help roll out Ethnic Studies throughout the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hong also points to developments on the horizon: a Science and Justice minor, an ongoing collaboration with the Science and Justice Research Center and a creative CRES initiative pushed forward by faculty from a variety of artistic disciplines as a way to emphasize that art has always been an essential part of social and racial justice movements.</p>
<p>One of their instructors is micha c&#225;rdenas, an assistant professor of performance, play, and design as well as the director of the Critical Realities Studio, who taught a class on Trans of Color Media in winter quarter, which looked at the performance art and media art being created by trans people of color.</p>
<p>&#8220;The field of transgender studies has been evolving to think about the intersections of race and gender,&#8221; c&#225;rdenas said. &#8220;Studying Black women or Black women&#8217;s writing about their experience is one way of thinking about race and gender together. But thinking about transgender people of color is another way of thinking about how race and gender shape each other. They both influence each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the wake of national and global uprisings for racial justice following the police murder of George Floyd, the backlash has only made the department more committed to its work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Critical Ethnic Studies is constantly under attack,&#8221; said Taylor Ainslie, CRES department manager. &#8220;There are the overt attacks you&#8217;ll hear about from right wing media but there are also structural barriers that don&#8217;t look like an attack per se but nevertheless have a similar impact on our ability to survive as a department. It just gives us more reason to continue fighting.&#8221;<br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="af3484e38072704664be42b4189025e9"><name>advance-payment-suppliers-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Campus comment period for the Advanced Payment to Suppliers Policy</title><start-date>1652166000000</start-date><path>/2022/05/advance-payment-suppliers-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/05/advance-payment-suppliers-policy</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1652206896336</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1652222098879</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>&#160;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;The</span> <a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/policiesinreview/abusive_conduct_2022.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revised version</span></a><a href="https://wcms.ucsc.edu/renderfile/a79ceb1d8072704645e59c14c585598f/policies/policiesinreview/abusive_conduct_2022.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes the following key provisions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed policy affirms the University of California&#8217;s commitment to promoting and maintaining a healthy working and learning environment in which each individual is treated with respect.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#8220;Frequently Asked Questions&#8221; section of the proposed policy contains examples of what falls under the definition of abusive conduct and conduct that does not generally constitute abusive conduct.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed policy prohibits retaliation against any person who, in good faith, reports abusive conduct, assists someone with a report of abusive conduct, or participates in an investigation or other process under the policy.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed policy addresses free speech and academic freedom. The proposed policy is intended to protect members of the University community from abusive conduct, not to regulate protected speech. The proposed policy recognizes that freedom of speech and academic freedom are essential to the mission of the University. However, freedom of speech and academic freedom are not limitless and do not protect speech or expressive conduct that violates University policies when interpreted in light of free speech or academic freedom, or that violates federal law or state law.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed policy outlines the consequences of noncompliance, which include remediation, educational efforts, and/or employment consequences including informal counseling, adverse performance evaluations, corrective action/discipline, and termination.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are deeply troubled by the long-term ramifications for reproductive rights if the leaked draft U.S. Supreme Court opinion in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#8217;s Health Organization</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> becomes law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While only an initial draft opinion, the leaked document, if finalized and issued by the Court, would overturn the 1973 decision of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe v. Wade</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the 1992 decision of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planned Parenthood v. Casey </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">signaling a dramatic and deeply disappointing withdrawal of a right protected by the Constitution. Protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's right to privacy, pregnant people have had the right to reproductive decision-making for nearly fifty years. Many are rightfully troubled that this reversal may mean the Supreme Court will review&#8212;and potentially overturn&#8212;cases relying on similar reasoning that led the federal government to recognize other civil rights.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of California President Michael Drake announced on Monday that systemwide leaders will review the potential impacts on our community and operations, including health services, teaching, research, and public service missions. Similarly, campus leaders are evaluating how this possible reversal could impact our campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We support quality, affordable, and convenient health care for all people and are grateful that California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state leaders are working to protect reproductive rights in our state. UCSC Student Health Services continues to provide students with access to comprehensive reproductive health services and has long-standing referral relationships with community organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our country has made great strides over the past 50 years, yet as we are experiencing today, that progress is fragile and being threatened. We must all continue toward making a reality the more just and equitable future we can all envision and protect and advance human and civil rights for all people.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sincerely,&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Astronomy and astrophysics Ph.D. candidate Amanda Quirk came in second place in an elite group of ten competitors at the UC systemwide Grad Slam finale on May 6. She pulled off this impressive feat after </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/amanda-quirk-grad-slam-champion.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">winning the UCSC Grad Slam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March at the Kuumbwa jazz venue in downtown Santa Cruz, which came with a $3,000 prize.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first-place competitor was UC Berkeley student </span><a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/its-7th-year-grad-slam-delivers-promising-research-you-can-remember-and-explain#:&#126;:text=UC%20Berkeley%20graduate%20student%20Justin,from%20replicating%20inside%20the%20body."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin Lee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who gave a talk about an inhaled COVID-19 treatment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the finals, Quirk reprised her winning three-minute presentation in the finals, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Tale of Two Galaxies: Studying How Galaxies Change Over Time.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of contestants took part in the Grad Slam events that were held in the spring at the 10 UC campuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quirk celebrated her impressive showing this week.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I mostly entered Grad Slam because I thought it would be fun,&#8221; Quirk said. &#8220;I am graduating this year and am proud of all I've learned and accomplished, and of the people I have gotten the opportunity to work with. Grad Slam seemed like an awesome way to show that while challenging myself to learn how to communicate my work in an accessible way, which is important to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Quirk also sees the serious purpose behind Grad Slam: giving contenders great experience in communicating complex topics to a general audience that may lack intensive scientific training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I personally think that communication is the most important job of a scientist,&#8221; Quirk said. &#8220;We could discover something really cool, but it would mean nothing if we couldn't communicate it with anyone. I think scientists need to be able to tailor their explanations to their peers and to the general public.&#160; Both are just as important!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Science benefits so much from the public being interested, from inspiring the next generation to getting funding from the government or private sources. Communication is a skill that takes practice. I have been able to practice it most while teaching, but Grad Slam offered a new, and almost extreme, way to learn more about how to communicate science.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next stop for Quirk is Columbia University, where she earned her B.A. in astrophysics in 2017. She will be a teaching postdoc in astronomy for the next three years.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="be8968ea8072704664be42b4ffdcb956"><name>outstanding-staff-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Nominations for UC Santa Cruz's Outstanding Staff Award</title><summary>Please help us honor UC Santa Cruz's outstanding staff and make your nomination for the Outstanding Staff Award today.

Run 3 of the LHC will feature higher-energy particle beams and higher collision rates, allowing physicists to collect more data than in the previous two runs combined.</p>
<p>Based at CERN, the international particle physics lab in Geneva, Switzerland, the LHC has been in a long shutdown for maintenance and upgrades since December 2018. UC Santa Cruz physicists at the <a href="https://scipp.science.ucsc.edu/">Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP)</a> have been working on upgrades of the detector components in the ATLAS experiment, the largest of the particle detectors at the LHC.</p>
<p>Michael Hance, associate professor of physics at UCSC, will be the U.S. ATLAS physics support manager for Run 3.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run 3 is exciting for me not only because it will give us more data at higher collision energies, which we always love, but also because the detector is the best it&#8217;s ever been,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The collaboration has been busy improving all aspects of the experiment over the past few years, and we&#8217;ll be able to extract more information than ever out of the new data, on top of increasing the size of the dataset and the energy of the collisions. Putting all of those together gives us a really exciting opportunity to find new and unexpected things.&#8221;</p>
<p>UCSC physicists have been involved in the ATLAS project since the 1990s, said SCIPP Director Jason Nielsen. The detector has multiple layers of devices to track and measure the jets of subatomic particles generated by high-energy collisions of proton beams within the LHC. SCIPP&#8217;s work has focused on the two innermost tracking layers, including the silicon sensors and readout electronics.</p>
<p>&#8220;The detector we built is still in there, and it&#8217;s a bit of a challenge to keep everything going even as components get radiation damage,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have to make sure it&#8217;s still reading out signals and tracking particles accurately. At the same time, we&#8217;re also building the next-generation detector, which won&#8217;t be installed until the next shutdown in 2026.&#8221;</p>
<p>ATLAS is a general purpose detector designed to explore the widest possible range of physics phenomena. More than 5,500 scientists from 245 institutes in 42 countries work on the ATLAS experiment, investigating a variety of unanswered questions about the universe. In 2012, the ATLAS and CMS experiments confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson, which is crucial to understanding the origin of mass, and efforts continue to measure its properties with ever higher precision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited about getting Higgs measurements at high momentum, which opens up a new avenue where we may be able to sense the presence of new particles through indirect effects, even though we can&#8217;t see them directly,&#8221; Nielsen said.</p>
<p>Marco Battaglia, adjunct professor of physics, has driven much of the work at SCIPP on Higgs measurements at high momentum, not only in the ATLAS analysis but also in phenomenological studies with a team of theorists to provide tools for an optimal interpretation of past and future results.</p>
<p>&#8220;The anticipated Run 3 data will almost triple the total data set on which our analyses are based,&#8221; Battaglia said. &#8220;This is a major step forward, in particular for those studies probing the high energy frontier, such as new particle searches and, probably more importantly, measurements of Higgs boson properties that are basically limited by the number of available data events.&#8221;</p>
<p>Postdoctoral scholar Andrea Sciandra worked with Battaglia on new tracking algorithms that will improve the measurements of Higgs bosons, and he has been working in the ATLAS control room during start-up and commissioning for Run 3. Battaglia has also been responsible for tuning the ATLAS pixel detector readout to compensate for the radiation damage incurred during the previous runs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The emphasis on large data sets brings major challenges to mitigate the radiation damage effects on the detectors, in particular the silicon pixels installed closest to the colliding beams,&#8221; Battaglia said. &#8220;Run 3 is an important opportunity to develop procedures to operate these detectors in ways that minimize the impact of radiation damage effects on the ATLAS physics performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another area of research UCSC physicists are involved in is the search for new particles that could make up dark matter. Hance&#8217;s group is looking for &#8220;supersymmetric&#8221; particles, which are among the leading candidates for dark matter. &#8220;Our work will really benefit from the increased dataset as well as the detector improvements,&#8221; Hance said.</p>
<p>The UCSC ATLAS group includes nine senior physicists, along with many postdoctoral researchers and graduate students. Carolyn Gee is among the UCSC graduate students doing their thesis research at CERN. Gee worked during the shutdown to upgrade the semiconductor tracker control system in the ATLAS experimental cavern, and she developed new user interfaces for the control panel.</p>
<p>&#8220;CERN is emerging from its pandemic restrictions, which means that our students and postdocs are able to travel there to work on the experiment,&#8221; Hance said. &#8220;Spending time at CERN is a unique experience, one that several of our students have almost missed entirely during the pandemic. I can&#8217;t wait to see what they learn and accomplish while they&#8217;re there!&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cdec07d18072704664be42b4cc243446"><name>creative-economy-careers</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>A new class in the Arts Division aims to broaden students’ understanding of careers in the creative economy</title><summary>Careers in the Creative Economy, a first-time course in the UC Santa Cruz Division of the Arts, has been introducing students to a wide array of professionals in creative fields to help them explore and prepare for arts careers.</summary><start-date>1652684400000</start-date><path>/2022/05/creative-economy-careers</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/05/creative-economy-careers</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1652722239418</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1652722239418</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value><value>History of Art and Visual Culture</value><value>Theater Arts</value><value>Film and Digital Media</value><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value><value>Music</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Nina Sazevich</name><title></title><phone/><email>nina@sazevichpr.com</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/creative-economies.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/creative-economies.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>creative-economies.jpg</name><display-name>creative-economies.jpg</display-name><file-size>42346</file-size><width>872</width><height>490</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/creative-economies-thumb.png</path><link>site://news/2022/creative-economies-thumb.png</link><site>news</site><name>creative-economies-thumb.png</name><display-name>creative-economies-thumb.png</display-name><file-size>14757</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juan Morales-Rocha, a recent UCSC grad and Design Analyst at Xbox Game Studios Publishing, spoke with students of the new course, Careers in the Creative Economy.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A first-time course in the UC Santa Cruz Division of the Arts has been introducing students to a wide array of professionals in creative fields to help them explore and prepare for arts careers. Entitled Careers in the Creative Economy, the class launched this spring as part of a number of campus initiatives funded by a grant to UCSC&#8217;s </span><a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/about/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hispanic-Serving Institution Initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the U.S. Department of Education, </span><a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/hsi-grants/ganas-ppoha.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graduating and Advancing New American Scholars: Promoting Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans (GANAS PPOHA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taught by Lecturer Shelby Graham, who served for many years as Director and Curator of UCSC&#8217;s Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery, Careers in the Creative Economy provides students from across the Arts Division with information, tools, and strategies to consider as they contemplate working in the arts, including strategies for addressing challenges and opportunities related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 23 enrolled students, who are all either first generation college and/or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIPOC including Latinx</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have been exploring their career values; preparing and creating career-related documents; and learning about a variety of arts careers through a series of guest speakers who hold these same identities and have navigated a diverse array of creative fields.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was so excited to be able to talk about jobs in this course!&#8221; says Graham. &#8220;There are many creative career possibilities out there, not just &#8216;I need to get discovered.&#8217; It&#8217;s important to show young people that there are really interesting projects they can do at entry level jobs and internships&#8212;that there are opportunities to support themselves while they work towards a career.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, Graham enlisted a number of recent graduates as guest speakers including Juan Morales-Rocha, who has a B.A. in Art &amp; Design: Games + Playable Media and a B.S. in Cognitive Science: Artificial Intelligence/Human-Computer Interaction from UCSC. Rocha, currently working as a Design Analyst at Xbox Game Studios Publishing and who runs an indie game studio called</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">No Static Games</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was a hit with the students when he spoke with them in early May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What struck me about Juan Morales-Rocha was how similar he is to me,&#8221; says Film &amp; Digital Media student Justin &#8220;JJ&#8221; Hamm. &#8220;It&#8217;s a joy to see someone who likes the same things as I do working in the creative economy and thriving."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He changed his major to Cognitive Science which is still related to what he wanted to do, just from a different perspective,&#8221; says fellow Film &amp; Digital Media major Chenguang Wang. &#8220;So, I think one thing that&#8217;s really important is to open up your mind, try to see things from different perspectives.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other guests speakers have included Eric Rosales, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feature Film Department Manager at Pixar Animation Studios who has a BA</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Film and Digital Media from UCSC; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina Garcia Weiland, a Lead Technical Director in Sets at Pixar Animation Studios; George Luna-Pe&#241;a, Program Director of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity Apprenticeship Program (DAP) at The Broad in Los Angeles; Betty Avila with Self Help Graphics in Los Angeles; Ela Troyano and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krista Fabian DeCastro of Creative Capital; and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">award-winning director, editor and cinematographer Melissa Lesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wide range of guests has made an impression on the participating students. "The field of the creative economy is way larger and even more abundant than what I thought it would be after taking this class,&#8221; says Wang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Art major Katana Parker, the visit with the professionals from Creative Capital was particularly illuminating. &#8220;It was good to hear about applying for grants since I hadn&#8217;t really thought a lot about them at all. It&#8217;s reassuring to know there are many different people and groups out there that are interested in helping artists," he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Graham, the course has formalized something she had been acting on for years as UCSC&#8217;s Gallery Director. &#8220;I was always helping students get internships in interesting places, writing letters of recommendation, and helping them think about how to find work in the arts,&#8221; she says. &#8220;There are many pathways after art school. This course really opens the doors.&#8221;</span></p>

A seed grant from the state-funded <a href="https://calearninglab.org/"><span class="s2">California Learning Lab</span></a> will be used to help address this equity gap in calculus courses and increase retention for engineering students at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Teaching professors Frank B&#228;uerle and Pedro Morales-Almazan (Department of Mathematics, division of Physical and Biological Sciences), will collaborate with Associate Professor Marcella Gomez (Department of Applied Mathematics, Baskin School of Engineering) to add context for engineering applications of calculus into the curriculum of Math 19A (Calculus for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics), a course required for engineering, math, and physics students typically taken in a student&#8217;s first year.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They will incorporate related elements of active learning into discussion sections through an equal partnership with <a href="https://ace.science.ucsc.edu/#:&#126;:text=What%20is%20ACE%3F,Learn%20more"><span class="s2">Academic Excellence (ACE)</span></a> program&#8217;s director Susanna Honig and Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (CITL) director Jody Greene, who have deep expertise in evidence-based pedagogy.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;As instructors, our goal should be to level the playing field and ensure that all students have equal access to progress and continue on to a major of their choice,&#8221; Gomez said. &#8220;[These changes will] establish that expectation that we&#8217;re fully confident that they are continuing in the STEM major and as such we're preparing them.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The faculty hope to make the calculus class better facilitate learning preparation for engineering courses by mapping what they're learning in lecture to content that might appear in later classes. Additionally, they will work with ACE staff to create materials and projects that encourage active learning and figure out which techniques will best support student success. ACE learning skills advisors, who have experience with the pedagogy, content, and faculty of these classes, will work with graduate student teaching assistants to augment the instruction provided in discussion sections.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Providing opportunities to engage and using tools that we know can have a positive impact makes a lot of sense,&#8221; B&#228;uerle said. &#8220;There's science behind it, there's pedagogy behind it that makes it clear that this is a proven strategy.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By increasing skills and confidence in these calculus courses, Gomez says that students can build their own scientific identity and develop a sense of belonging in the engineering disciplines, which is essential for long-term success.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;[We want] them to feel like they're not just a daughter or a sister, but they&#8217;re also a scientist, they're also an engineer,&#8221; Gomez said.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The California Learning Lab, which provided the $100,000 grant, is funding an initiative to address the calculus equity gap in the state's UCs, state universities, and community colleges. The materials created by researchers at UCSC will be open source for other educators to learn from for their own classes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is one of several efforts on campus to rethink math courses with student success in mind. B&#228;uerle hopes that this project can assist in the process of ensuring that calculus courses offered at UCSC are suiting the needs of engineering students as well as students across the campus for which calculus plays a foundational role in their fields.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;This project is exciting because it's combining proven strategies to help support student learning and establish collaboration with faculty from engineering,&#8221; B&#228;uerle said. &#8220;We hope we can use this project as a model for adding contextualized examples for engineering and other subjects as well as ACE-integration to other courses.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ce2905e68072704664be42b4d0acaae7"><name>karl-pister-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Former UCSC Chancellor Karl S.

Pister, who devoted more than 70 years to the University of California, to higher education, and to expanding educational opportunities for students from kindergarten to graduate school, died on Saturday, May 14, at his home in Walnut Creek. He was 96 years old.</p>
<p>Pister had a remarkable career in higher education, starting as a structural engineering professor and dean of engineering at UC Berkeley and rising to UC Santa Cruz chancellor and UC vice president. Well into his 80s, he continued work that guided the direction of education and science, particularly in California.</p>
<p>&#8220;Karl was the quintessential academic leader. In each role he undertook, he significantly strengthened the University of California,&#8221; said UC President Michael V. Drake, MD. &#8220;His work has had a lasting impact in California and across the country, as well as on many generations of UC students and alumni. He was a wonderful and wise teacher, mentor, supporter, and kind friend to me and many others fortunate enough to know him over his long and distinguished career. He will be missed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pister was a champion of broad and fair access to the University of California and a staunch advocate for ensuring that all qualified students had the chance for a UC education. After the 1996 passage of California&#8217;s Proposition 209&#8212;which prohibited state institutions from considering race, sex or ethnicity in admissions and hiring&#8212;his was a strong voice in assuring that the university maintain vigorous outreach programs to California&#8217;s underrepresented students.</p>
<p>He was also known as a catalyst for collaboration, growing creative partnerships among disciplines, educational institutions, government, industry, and communities to advance education at all levels.</p>
<p>As chancellor of UC Santa Cruz from 1991 to 1996, Pister embraced the experimental tradition of UC Santa Cruz and its strong undergraduate teaching, while working to strengthen its foundations, research enterprise, and growth. He steered the campus through the dramatic cuts in state funding for UC, oversaw a 30% increase in research funding, established clearly defined parameters for the development and protection of campus land, and significantly improved town-gown cooperation.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Karl became chancellor in 1991, it was a turbulent time for our campus,&#8221; said current UC Santa Cruz chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;State budget cuts were looming, there were protests over land use, tense relations with the city, and consensus on campus seemed out of reach. Karl&#8217;s leadership brought us through, with his signature commitment to transparency, working together, and the kind of problem-solving that defines an exceptional engineer. He made a difference on our campus that endures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pister joined other UC chancellors in 1995 in issuing a unanimous public statement imploring the UC Regents to reverse their stance against affirmative action in admissions, and he led UC Santa Cruz in deepening outreach efforts. He founded the campus&#8217;s Leadership Opportunity Awards, now named in his honor, that help outstanding but low-income students from 13 community colleges make the jump to earn their degrees at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In 2000, Pister became the University of California&#8217;s first Vice President for Educational Outreach, leading UC efforts to improve education for underrepresented students in California. Under his direction, the university developed perhaps the most comprehensive network of school-university collaborations in the nation, working with many low-performing schools to improve outcomes. Owing much to his advocacy, the state budget for this work grew, and the university also expanded its role in educating K-12 teachers and addressing the shortage of school principals.</p>
<h2>A child of Stockton school teachers</h2>
<p>Karl Stark Pister was born in Stockton, Calif., the son of two high school teachers. He and his younger brother, Phil, had the run of 320 acres and a house his family had owned since the mid-1800s. He was valedictorian of his high school class, but entering UC Berkeley as a civil engineering student threw him a significant curve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t educationally disadvantaged. It was cultural shock,&#8221; he said, according to an interview published in California magazine in 2006 when he was named UC Berkeley Alumnus of the Year. He said the experience informed his work with students throughout his life, and led to his fierce advocacy for assisting first-generation and underrepresented students on their path to a college degree.</p>
<p>Pister earned his B.S. in civil engineering at Berkeley in 1945, interrupting his studies for service in the Navy during the final year of World War II, when he served at Okinawa, Japan. He returned for a master&#8217;s degree at Berkeley, where he met Rita Olsen, a fellow student who was working on a teaching certificate, at a dance in Hearst Gymnasium. They were married in 1950 in Oakland and moved to Illinois for Pister&#8217;s doctoral studies at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.</p>
<p>After Pister earned his Ph.D. in theoretical and applied mechanics in 1952, the couple returned to California. They settled in Lafayette, where they raised their six children, two sons and four daughters.</p>
<p>That same year, he joined the faculty in civil engineering at Berkeley. He became an international authority on structural mechanics and earthquake engineering, a founding father of the field of computational mechanics, and a pioneer in using computers to analyze the design of buildings, bridges, and other structures.</p>
<p>Coupled with his teaching and research, he emerged as a campus leader, including chairing the nine-campus Academic Council of the UC Academic Senate in the late 1970s and serving as the faculty representative to the UC Board of Regents.</p>
<p>Pister&#8217;s institutional leadership led to his selection as dean of the College of Engineering at Berkeley in 1980. He became a leading voice nationally in issues in engineering education and in shaping science and technology policy at the federal and state levels. As dean, he led Berkeley&#8217;s top-ranked engineering programs through a period of tremendous evolution, weathering the challenges posed by diminishing state budgets for the university.</p>
<p>In 1991, UC president David P. Gardner enlisted the help of his legendary predecessor, Clark Kerr, to recruit Pister as UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s sixth chancellor. Pister signed on in August 1991 for a two-year term as interim chancellor. Within seven months, the faculty, once doubters, successfully lobbied UC leaders to erase &#8220;interim&#8221; from his title. He went on to serve a full five-year term as chancellor.</p>
<p>Pister&#8217;s work on the central coast was not limited to the Santa Cruz campus. He contributed to the conversion of Fort Ord into the California State University, Monterey Bay campus, co-founded a consortium of partnerships between UC Santa Cruz and local K-12 schools, and worked with the Monterey Bay Aquarium to develop research in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.</p>
<p>After his chancellorship, Pister continued to focus on equal access to education at the UC president&#8217;s office from 1996 to 2000. He created and led the new UC Office of Educational Outreach devoted to these efforts, earning accolades for its success.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, he held a dizzying array of positions aimed at strengthening education, including chair of the California Council for Science and Technology, director of UC Berkeley&#8217;s Center for Studies in Higher Education, founding chair of the Board on Engineering Education of the National Research Council, and board member of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, the Center for the Future of Teaching and Learning, and the Monterey Institute of International Studies. He was also a founding trustee and corporate treasurer of the American University of Armenia.</p>
<p>A lifelong Catholic, Pister was also active in church and ecumenical activities, including service as a member of the board of the Graduate Theological Union, a multi-denominational Berkeley consortium of seminaries and centers for theological studies. He was also a Regent of Berkeley&#8217;s Franciscan School of Theology, which awarded him an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.</p>
<p>Pister&#8217;s list of honors is vast. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the highest professional honor for a U.S. engineer, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. For extraordinary contributions to the University of California and higher education, he received UC&#8217;s Presidential Medal, Clark Kerr Award, Berkeley Medal and Berkeley Citation. The American Society for Engineering Education gave him its highest awards for contributions to engineering education and advancing minorities in engineering. He was twice selected as a Fulbright Scholar, and he won a raft of honors from national engineering societies.</p>
<p>Pister&#8217;s wife of 60 years, Rita, passed away in 2011. He is survived by their six children&#8212;Karl Francis Pister (Roger Renn) of Concord; Tracy Pearse Mulder of Stockton; Anita Pister-Khus of Concord; Jacinta Pister (Richard Whitmore) of Lafayette; Claire Brouwer (Kurt) of Waikoloa Village, Hawaii; and Kristofer Pister (Jennifer) of Orinda&#8212;10 grandchildren, Sarena, Brendan (Lexy), Stark, Ann, Nathaniel, Kaiser (Mary Kate), Elijah, Marie, Veronika, and Luke; his great grandson, Maverick; his brother, Phil Pister of Bishop, Calif.; and his dear friend and partner, Germaine LaBerge of Berkeley.</p>
<p>The family is planning a private funeral. A public memorial service will be held at a date to be announced later.</p>
<p>In lieu of flowers, gifts in his memory may be made to either the Karl S. and Rita Olsen Pister Graduate Fellowship Fund at UC Berkeley (UC Berkeley Foundation, 1995 University Ave., Suite 400, Berkeley, CA 94704-1070) or to the Rita Olsen Pister Scholarship Fund at UC Santa Cruz (giving.ucsc.edu or UC Santa Cruz Foundation, 1156 High St., Santa Cruz, CA 95064).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ce8a65528072704664be42b410025cbc"><name>nasa-astronauts</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Talk by NASA astronauts canceled</title><summary>Due to unforeseen circumstances and mission priorities at NASA, the astronauts will not be able to travel to Santa Cruz next week.

The planned events on campus have been postponed indefinitely.</em></p>
<p>NASA astronauts Michael S. Hopkins (Colonel, U.S. Space Force) and Victor J. Glover, Jr. (Captain, U.S. Navy) will visit UC Santa Cruz in May for a series of events with students, including a public talk.</p>
<p>The presentation by Hopkins and Glover&#8212;<strong>&#8220;Taking flight together: The role of teamwork on the International Space Station&#8221;</strong>&#8212;will take place at the Stevenson Event Center on the UCSC campus on Thursday, May 26, at 10 a.m. The event is free and open to the entire student body and the public. Advance registration is required to attend. To register and to submit questions for the astronauts, visit <a href="https://goslugs.com/sports/2022/4/25/astroslugs.aspx">goslugs.com/Astroslugs</a>.</p>
<p>Hopkins and Glover both served on the first post-certification mission (Crew-1) of the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft&#8212;Hopkins as commander and Glover as pilot and second-in-command&#8212;on a long-duration mission (Expedition 64) to the International Space Station (ISS). They spent a total of 168 days in space and participated in multiple spacewalks (four by Glover and five by Hopkins). Crew-1 broke the U.S. crewed spacecraft mission duration record set by the final Skylab crew in 1974, returning on May 2, 2021, in the first nighttime splashdown for NASA astronauts since Apollo 8 in 1968.</p>
<p>During their visit to UC Santa Cruz, the astronauts will engage with students in several groups, including discussions with student athletes and with students in astronomy, physics, and other STEM disciplines, as well as a conversation with faculty, staff, and students about diversity, equity, and inclusion in the STEM disciplines and the NASA space program.</p>
<p>The astronauts were invited to UCSC by Dino Pollock, senior associate director of athletics, and J. Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and the faculty athletics representative. Pollock and Hopkins were football teammates at the University of Illinois, and Prochaska and Glover were also student athletes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We designed the visit to explore the value and intersectionality of the STEM disciplines, intercollegiate athletics, and issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion,&#8221; Pollock said.</p>
<p>The lead sponsors of the events are the UCSC Department of Athletics and Recreation and the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, in collaboration with the Baskin School of Engineering, Ethnic Resource Centers, and the Chancellor&#8217;s Office.</p>

The person who committed this crime admitted to doing so out of racism, white supremacy, and emulation of other appalling hate crimes.</p>
<p>Our hearts go out to the Buffalo community, to the victims and their families, and to our campus community who mourn this weekend&#8217;s senseless tragedy. Anti-Blackness, white supremacy, and conspiratorial theories that inspire violence should be condemned completely, and we join the many voices today doing so.</p>
<p>We must continue the meaningful work of understanding the structures and power dynamics of racial inequality that reveals the hollowness of conspiracy theories and the inhumanity and hatred that motivates them. We must also continue to make our own campus a welcoming place where all students, faculty and staff are able to thrive.</p>

The three-minute research video, titled &#8220;<a href="https://stemforall2022.videohall.com/presentations/2274">Learning by Observing and Pitching In</a>,&#8221; features an inspiring collaborative process in which children learn skills and community-mindedness as they are immersed in shared endeavors with people of all ages, contributing with initiative to foster group goals and harmony.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video production, led by Barbara Rogoff, Distinguished Professor of Psychology at UC Santa Cruz, involved an international team of UCSC-trained doctoral students and graduates, including Andrew Dayton, Dr. Itzel Aceves-Azuara, Dr. Rebeca Mej&#237;a-Arauz, Dr. Luc&#237;a Alcal&#225;, Dr. Andrew Coppens, Dr. Ang&#233;lica L&#243;pez-Fraire, and Claudia Casta&#241;eda.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers submitted the video as part of NSF&#8217;s annual video competition, which showcases innovative ways to improve learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Understanding ways that learning is organized in different communities can provide insights and inspire innovations that provide broader opportunities for all children to learn,&#8221; Rogoff said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These insights can aid national efforts to broaden children&#8217;s participation in science, engineering, and other academic fields, according to the researchers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rogoff&#8217;s video is available for voting through May 17 at NSF&#8217;s <a href="https://stemforall2022.videohall.com/presentations/2274">competition website</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Viewers are invited to vote for their favorite videos and join online discussion about the research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Videos from Rogoff&#8217;s research team have taken top awards in the previous six years. The prior videos&#8212;about skilled collaboration, helpfulness, learning with purpose, and keen observation&#8212;remain available for <a href="https://multiplex.videohall.com/">viewing online</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now in its eighth year, the 2022 NSF STEM For All Video Showcase features over 260 innovative projects aimed at improving STEM learning and teaching.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Santa Cruz County Elections Department will have the Votemobile trailer at the main entrance of campus where you may&#160; also register to vote prior to the primary election. The Votemobile trailer will be at the the Barn Theatre (Parking Lot 122) at the base of campus on the following two Fridays:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday, May 20 from&#160; 8 a.m. to noon </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday, May 27 from noon to 4 p.m.&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><i>I don&#8217;t know where I am registered, can I look it up online</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. You can go to </span><a href="https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoterStatus.sos.ca.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and look up your voter information. If you need to change anything, you can go to RegisterToVote.ca.gov and change it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Registered to vote back home?</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are registered at an address that is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Santa Cruz County, a ballot would have been mailed to that address. If you did not receive a ballot, you will need to visit one of the in-person voting sites, like the Stevenson Event Center on campus, to fill out the conditional voting registration.&#160;</span></p>

<p>The ride will begin at Porter and Kresge colleges and make its way through campus before ending in downtown Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Started in 2012 by Mark Hawwa in Sydney, Australia, the themed ride has brought together over 2,500 riders across 64 cities, and with its success, Hawwa saw how it could be used to support a worthy cause. Since 2016, The DGR has partnered with Movember, and through its foundation, they both support a common goal: bring people together and raise awareness of men&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>Dapper-dressed motorcyclists ride vintage-inspired motorcycles around the globe on May 22 to raise funds for cutting-edge research in prostate cancer, and life-saving mental health, and suicide prevention programs. The Distinguished Gentleman&#8217;s Ride is opened to all genders, cultures and sexes. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cf4e64688072704664be42b4a054232e"><name>welcome-vice-chancellor-student-affairs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Welcoming our new Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success</title><summary>I am happy to announce that Akirah J.

Bradley-Armstrong, our new Vice Chancellor for the Division of Student Affairs and Success, has officially joined us.</p>
<p>Akirah will be a powerful advocate for our students and a great addition to our campus community, as she arrives with nearly 20 years of experience as a student affairs professional, most recently as Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is an accomplished leader who has demonstrated vision and dynamic leadership focused on supporting student belonging, engagement, health, wellness, and much more. She has also worked closely with student leadership to support student needs and priorities, and to ensure student perspectives are understood and considered across campus.</p>
<p>Her professional background makes her a strong fit for our campus. Akirah joined Boulder in 2016 as dean of students and associate vice chancellor. In that role she created a new social justice residence hall, a summer bridge program for veterans, and a student engagement and response team to help students successfully exercise their free speech rights. She worked at UC Berkeley from 2008 to 2016, starting as an academic programs coordinator in the Early Academic Outreach Program before serving as an academic specialist in the Office of Student Development. In 2011 she was named assistant dean of students.</p>
<p>Akirah holds a doctorate of education in educational leadership from UC Davis; a master of education in higher education and student affairs administration from the University of Vermont; and a bachelor of science in business administration from Mansfield University.</p>
<p>My sincere thanks to Jennifer Baszile, who has capably served as the vice chancellor on an interim basis for nearly two years. She is now the Associate Chancellor for Strategic Initiatives and Educational Partnerships, a role in which she will continue to advance equity in student success on our campus and forge collaborative partnerships with other institutions of higher education.</p>
<p>Our campus has weathered a challenging past two years, but our work together during this time has laid the foundation for a bright future for UC Santa Cruz. We have made progress on our shared goals of improving student success; elevating our research impact; fostering a more inclusive campus community; and increasing the efficiency, effectiveness and resilience of our campus. Akirah&#8217;s arrival makes us even stronger. Please join me in offering her a warm welcome!</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d0b0e60e8072704664be42b40de239c4"><name>entrepreneurial-day</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Father of Modern Entrepreneurship to speak during inaugural Entrepreneurial Day at UCSC</title><summary>The first annual Entrepreneurial Day at UC Santa Cruz will take place Saturday, May 21.

As the featured speaker for the first annual Entrepreneurial Day at UCSC, Steve Blank will host a fireside chat this Saturday, May 21 at noon in the Merrill Cultural Center. During the chat, Blank will engage with students, staff, and faculty about what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur. He will share his own experiences&#8211;and success&#8211;as an innovator, business person, author, and educator.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credited with launching the Lean Startup movement and the curriculums for the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps and Hacking for Defense and Diplomacy, Blank changed how startups are built; how entrepreneurship is taught; how science is commercialized, and how companies and the government innovate. Given these industry-leading accomplishments, Steve is often described as the Father of Modern Entrepreneurship.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Blank is an adjunct professor at Stanford and co-founder of the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation. He</span>&#160;is also the author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Four Steps to the Epiphany</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Startup Owner&#8217;s Manual</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which revolutionized how startups are built. His Harvard Business Review cover story redefined how large companies can innovate at speed.&#160;<span>&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Blank's talk, there will be a resource fair and networking event with clubs from around campus. Students will have the opportunity to connect with their peers and build upon the entrepreneurial lessons learned during the fireside chat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s inaugural Entrepreneurial Day at UCSC caps a series of Entrepreneurship Month events sponsored by <a href="https://sua.ucsc.edu/">Student Union Assembly (SUA)</a>, <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/work/pit-un/programs-ucsc/cied/">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development (CIED)</a>, the <a href="https://innovation.ucsc.edu/">Innovation and Business Engagement Hub</a>, and <a href="https://www.scee.ucsc.edu/">Student Creativity and Entrepreneurial Empowerment (SCEE)</a>. The month-long programming effort started April 14 with a guest lecture by Toby Corey. Since then, students have had the opportunity to participate in Lean Startup BootCamp, attend a guest lecture about Marketing by Rick Vargas, and pitch their own business ideas at SlugTank.&#160;</span></p>

Hired following a national search that spanned fall and winter quarters,&#160;Ebon&#233;e will report to the vice chancellor for student affairs and success. She will serve as a key member of the division&#8217;s cabinet and leadership teams and will advise the vice chancellor and campus leadership on matters of student success, equity, retention, climate, and belonging.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The associate vice chancellor for student success and equity plays an essential role in student success program implementation, and Ebon&#233;e will work to align a substantial portfolio of academic and non-academic programs and initiatives to help achieve key campus goals. Ebon&#233;e&#8217;s experience as an engineer, lecturer, and student affairs professional will be instrumental to developing campus partnerships in support of student success, particularly as it relates to retention of underrepresented students. Called upon to lead multi-divisional, multi-functional, teams, Ebon&#233;e will partner with faculty and student affairs practitioners in our shared pursuit: success and equity for all students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ebon&#233;e brings unique skill sets and perspectives to the campus and both have made her a transformational leader. A first-generation college student, she earned a PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Washington, a master of science in industrial business management from the Lille Business School, and a bachelor of science in chemical engineering from Brown University. In 2015, she earned a professional performance coaching certificate. Last year, she completed the UC Executive Leadership Academy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already familiar with the UC system, Ebon&#233;e comes to UC Santa Cruz from UC San Diego. There she held a number of roles, including director of the Gordon Engineering Leadership Center (2009-2019) and interim assistant vice chancellor of student retention and success (2019-2020). Most recently, Ebon&#233;e served on the student affairs leadership team as the director of virtual experience and peer engagement initiatives. She did most of this while teaching in multiple engineering departments as part of a lecturer appointment (2006-2020).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are so excited to bring Ebon&#233;e to the campus in the role of associate vice chancellor for student success and equity,&#8221; shared Jody Green, co-chair of the search committee and special advisor to the campus provost and executive vice chancellor for educational equity and academic success. &#8220;Her presence in this critical role will allow us to develop a comprehensive strategic vision that coordinates the efforts of staff and faculty in support of student success and educational equity. Ebon&#233;e&#8217;s deep and varied experience at UC San Diego ranges from classroom instruction to leadership development to retention and student engagement. I&#8217;m greatly looking forward to collaborating with and learning from Ebon&#233;e in her new role.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ebon&#233;e attributes her creative, intentional, and effective leadership as a student affairs professional to the system and design thinking skills she gained as a chemical engineer. Similarly, as with engineering, she believes co-curricular experiential learning is essential to student success. She aspires to cultivate learning environments that ensure students develop a deeper understanding of themselves and a greater resolve to navigate the world around them. With this goal in mind, Ebon&#233;e is particularly excited to support and elevate the work of those reporting to her. Student-centered and results-oriented, she is committed to working across disciplines to create opportunities, bolster support, and improve retention for underrepresented students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akirah Bradley-Armstrong, the new vice chancellor for student affairs and success, shared her enthusiasm for all Ebon&#233;e will bring to UC Santa Cruz, &#8220;I am looking forward to Ebon&#233;e&#8217;s leadership and partnering with her to uplift and center student success and equity. Ebon&#233;e&#8217;s talents in bringing people together and cultivating spaces that create community and sense of belonging for students will make a significant impact for students.&#8221;</span></p>

Pister, who devoted a remarkable 70 years to the University of California and to expanding educational opportunities for students, died Saturday, May 14, at his home in Walnut Creek. He was 96.</p>
<p>Chancellor Pister, who led UCSC from 1991 to 1996, embraced his time in Santa Cruz, arriving here after nearly 40 years as a structural engineering professor at UC Berkeley, with time as Berkeley&#8217;s dean of engineering. The 1990s were a turbulent time for our campus. State budget cuts were looming, there were protests over land use, tense relations with the city, and consensus on campus seemed out of reach. Chancellor Pister&#8217;s leadership brought us through. He demonstrated a commitment to transparency, working together, and the kind of problem-solving that defines an exceptional engineer. He made a difference on our campus that endures to this day.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Chancellor Pister championed broad and equitable access to the University of California. After the 1996 passage of Proposition 209, which prohibited California institutions from considering race, sex or ethnicity in admissions and hiring, he led UCSC in deeping outreach programs to California&#8217;s underrepresented students. He also founded our Leadership Opportunity Awards, now rightfully named in his honor, that help outstanding low-income students from 13 community colleges make the jump to earn their degrees at UC Santa Cruz. To date, our campus has had a remarkable 326 Pister scholars, with another dozen or so coming this next academic year. What an incredible legacy.</p>
<p>I did not know Chancellor Pister personally, but he reached out after my arrival to campus to offer his best wishes and support. I greatly appreciated his kindness and generous nature.</p>
<p>Please join me in taking a moment to recognize Chancellor Pister&#8217;s contributions to campus, which are detailed in a <a

astrophysics</article-subhead><article-text>Amanda Quirk caught a glimpse of the future by looking into the past. <br/><br/>The 27-year-old from Alpharetta, Ga., who completed her doctoral studies in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz this year, has spent the last five years studying something called galactic cannibalism or galaxy mergers, which is what happens when two galaxies collide. <br/><br/>Sometimes, when the crash involves spiral galaxies like those Quirk studied, one of these beautiful but fragile star systems will be torn to shreds. Other times, one of the galaxies will swallow the other. Peering deep into space using one of the world&#8217;s largest telescopes, Quirk measured the difference between how fast old and new stars moved in two relatively nearby galaxies, Andromeda and the smaller Triangulum. Differences in the velocity of these old and new stars are an indication of changes the galaxy may have undergone. Quirk&#8217;s research showed evidence that Andromeda had some kind of major galactic collision in the past 4 billion years. And, most importantly, survived.<br/><br/>&#8220;Just seeing that it is perhaps possible for Andromeda to survive a merger tells us, in general, about the kinds of mergers spiral galaxies might be able to endure,&#8221; said Quirk, who received a prestigious National Science Foundation grad research grant to support her work.<br/><br/>All of which has implications for our own galaxy, the Milky Way, which is on a collision course with the Andromeda galaxy billions of years from now.<br/><br/>With three papers already published in respected journals, Quirk will now head to Columbia University for a postdoc position teaching science&#8212;a calling evidenced by her first-place finish in this year&#8217;s UCSC Grad Slam competition followed by her second-place finish in the wider UC Grad Slam, in which researchers must explain the entirety of their work in a three-minute elevator pitch any layperson can understand. <br/><br/>That ability to explain difficult concepts in exciting and easy-to-understand ways was enhanced, according to Quirk, through the campus&#8217;s Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning. In addition, she was able to put those same skills to use by being a mentor in a course titled Introduction to Research (AY9) in the Astronomy Department. The two-quarter class was designed to help first-year and transfer students learn the fundamentals of research, from how to code to how to read and write research papers. She also mentored high school students interested in astronomy as part of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s eight-week Science Internship Program.<br/><br/>&#8220;To interact with undergrad and high school students who cared about science and astronomy and were excited about it, was wonderful,&#8221; she said.<br/><br/>Quirk also formed a support group for disabled grad students while serving as a grad student assistant in the Disability Resource Center on campus. While the pandemic quashed the program after a short time, it &#8220;was cathartic to hear I wasn&#8217;t alone,&#8221; Quirk said. <br/><br/>&#8220;Amanda is a brilliant scientist, creative thinker, passionate mentor, and articulate communicator,&#8221; said Professor Raja GuhaThakurta, chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. &#8220;I have learned a tremendous amount from her spirit of perseverance against odds, tremendous empathy, and a desire to make the world a better place.&#8221;<br/><br/>Quirk, meanwhile, will continue to explore galaxies, driven by her quest for knowledge and the chance to see our own place, not only in the world but in the universe. <br/><br/>&#8220;Seeing how small each individual human is in the universe reminds me to be more patient, to not sweat the small stuff or things that are out of my control,&#8221; Quirk said. &#8220;Space exists beyond us and it will exist after us, and I find that knowledge kind of freeing. It gives me peace.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d44026b88072704664be42b43cbd0d58"><name>rugby-alumni</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Stories of UCSC rugby: Leslie Riehl and Pam Krone, the first women on the team</title><summary>Alumni Leslie Riehl (Cowell ’78, Mathematics) and Pam Krone (Cowell ’75) were the only women on UCSC’s rugby club in 1974, making their stand as women in the sport years before the women’s rugby club formed in 1979. &#13;

The reunion will honor the legacy of the women&#8217;s rugby team from 2006 to 2013, who were competitively successful year after year. In addition, a banner commemorating the 2006 women&#8217;s national championship team will be hung on the athletics and recreation field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s rugby club was formed in 1967, two years after the opening of the campus. It is one of&#8212;if not the&#8212;longest-standing sports clubs in campus history and has taken on many different forms.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The club was formed by Duncan Graham and Dan Porter, and coached by physics professor Ron Ruby.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 1974, Dan Porter was coaching a team of about 30 men and two women. The two women on the team&#8212;Leslie Riehl </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Cowell &#8217;78, Mathematics) </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Pam Krone </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Cowell &#8217;75)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;are known as legends in the UCSC rugby community, making their stand as women in the sport years before the women&#8217;s rugby club formed in 1979.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Sit, the 2006 women&#8217;s rugby captain, is thrilled to meet Riehl and Krone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to meet them,&#8221; Sit said. &#8220;I hear their stories, and it&#8217;s almost like an urban legend. I&#8217;m so excited to meet them.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Leslie Riehl and Pam Krone&#160;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For alumna Leslie Riehl (known to her classmates as Leslie Hoffman), seeing the UCSC rugby club running drills on the field was familiar. She went to boarding school in England and was accustomed to the sport. When she joined UCSC&#8217;s rugby club, she expected to join a women&#8217;s team, but instead found herself in a tackle sport surrounded by men twice her size.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t just that UC Santa Cruz did not have a women&#8217;s rugby team, but that women&#8217;s collegiate rugby was a fresh concept in the United States. </span><a href="https://www.uswrf.org/post/a-brief-history-of-the-first-women-s-collegiate-championships"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 1974</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, less than 20 university women&#8217;s rugby teams had formed in the U.S..&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, Porter and the roughly 30 men that made up the team in 1974 urged Riehl and Krone to keep coming back.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From the minute you got there, everybody was happy,&#8221; Riehl said. &#8220;They wanted you to come back, they wanted you to play, and they wanted you to play well. There was never a moment when I felt they wanted me to fail or leave. I just felt like I was one of the members of the team.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riehl played rugby for her first and second years at UCSC but left to focus on her studies in her latter years at the university. Krone played on the team for one year before transferring to Stanford University in her third year. Both women said that the years they spent with the rugby club were filled with immeasurable fun.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Riehl, Krone had not seen rugby before and was unfamiliar with the sport. Her first interaction with the team was a game of flag rugby where players pull flags attached to their waists to signify a tackle rather than physically tackling the player. It wasn&#8217;t until Krone&#8217;s first couple of practices that she realized the type of tackle sport she had gotten herself into.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were playing scrimmages and tackling each other, and that was about the time I learned that it was a tackle sport&#8212;but by that time, I was hooked,&#8221; Krone said. &#8220;It was just so much fun, and I loved the game. I loved running around, and I really enjoyed the people that were playing. So I said, &#8216;well, I&#8217;ll just do it.&#8217;&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Riehl and Krone played the hooker position and were routinely swapped out during games. Riehl was known for her strength, while Krone for her speed. The UCSC rugby club played against the likes of Stanford, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and others.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One game, in particular, stood out amongst the rest in 1974&#8212; the Stanford 10s tournament. For the first time that season, a team refused to play against UCSC because women were on the team.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That was the only game where somebody made an issue of it,&#8221; Krone recalled. &#8220;Basically, they just said, &#8216;we don&#8217;t want to hurt them, and we don&#8217;t want to have to treat them special.&#8217;&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once UCSC coach Dan Porter confirmed with the referee that no rule prohibited women from playing, Stanford and UCSC played. Playing as the hooker in the game, Riehl was at the front of the scrum. Her job was to hook the ball with her foot back into the legs of her fellow scrum-mates where her scrum-half would retrieve the ball and pass it off to backs to run with the ball.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point in the game, Stanford's scrum-half and captain, attempting to send the ball along to his backs, was tackled by Riehl, setting up an opportunity for her team to advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former UCSC rugby player Peter Gelpi recalled Riehl tackling the captain, altering the trajectory of the game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were all very excited by the fact that she tackled somebody who had been involved in objecting to her being on the field,&#8221; Gelpi said. &#8220;The whole play of the game shifted after that; she had the whole team behind her.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That day, UCSC won against Stanford. The majority of UCSC&#8217;s rugby club members were playing the sport for the very first time. Competitively, the club lost a majority of its games but typically held its own against Stanford and UC Davis.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward roughly 50 years later, and both the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s rugby teams at UCSC are some of the campus&#8217;s most competitive sports clubs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad that it&#8217;s grown and flourished since I was there,&#8221; Krone said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fun sport. It&#8217;s a great way to get exercise, it creates good team camaraderie, and there&#8217;s just so much that is learned and gained from being in rugby.

</article-subhead><article-text>The closing of labs on the UC Santa Cruz campus during the COVID-19 pandemic didn&#8217;t stop Benny Mosqueira from his research.<br/><br/>The 22-year-old Porter College student, who will graduate this year with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in molecular, cell and developmental biology, simply shifted his research focus to bioinformatics.<br/><br/>Part of Associate Professor of MCD Biology Susan Carpenter&#8217;s lab and yet hundreds of miles from campus at his mother&#8217;s Inglewood, Calif., home, Mosqueira learned new computational methods to allow him to work remotely. <br/><br/>Hunched for hours over his computer, Mosqueira eventually completed an RNA-sequencing pipeline in order to understand the characteristics of a long, noncoding RNA called LincRNA-Cox2, he said. This long noncoding RNA works in several ways to regulate genes involved in inflammation. Chronic inflammation in humans can give rise to a variety of illnesses, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular disease.<br/><br/>His work led to the co-authorship of a scientific paper published in the Journal of Immunology that described the role of LincRNA-Cox2 in lung injury. It also solidified his path in life. <br/><br/>Raised by a hard-working, single mom in Southern California, Mosqueira knew what it was like to struggle financially and felt driven &#8220;to make something of myself.&#8221; Encouraged by his mother and by scholarships offered at UC Santa Cruz, he arrived on campus intending to become a medical doctor.<br/><br/>Instead, the first-generation college student was captivated by the research opportunities he found at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;including work in three on-campus labs and the chance to use technology like cloning, CRISPR, and RNA sequencing&#8212;and decided to pursue biomedical research as a career. <br/><br/>&#8220;I like research because it is just really pushing boundaries,&#8221; Mosqueira said. To be able to discover information that was previously unknown and use that to benefit people &#8220;really brings it all together,&#8221; he added.<br/><br/>His plans now are to find a job with a biotechnology company, pay off his student loans, and then go to graduate school with the goal of becoming a principal investigator in a university setting. <br/><br/>His four years on campus also will leave his mark on UC Santa Cruz. <br/><br/>As the undergraduate representative in the Physical and Biological Sciences Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, Mosquiera helped start the Work-Study Research Initiative for students who need financial support.<br/><br/>Low-income students, he explained, often need to have work-study jobs to afford college, but many of the jobs are in places like the library or dining halls, which might not contribute to the student&#8217;s success in their career, he said.<br/><br/>&#8220;The program we launched actually provides students with meaningful experience in research labs while being paid and being part of a community in college,&#8221; said Mosqueira, who was a SEMILLA Scholar his first year at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;This is crucial for students&#8217; success.&#8221;<br/><br/>In addition, he served as a mentor to freshman STEM students as part of the campus&#8217;s Mentor Collective.<br/><br/>When he looks back at his years at UC Santa Cruz, Mosquiera said, "I&#8217;m just so amazed by everything that has happened and the experiences I have had. To think about my future is exciting.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d447a6288072704664be42b416f1a3a6"><name>commencement-2022-caldwell-brittany</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Brittany Caldwell</title><summary>Brittany Caldwell, a scholar focused on the impact of early-grade math instruction, has pulled off an impressive feat: earning her Ph.D. in math education and teaching hundreds of students in seminars, all while raising three children.&#13;

Her grit and determination helped her pull off an impressive feat: earning her Ph.D. in math education and teaching hundreds of students in seminars, all while raising three children. <br/><br/>When she gave a recent Zoom interview, Caldwell seemed remarkably calm, in spite of a pressing academic deadline and the blurry little people who kept running back and forth behind her on the screen. <br/><br/>Those shapes, fuzzed by Caldwell&#8217;s Zoom screen settings, were her kids, aged 5, 3, and 1.<br/> A child popped up right beside her and whispered a question in her ear. <br/><br/>She had all three children since the start of her program.<br/><br/>Caldwell specializes in early (pre-K through third grade) mathematics instruction with emergent bilinguals (EBs). Her dissertation, <em>Mathematics Instruction for Emergent Bilinguals in Early Grades: Drawing on Young Learners&#8217; Assets,</em> focuses on teachers&#8217; beliefs and practices around mathematics, mathematics teaching, and student thinking. Her research interests include early-elementary mathematics, teachers and teaching, and professional development.<br/><br/>Through all of life&#8217;s distractions, Caldwell maintained her passion and focus as she studied the way educators teach mathematics to young children, while uncovering reasons why early math education is effective and important.<br/><br/>Earlier in her career, Caldwell wanted to be a kindergarten or first-grade teacher. But once she finished her undergraduate studies and became a preschool teacher, she began to notice that some of her colleagues shied away from teaching their young pupils math. <br/><br/>&#8220;Some were really afraid of math,&#8221; Caldwell said. &#8220;I never felt that way. I&#8217;ve always been a math person. I saw the way these teachers were avoiding it, and that really sparked my interest. I wondered why this was the case, and what I could do about it. At that moment, my focus started shifting away from teaching children and toward teaching educators.&#8221; <br/><br/>Caldwell said that most children enrolled in U.S. schools start math instruction in kindergarten, but she believes there should be room in preschool for what she calls &#8220;playful mathematics,&#8221; which provides a strong and useful platform for students to learn math skills in informal, playful, and interactive ways. <br/><br/>This is the sort of casual instruction that kids learn at home all the time in many interactions, whether divvying up cookies or counting coins. Playful mathematics extends those home-style teaching methods into classroom settings, Caldwell said.<br/><br/>On top of all her at-home responsibilities and her studies, she completed UCSC&#8217;s Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (CITL) Graduate Pedagogy Fellows program, taught an online course with 220 students, and is teaching an in-person course this year with 180 students. <br/>Caldwell has also worked for the English Learner Success Forum, a collaboration of researchers, teachers, district leaders, and fundraisers working to improve the quality and accessibility of instructional materials for English learners.<br/><br/>Next stop is Vanderbilt University in Nashville, where Caldwell will pursue a postdoc in education with funding from the National Science Foundation.<br/><br/>She will be studying remotely, so she will only have to travel to Nashville every once in a while. For now, at least, she will stay put in Scotts Valley.<br/><br/>Raising her kids while continuing to advance her studies will be a lot of work, but Caldwell has devised a system that has worked for her so far. <br/><br/>&#8220;How do I do all this?&#8221; said Caldwell. &#8220;Honestly, it helps to have lots of coffee. But also I have a very strong support system. Both sets of grandparents live close by. My husband is very supportive. My mom does a lot of childcare. She kept telling me, &#8216;I just want to see you get that degree, I want to see you get a good job, and I will do whatever I need to help you get there.&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/05/images/brittany-caldwell-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/05/images/brittany-caldwell-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brittany-caldwell-featured.jpg</name><file-size>52665</file-size><width>590</width><height>240</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Brittany Caldwell</thumb-alt><title>Brittany Caldwell: Adding it up</title><description>A scholar focused on the impact of early-grade math instruction, Brittany Caldwell pulled off an impressive feat: earning her Ph.D. in math education and teaching hundreds of students in seminars—all while raising three children.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d45365fa8072704664be42b42f5c9ee1"><name>commencement-2022-martinez-candy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Candy Martinez</title><summary>The daughter of Oaxacan migrants, Candy Martinez has found a meaningful way to reconnect with her roots, investigating the ways in which Indigenous communities process and heal grief and trauma.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text>The daughter of Oaxacan migrants, Candy Martinez has found a meaningful way to reconnect with her roots, investigating the ways in which Indigenous communities process and heal grief and trauma.<br/><br/>Martinez, who has just received her Ph.D. in Latin American and Latino studies (LALS), has spent several months in her ancestral lands learning the Zapotec language of southern Mexico, and exploring unique cultural traditions relating to fright, grief, and profound sadness and loss, especially as related to gender violence, economic inequality, and emigration. <br/><br/>At the center of her dissertation research are <em>la tiricia</em> (doldrums) and <em>susto</em> (fright), illnesses associated in Oaxaca with perpetual sadness and lethargy.<br/><br/>&#8220;I call them emotional injuries,&#8221; Martinez said. &#8220;They could be known as culture-bound syndromes, a term used by cultural anthropologists.&#8221;<br/><br/>Different cultures have their own idioms, their own ways of understanding what they are feeling, she said. <br/><br/>&#8220;It was really fascinating for me to learn about and know that there are so many words to talk about profound sadness and family separation tied to migration,&#8221; Martinez said. &#8220;Older generations will use terms in their Indigenous language, but newer generations don&#8217;t use these terms as much.&#8221;<br/><br/>Martinez has been able to experience community-based healing in addition to expressions of sadness, and to appreciate the importance of <em>gozona</em> (the Zapotec term for mutual aid) and <em>convivenza</em> (coexistence or living together).<br/> <br/>&#8220;There is a sadness ritual in Mixtec communities,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Often it consists of going to the river, bringing wildflowers and putting the petals in the water, and letting go of one&#8217;s sadness. Basically the idea is that you talk to the elements, tell them your sadness, and drop petals like you are making an offering, but it is also a type of mourning that involves letting go.&#8221;<br/> <br/>Though there are also psychologists in multiple rural Oaxacan towns, Martinez said traditions have greater appeal for some residents.<br/> <br/>&#8220;According to the psychologists of state-funded clinics that I interviewed, there is a low probability that their patients will complete their therapeutic sessions," Martinez said. &#8220;Often, people attend three appointments and stop."<br/> <br/>To complete her dissertation project, Martinez interviewed 65 Mixtec and Zapotec leaders, healers, doctors, and psychologists and participated in 12 <em>limpias</em> (spiritual cleanses) and five <em>temazcal</em> rituals (steam baths). <br/> <br/>Now the wider academic world is taking notice. In 2023, Martinez will head for Poughkeepsie, New York, where she has accepted a ladder-track faculty job at Vassar College, a prestigious liberal arts college. <br/><br/>Martinez will be the inaugural assistant professor in Latin American and Latinx studies at Vassar College, where she will focus on race, injustice, and immigration. <br/><br/>Before she heads off to the East Coast, she will spend the 2022&#8211;23 academic year as a University of California President&#8217;s Postdoctoral fellow at UCLA with the sponsorship of David Delgado-Shorter, professor of world arts and cultures/dance.<br/><br/>Professor Catherine Ram&#237;rez, chair of LALS, praised Martinez for her innovative dissertation. <br/><br/>&#8220;Linking Indigenous, Latin American, Native American, Latinx, gender, cultural, and migration studies, her dissertation promises to make a valuable contribution to our understandings of the relationship among social forces, trauma, healing, tradition, and the dynamism and resilience of Indigenous communities in the Americas,&#8221; Ram&#237;rez said.<br/><br/>Ram&#237;rez also highlighted the many awards Martinez has received to support her work, including the highly competitive Fulbright-Garc&#237;a Robles grant and an Andrew W.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Chailen August&#8217;s time at UC Santa Cruz put him on a path of discovery that he never expected.<br/><br/>The Inglewood, Calif., resident, who will graduate with a minor in Black studies and a bachelor&#8217;s degree in critical race and ethnic studies this year, not only embarked on a study of drill rap&#8212;a type of hip-hop that originated in Chicago&#8212;and its interpretation in Ghana, Africa, but, as part of a prestigious study-abroad program, also had a visceral experience of what his enslaved ancestors may have endured. <br/><br/>Going to UC Santa Cruz &#8220;gave me a lane and a direction,&#8221; said August, 24, Stevenson College. &#8220;I knew going to a UC was a good decision, but I didn&#8217;t know all the opportunities I would have until I got there.&#8221;<br/><br/>He plans to take a gap year after graduation, then attend grad school the following year.<br/><br/>A first-generation college student, August grew up in a tough, sometimes violent, part of the city of Inglewood. But it was while he was attending high school in a nearby, predominately white town that he felt the pain of racism and prejudice firsthand. In high school, for example, a white student picked August&#8217;s photo out of the yearbook (August was the first Black student in the alphabetized list) and accused him of theft in order to deflect from the real perpetrator, August said. August protested his innocence but was handcuffed by police and taken to jail for six hours until his basketball coach confirmed August had been at practice when the theft occurred, he said. His experiences made him feel unsafe in much of America. <br/><br/>His classes at UC Santa Cruz gave him another perspective on what he&#8217;d lived.<br/><br/>&#8220;We talked about the oppression of brown and Black people,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and that was my actual, lived experience&#8230;. It [that study and exploration] added an academic view to my own experiences."<br/><br/>It also allowed him to speak out about the racism he faced.<br/><br/>But it was his receipt of the U.S. Department of State&#8217;s respected Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship that took him to the West African country of Ghana for the fall semester of his senior year. As part of his studies there, he toured Elmina Castle, a coastal compound where tens of thousands of Africans were held in horrible conditions before being shipped away as part of Portugal&#8217;s slave trade. The visit to the stone-walled fortress with doorways so small a person had to crouch to get through them, shook August, whose own family had been brought illegally to the United States at some point. <br/><br/>&#8220;All I could think about was the ancestors who had died there [in Elmina] or in that ocean, or made it across the ocean on that journey,&#8221; said August, who was both a Koret Undergraduate Research Scholar and Pathways to Research Scholar at UC Santa Cruz. Going to the beach later, August said, he was overcome by sadness, mixed with the knowledge of the progression that led him to where he was. <br/><br/>It was the most profound experience of his college years, he said.<br/><br/>Born into a musical family, he also used his time in Ghana to research how drill rap, which was known for its gritty lyrics about violence, guns, and misogyny, changed into a gentler version in Ghana. The music had the same beat, but the lyrics were much less violent. In graduate school, he hopes to focus on rap music and hip-hop scholarship with the goal of earning a doctorate and becoming a professor one day.<br/><br/>Because of the pandemic, August, a transfer student, only visited the UC Santa Cruz campus once. Still, he said, his college experience &#8220;was life-changing in a lot of ways.&#8221;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text>Since he was 6 years old, Maxwell Ward has always wanted to be an archeologist.<br/><br/>Growing up in Carlsbad in San Diego County, he often visited museums and archeological sites with his parents. He vividly remembers attending a lecture at UC San Diego by famed explorer Albert Lin about his unsuccessful search for the tomb of Genghis Khan. And he was in awe of the daredevil archeology professor Indiana Jones in the movie <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</em> <br/><br/>&#8220;I remember thinking when I was a kid, &#8216;What if they discovered everything?&#8217;&#8221; he said. <br/><br/>But he realizes now that treasure hunting is the smallest part of being an archaeologist. The biggest part today is ethics and helping make the discipline accessible to native people who have been historically shut out of it. <br/><br/>His biggest interest is the Incan civilization, which lasted about 200 years on most of the west coast of South America. His studies led him to Ecuador, where he heard about UC Santa Cruz professor Carolyn Dean. He eventually majored in her history of art and visual culture program and came to admire her for her ability to remove her own modern perspectives and paint a more accurate picture of how the Incans viewed their own culture. Ward, a Cowell College student, is also an anthropology major. <br/><br/>During his time at UC Santa Cruz, Ward took advantage of as many opportunities as he could, serving as a student mentor and chair&#8217;s advisory board member for the History of Art and Visual Culture Department. He also served as head writing tutor for the Anthropology Department.<br/><br/>He was able to participate in the UCDC program, securing a spot as collections care intern at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. The museum actually only displays 1&#8211;2% of its collection, with the rest of it stored as at a giant offsite facility, &#8220;like the warehouse of Indiana Jones,&#8221; he said. He saw shelves full of artifacts he had been reading about his whole life, like sacrificial altars, pots, and other crafts. <br/><br/>Ward has a long-term goal of becoming a tenure-track professor. But first, he will go back to Ecuador to do more research this summer, then return to apply for graduate school. He is still deciding between trying to earn a master's degree first or just go straight into a doctoral program. <br/><br/>&#8220;I love talking to people about my field,&#8221; he said. &#8220;To teach people about it is a dream come true.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/05/images/maxwell-ward.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/05/images/maxwell-ward.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>maxwell-ward.jpg</name><display-name>maxwell-ward.jpg</display-name><file-size>149246</file-size><width>1180</width><height>482</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Maxwell Ward in front of McHenry Library sign</thumb-alt><title>Maxwell Ward: Archeological Ethics</title><description>Maxwell Ward (Cowell '22, HAVC and anthropology) grew up in awe of famous archeologists and their hunt for treasure.

</article-subhead><article-text>Being half Latinx and half white, Nicole Rudolph-Vallerga always felt like she didn&#8217;t quite fit into either group. <br/><br/>&#8220;Being categorized as &#8216;in-between&#8217; is a lonely place to be, as those who fall between definitions tend to not be fully accepted by either side, therefore lacking in community,&#8221; she explained on her website. <br/><br/>So, she decided to create her own community with her fall senior art show, &#8220;<a href="https://nicolerudolphart.wixsite.com/home/seance-of-duality">S&#233;ance of Duality</a>,&#8221; at UC Santa Cruz. The show featured photographs and interviews with biracial Latinx people, and incorporated the visual language of Victorian seances and Mexican ofrendas. The goal was to focus on the whole person, not a person divided. <br/><br/>She was touched by how affected viewers were by her work. <br/><br/>&#8220;Some people who came cried,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They said, &#8216;I have never felt seen before, and I feel seen now.&#8217;&#8221; <br/><br/>Rudolph-Vallerga continued exploring the theme this spring with her series &#8220;Liminal Spaces.&#8221; The show addresses moments of transition, such as when someone falls in love or is recovering from a trauma. <br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s these times when we&#8217;re trying to rush through it because it&#8217;s a time of uncertainty and it's hard on us,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I invite the viewer to sit with these moments.&#8221;<br/> <br/>The watercolor series includes the diptych painting <em>Water Lovers,</em> featuring a nude couple connected through time and space, and <em>Cocoon,</em> which features Rudolph-Vallerga&#8217;s own premature baby protected by succulents. <br/><br/>The series is displayed alongside another series, &#8220;Artifacts of Location,&#8221; which includes a book, audio recordings, and a quilt that locate where she was in 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/><br/>Born in Hollywood to a white father and Mexican-American mother, Rudolph-Vallerga grew up poor on a small ranch in the Los Padres National Forest. She worked as a preschool teacher, and then an elementary school art teacher before going to Cabrillo College. She and her husband then transferred to UC Santa Cruz, where they are both pursuing their studies. <br/><br/>Now 39 and the mother of a 3-year-old son, she said it took her a while to figure out how to navigate the bureaucracy of higher education because, as a first-generation college student, she had no guidance on how to proceed. <br/><br/>She is so grateful to be at UC Santa Cruz that she has taken advantage of every opportunity given to her&#8212;a fact that hasn&#8217;t gone unnoticed. She has been named the winner of the Chancellor&#8217;s Award for Arts. <br/><br/>Next up, she plans to pursue a doctoral degree and, ultimately, become a museum curator.

Along the way he not only taught himself German, French, Turkish, and Ottoman Turkish; won a prestigious Fulbright Scholar award; lived for a time in Turkey and Germany; and spent hours in windowless archives; but also completed his doctoral studies in history at UC Santa Cruz. <br/><br/>The cross-disciplinary conversations and experiences at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;including classes he took in history of consciousness, feminist studies, and environmental studies&#8212;were &#8220;an enormous benefit for my career and research,&#8221; said Lawrence, 33, who had wanted to combine humanism with ecological study. <br/><br/>Soon, he, his wife, and two children will move from their home in Bad Reichenhall, Bavaria, Germany, to the U.S., where Lawrence has been hired as an assistant professor at West Virginia University teaching 20th-century European history. <br/><br/>Lawrence&#8217;s Ph.D. work focused on the relationship between Germany&#8217;s Deutsche Bank and the Ottoman Empire, which ruled from the 13th century to the end of WWI. In the late 1800s, the Ottoman government wanted to build a railroad in the Anatolia region of Turkey but, according to Lawrence, it was short on cash. It managed to get a loan from Deutsche Bank, securing it with promises of income from taxes levied on things like fisheries, salt, and farmers&#8217; crops in the region, he said. <br/><br/>The result was that the bank had an incentive not only to build the railroad but also to invest in side projects to increase the amount of taxes it garnered, specifically by building massive irrigation projects to boost agricultural output and thus revenue, Lawrence said. <br/><br/>Villages were flooded, malaria thrived, wheat and barley became major crops, and the landscape was irrevocably altered &#8220;by essentially convincing these groups that these [changes] were the keys to the riches of untapped agricultural potential,&#8221; Lawrence said.<br/><br/>Locals had little or no say in how this kind of salvage capitalism transformed their lives and land. <br/><br/>&#8220;A lot of things we think of as unique to our modern capitalistic world really have roots dating back much further,&#8221; Lawrence explained. &#8220;The relationship between Deutsche Bank and the Ottoman government was symbiotic. They reinforced each other at the expense of regular folks. &#8230; It is the same form of domination that multinational firms apply to rural people today.&#8221;<br/><br/>Lawrence, meanwhile, already has a new research project in mind. Back in the U.S., he will be teaching and also looking at how changes brought on by business development in an area of Turkey have contributed to the rise of a serious, tick-borne disease that can cause hemorrhaging and even death.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d4754a328072704664be42b4c6aa5877"><name>commencement-2022-faasolo-teresa</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Teresa Faasolo</title><summary>Teresa Faasolo decided to study computer engineering because she was good at math and highly interested in computers.

Her experience with coding was limited to Scratch, a programming language geared for children. At the university, she was surrounded by people who were entering coding competitions in high school. <br/><br/>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize I was so disadvantaged,&#8221; said Faasolo, who grew up in East Palo Alto. <br/><br/>She knew she needed help, and she got it at the Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP), which provides support for first-generation college students from low-income families. Through assistance with the program, her grades in computer courses improved and her confidence grew. <br/><br/>&#8220;I understood what I was coding and what I was doing,&#8221; she said. <br/><br/>The students at MEP provided emotional support and network connections, and gave her much-needed advice on the right contacts and how to optimize her time. <br/><br/>&#8220;It was great to learn from seniors or basically anyone who took a class before I was going to take that class,&#8221; she said. &#8220;MEP is like a family to me. They are always there.&#8221; <br/><br/>Faasolo said it was helpful that she did summer internships&#8212;including under the College Track and Emerson Collective First Gen program. Those experiences led to her getting a part-time job as a digital marketing intern with EdLyft, a website that offers tutoring and mentoring for computer science students. Faasolo wrote social media posts, interviewed students about their experiences, and looked over the company&#8217;s content. She has been offered an extension of her EdLyft job. She is also looking into other possibilities and is planning to apply for a full-time position as a hardware engineer. <br/><br/>Her father, a retired sheet metal worker, and her mother, a private caregiver, are thrilled with her success, as is the rest of her close-knit Tongan and Samoan community. It has been hard for her to explain to them what her college experience has been like because they&#8217;ve never been through it. Most of her family members are construction workers, business owners, or government employees. <br/><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;m the first computer engineer in the family&#8212;even in the extended family,&#8221; she said.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/05/images/teresa-faasolo-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/05/images/teresa-faasolo-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>teresa-faasolo-featured.jpg</name><display-name>teresa-faasolo-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>95698</file-size><width>1180</width><height>482</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Teresa Faasolo</thumb-alt><title>Commencement 2022: Teresa Faasolo</title><description>Teresa Faasolo initially found computer engineering to be more difficult than she had expected, but with help from the Multicultural Engineering Program, she regained her confidence—and found a family.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d47ca9598072704664be42b47c8e47a1"><name>commencement-2022-vo-tiffany-ellen</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Tiffany-Ellen Vo</title><summary>Tiffany-Ellen Vo encountered some initial difficulties in college, but with support from the Multicultural Engineering Program she regained her footing.

But that only motivated her to work harder, and she ended up winning the robotics competition. <br/><br/>&#8220;I wanted to show all those boys that you can do the exact same thing, but in a dress,&#8221; she said. <br/><br/>Vo, 22, is graduating this spring from UC Santa Cruz with a computer engineering degree, and has already secured a job as a software engineer at Cisco. <br/><br/>Vo grew up in Pittsburg in the East Bay to Vietnamese parents. They were refugees who came to the U.S. with the hope that their children would have a better life. <br/><br/>&#8220;Education was the most important thing in our family,&#8221; Vo said. &#8220;It was the only opportunity my siblings and I could use to raise ourselves,&#8221; she said.<br/><br/>She attended UC Santa Cruz on a full scholarship but had trouble initially with some of her courses. After the deaths of two family members, she failed some classes at UC Santa Cruz and was initially denied a spot in her major. She appealed, but that was denied too. But with the support of the Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP), which promotes the retention and graduation of diverse students, she was eventually allowed back in the major. <br/><br/>&#8220;MEP has helped me stay in engineering,&#8221; she said, saying the program offers mentoring, tutoring, workshops in r&#233;sum&#233; writing, and job searches for first-generation low-income students. &#8220;It offers basically everything you need to set you up for the industry.&#8221; <br/><br/>Vo diligently took advantage of every opportunity she was offered, including participating in MEP Baskin Engineering Excellence Scholars, a two-week summer intensive for incoming freshmen, and teaching elementary and junior high school girls in a summer Girls in Engineering program. She also interned with Michigan State University to help with the software development of Avida-ED, a software platform that simulates biology lab experiments. <br/><br/>In addition, Vo was first author for research she did with UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Dynamics Autonomous Navigation Surface Engineering and Robotics Lab. The project was a design for an exoskeleton people could wear to help with physical therapy on their upper bodies. <br/><br/>She was thrilled to get the offer for her Cisco job during finals week. She starts the position in July. <br/><br/>&#8220;It is really rewarding to see the finish line in sight and be able to generate income after college,&#8221; she said.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/05/images/vo-tiffany-ellen-cl-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/05/images/vo-tiffany-ellen-cl-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>vo-tiffany-ellen-cl-featured.jpg</name><display-name>vo-tiffany-ellen-cl-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>22791</file-size><width>590</width><height>241</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Tiffany-Ellen Vo</thumb-alt><title>Tiffany-Ellen Vo: Engineering her path to success</title><description>Tiffany-Ellen Vo encountered some initial difficulties in college, but regained her footing with support from the Multicultural Engineering Program.

Sloan Foundation</span></a>&#160;awarded Professor Carlos Maltzahn a $695,000 two-year grant aimed at establishing an open source program office (OSPO) that will serve the entire campus community. The new OSPO will be one of the first four in the United States to have such an office (John Hopkins, RIT, and Vermont are the others) and one of only two public universities. &#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://todogroup.org/#">Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs)</a>&#160;are an organizational innovation developed initially by companies in the tech sector as a way to manage the relationships with open source software ecosystems of strategic importance to their business. The UC Santa Cruz OSPO, together with the three other offices, are adapting this OSPO concept to build on the missions of research universities of research, teaching, and public service.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"We're extremely excited about the establishment of university open source program offices and their potential to legitimize and improve the development of open source software across the research enterprise," said Joshua Greenberg, director of the Sloan Foundation's technology program. "We're especially proud to support the establishment of an office at UC Santa Cruz. This work is being led by an accomplished team and represents an exciting development for the campus&#8212;as well as offering a blueprint for other UC schools."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The UC Santa Cruz OSPO will transcend the scope of Baskin Engineering&#8217;s&#160;<a href="https://cross.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s2">Center for Research for Open Source Software (CROSS)</span></a>&#160;but not replace it. CROSS will continue its education, research, and incubator programs, with an increased focus on the topics of interest of its industry sponsors. CROSS was started by Maltzahn in 2015 to bridge the gap between student work and successful open source projects. Since its establishment, CROSS has raised $2.6 million in industry funding.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;By generously sponsoring CROSS, major corporations including Toshiba, Kioxia, Micron, SK Hynix, Seagate, Western Digital, Samsung, and Fujitsu clearly signaled that industry-university research collaboration via open source strategies and techniques works,&#8221; observed Maltzahn. &#8220;Thanks to their engagement and Sloan Foundation&#8217;s funding, we now have an opportunity to significantly expand this collaboration in innovative ways.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As noted by Interim Vice Chancellor for Research John MacMillan, &#8220;The UCSC Office of Research will work closely with the OSPO team at cross-divisional and corporate engagement and help track funding of open source projects within the university. We are pleased that the Sloan Foundation chose to fund UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s efforts in open source &#160;&#8211; making it the first UC campus with an OSPO. We think this pilot project will allow UC Santa Cruz to be a model for UC campuses and other public universities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As part of the Sloan Foundation award, the OSPO introduces a new incubator fellowship aimed at attracting postdoctoral scholars whose compelling and innovative open source research projects make them natural open source ambassadors to UC Santa Cruz. T</span><span class="s3">he OSPO will establish a teaching fellowship to encourage innovation in teaching students how to productively engage with open source projects.</span><span class="s1">. The OSPO will also promote and track funding of open source research efforts to help estimate the value of open source to UC Santa Cruz and the UC system as a whole.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The OSPO team, led by Maltzahn and CROSS Assistant Director Stephanie Lieggi, runs the&#160;<a href="https://cross.ucsc.edu/2022-osre/index.html"><span class="s2">Open Source Research Experience (OSRE)</span></a>&#160;program, an exchange of summer project ideas that matches student contributors and sponsors with mentors working on open source research efforts. As part of the OSPO, the OSRE will be able to expand and engage mentors across UC campuses and associated national labs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Maltzahn summarized: &#8220;The Open Source Research Experience is the kind of OSPO program we want: inclusive and easy to engage with, highly rewarding, scalable across multiple UC campuses, well-aligned with the goals and desires of stakeholders, and increasing in value with the number of contributors.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p>Harmful algal blooms, often involving toxin-producing cyanobacteria (formerly known as blue-green algae), are affecting lakes, rivers, and other freshwater bodies around the world with increasing frequency. Environmental monitoring programs can detect most of the cyanobacterial toxins, but the unusual chemistry of guanitoxin makes it incompatible with standard detection methods.</p>
<p>Understanding the genetic basis for guanitoxin biosynthesis means that molecular diagnostic technologies can now be used for environmental monitoring to detect the presence of guanitoxin-producing cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>The new findings, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c01424">published May 18 in <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em></a>, include evidence that guanitoxin is likely present in many lakes and reservoirs in North and South America. Guanitoxin has the same mechanism of action as the nerve agent sarin and the banned pesticide parathion, causing acute neurological toxicity that can lead to rapid death. Exposure to it has been associated with the deaths of wild and domestic animals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that we&#8217;ve found the genes and have biochemically linked them to the production of guanitoxin, we hope that we can use PCR-based detection technologies to predict future toxicity and environmentally monitor this toxin,&#8221; said Shaun McKinnie, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz and one of three corresponding authors of the paper.</p>
<p>The other corresponding authors are Marli Fiore at the University of S&#227;o Paolo, Brazil, and Bradley Moore at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. Fiore&#8217;s lab isolated a guanitoxin-producing strain of cyanobacteria almost 20 years ago from the Tapacur&#225; reservoir in eastern Brazil. After sequencing the strain&#8217;s genome, the Brazilian researchers&#8212;led by Stella Lima, then a graduate student in Fiore&#8217;s lab&#8212;found a cluster of genes they suspected were involved in guanitoxin production.</p>
<p>Lima, who is first author of the new paper, went to UC San Diego in 2018 to work with Moore, who had done the first biochemical studies of guanitoxin in the 1990s. McKinnie got involved in the project as a postdoctoral researcher in Moore&#8217;s lab. When he moved to UC Santa Cruz in 2019, his lab continued to work on the guanitoxin biosynthetic pathway in collaboration with the other two labs. Graduate student Jennifer Cordoza led the effort at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole lab helped contribute to this story, however Jenny really ran with it and validated over half of the pathway herself during the first year of her Ph.D.,&#8221; McKinnie said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve now identified all nine of the enzymes involved in how this organism takes the amino acid arginine and converts it into a specialized toxin.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers confirmed their findings by reconstituting the guanitoxin biosynthetic pathway &#8220;in vitro&#8221; (in the test tube, without cyanobacteria).</p>
<p>They also searched for the toxin genes in available datasets of raw environmental sequencing data. The search indicated that guanitoxin-producing cyanobacteria are present in a wide range of locations, including Lake Erie near Toledo, Ohio; Lake Mendota in Wisconsin; the Columbia River in Oregon; the Delaware River in Delaware; and several sites in Brazil.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found these genes in a variety of different freshwater sources, but nobody has looked for or monitored for this particular toxin environmentally,&#8221; McKinnie said.</p>
<p>He explained that detecting guanitoxin directly would require a different analytical procedure from the standard methods used in environmental monitoring for toxins. Molecular diagnostic technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offer an effective alternative for identifying samples that have the potential to be toxic due to guanitoxin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finding the genes in a sample could then justify a more complex procedure to detect guanitoxin directly,&#8221; McKinnie said.</p>
<p>The researchers have filed a provisional patent application based on the concept of using the guanitoxin biosynthetic gene sequences they identified in the lab and applying molecular diagnostics using those sequences to find the genes in the environment.</p>
<p>In addition to Lima, Cordoza, McKinnie, Fiore, and Moore, the coauthors of the paper include Timothy Fallon, Jonathan Chekan, Steffaney Wood, and Hanna Luhavaya at UC San Diego; Austin Hopiavuori and Jackson Baumgartner at UC Santa Cruz; Endrews Delbaje, Felipe Dorr, and Ernani Pinto at University of S&#227;o Paolo; Danillo Alvarenga at University of Copenhagen; and Augusto Etchegaray at Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas, Brazil.</p>

Engineering, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the University of Michigan have received a $275,000 instrumentation grant from the Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) to create a more efficient testing system for autonomous systems through the use of hybrid robotics.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Autonomous systems, such as drones, self-driving vehicles, and walking robots, are designed to achieve a set of goals in changing environments without human intervention.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conventional autonomous system design processes involve separate stages for product design, testing, validation, and risk assessment, with distinct simulation, fabrication, and synthesis tools used at each stage. If failures arise in a later phase, then the process must restart at phase one, greatly increasing time between testing and verification.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The multi-university project titled &#8220;Verification and Validation of Autonomous Systems with Hybrid Dynamics under Uncertainty,&#8221; led by Ricardo Sanfelice, principal investigator and professor of electrical and computer engineering at UCSC, seeks to streamline and accelerate the verification and validation process through a Physical Design Optimization (PDO) paradigm that combines all phases of testing into one setting for autonomous system development. With the assistance of various robotic devices, this paradigm rapidly prototypes the autonomous system&#8217;s design, validates its fabrication, and quantifies both its performance and its failure risk by conducting physical tests.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The instrumentation funding, which will be administered by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), will provide the necessary equipment&#8212;3D rendering and manufacturing machines, manipulators, ground robots, aerial robots, and vehicle robots&#8212;for the researchers to test their design paradigm theory.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The production of a physical robot is one aspect of the design loop and often the most time-consuming,&#8221; said UCSC electrical and computer engineering postdoc Adeel Akhtar, who has been working closely with the researchers on this project. &#8220;With the new machinery, we&#8217;ll be able to minimize human participation in that loop, accelerating the overall process.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The manufacturing and testing equipment will establish a state-of-the-art testing facility, located within the UCSC Hybrid Systems Laboratory (HSL). Different types of robotic devices will work together in the space for real-time manufacturing, experimental testing, and remanufacturing of autonomous systems. The testbed, which will be called the Hybrid Robotics Arena, will provide researchers the opportunity to catch critical failures without having to restart the entire validation process, and remanufacture and reprogram the systems for optimal performance.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It&#8217;s very exciting to see this funding come through,&#8221; said Sanfelice, who leads the HSL and is the Cyber-Physical Systems Research Center (CPSRC) director at UCSC. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to allow us to build this new concept of manufacturing, testing, and re-manufacturing in an experimental testbed, and allow for multi-robot cooperation to build and assemble, and essentially run a system.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additionally, the Hybrid Robotics Arena will be a space for future collaborations across UCSC.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Once this project ends, the instrumentation will remain at UCSC,&#8221; Sanfelice said. &#8220;I envision this being a very exciting addition to our robotics engineering program, which will help attract new students and researchers. It not only allows us to validate our theory in the short term, but also provides exciting opportunities for future robotics and control research.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Akhtar added that this facility will provide undergraduates and graduates valuable hands-on robotics research opportunities, preparing them for industry.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new testing environment&#8217;s computer interface will also permit remote testing and reprogramming, welcoming the opportunity for cross-university research collaborations.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The &#8220;Verification and Validation of Autonomous Systems with Hybrid Dynamics under Uncertainty&#8221; proposal was supported in part by the Cyber-Physical Systems Research Center.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel like because we were all alumni from Santa Cruz, there was already a built-in trust and understanding between the three of us,&#8221; Marcia* said. &#8220;When you align with people who align with your values, I think that&#8217;s where great things can happen. And I think those values that we learned at UC Santa Cruz continue to apply.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones graduated from UCSC with a B.A. in philosophy and a minor in linguistics in 2004. She had extensive careers as a writer, freelance sound operator, an editor, and worked briefly as a conversation designer. In 2020, Jones was laid off from her job and immediately began searching for a new occupation in UX and conversation design.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was interviewing for as many as three different companies simultaneously, most of which encompassed four rounds of interviews. She was frequently interviewing, was adjusting to online interviews early into the pandemic, and sought out the advice of a career specialist.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She landed on career coach Marcia Wall, a Stevenson alumna who offered a discount for her services to UCSC alumni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of Marcia, Jones honed her interviewing and presentation skills and gained profound confidence in herself and her work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was very helpful for her to instill me with confidence and make me feel really good about telling my story,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;She was pretty honest with her feedback and was always helpful in being a partner in my process.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcia graduated from UCSC in 1992 with a B.A. in English and American literature. She worked as a K-12 teacher in San Diego for four years before teaching college English courses at the University of San Diego, San Diego Community College, and the University of New Orleans.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcia said that at some point during her teaching career, she recognized that helping people &#8220;realize and exceed their own expectations&#8221; was what she enjoyed most about teaching. Marcia sought the services of a career coach and saw firsthand the job she wanted for herself.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I started looking back on my career, I realized the through thread was that coaching piece,&#8221;Marcia said. &#8220;As a senior in college, I was a peer mentor to first-year students at UC Santa Cruz, and later I had also been dean of a technical school and a career advisor for high school students. So I&#8217;d been doing that kind of work, and I never really put two and two together.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcia has stayed connected to UCSC since graduating, offering pro bono c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">areer services through webinars, group coaching, and a UC career fair. Last year during alumni week, Marcia gave a presentation on imposter syndrome.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she worked with Jones, Marcia reached out to an old friend from UCSC, Frank Marquardt </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Stevenson &#8217;90, American studies)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who attended UCSC for two years before transferring to Reed College. She connected Marquardt, now a leadership coach with an extensive background in UX design, with Jones so they could share experiences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s always valuable for us to remember that we are connected, and it&#8217;s easy to forget how connected we are,&#8221; Marquardt said. &#8220;It took a long time to figure out my career path and undo some of my own mental blocks around networking. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But over time, I&#8217;ve come to see networking as a really beautiful way to explore another person&#8217;s experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of April, Jones has begun working as a conversation design manager for Verse.io and continues to take leadership classes with Marquardt.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think that the moral in this story is to think more about reconnecting when you&#8217;re at a crossroads in your life and maybe reach back to your university&#8212;in this case, UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Jones said. It&#8217;s a good feeling to know that we all shared that experience.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

Newcombe Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship. The national award provides a year of funding for dissertation writing to scholars who work on ethical or religious issues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levin-Schwartz&#8217;s dissertation research is focused on how women resist and organize against sexual violence and the role that testimony plays in that process. Within the legal system, women who testify in cases of sexual assault are often subjected to victim-blaming stereotypes and are structurally limited in how they can express themselves, Levin-Schwartz explained. Many women ultimately choose to speak up outside of the legal system, as they seek justice and the political power to enact change.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Women who were violated by sexual violence often experience a second assault by the criminal justice system when they give testimony,&#8221; Levin-Schwartz said. &#8220;But testimony can also be a political tool to challenge both sexual violence and the undermining of women in the legal system, and my focus is on civil society as a place where the more disruptive work is happening toward that end.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women&#8217;s testimony in the civil arena has taken many forms over the years, and Levin-Schwartz&#8217;s research explores a few prominent examples. In the 1970s, the anti-rape movement brought a wave of social and political activism in the United States that was fueled in part by women sharing their experiences of sexual assault in consciousness-raising groups, speakout rallies, conferences, marches, and other forums. These efforts brought changes to culture and laws, which Levin-Schwartz says demonstrates the political power of civic&#160; testimony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In many cases, change doesn&#8217;t come from within the law,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We need to put pressure on these systems in order to institute changes, and civic testimony is a way of doing that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently, the internet has offered new forums for testimony. Levin-Schwartz&#8217;s research explores multiple forms of digital testimony, including the #MeToo movement, through which online testimony spread globally on social media, drawing attention to the widespread nature of sexual assault and harrassment and publicly calling out powerful perpetrators.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With testimony in the internet era, we see global connectivity, where movements that start in one place can spread around the world, with each country adopting its own iterations based on unique cultural background, legal battles, and broader societal and political context,&#8221; Levin-Schwartz said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, civic testimony also comes with challenges and barriers, especially around whose voices are heard. Levin-Schwartz says a common critique of the anti-rape movement of the 1970s and the #MeToo movement is that both centered white women, while marginalizing the queer community and women of color, who face increased risk of assault and harrassment and more systemic barriers in seeking justice. Tackling these issues will be crucial to the significant amount of work that still lies ahead in combatting sexual assault within the U.S. and globally.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Conviction rates for sexual assault show that, despite the changes and progress we&#8217;ve seen, we still have a long way to go for women to stand as equal citizens before the law,&#8221; Levin-Schwartz said. &#8220;Civic testimony can work toward that, while also promoting solidarity among survivors, empowering women, and driving social change. &#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e1e10dc28072704664be42b48d960867"><name>indoor-masking-encouraged</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Indoor masking is strongly encouraged</title><summary>Even though masks are no longer required from the State of California and in most UC Santa Cruz facilities, their use indoors, especially in high-density spaces, is strongly recommended.</summary><start-date>1652943600000</start-date><display-name>Indoor masking is strongly encouraged</display-name><path>/2022/05/indoor-masking-encouraged</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/05/indoor-masking-encouraged</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1653057064365</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662582180340</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Like many other areas of our country, we have been experiencing increased COVID-19 positivity rates on campus.

The honor was announced on May 23.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miga and her colleagues, Adam Phillippy, Evan Eichler, and Michael Schatz, led an international team of scientists &#8212; the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium &#8212; to complete the first, gapless sequence of the human genome. Parts of the human genome are now available to study for the first time, allowing researchers to better understand genetic diseases, human diversity, and evolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gaps now filled by the new sequence include the entire short arms of five human chromosomes and cover some of the most complex regions of the genome. These include highly repetitive DNA sequences found in and around important chromosomal structures such as the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes and the centromeres that coordinate the separation of replicated chromosomes during cell division. The new sequence also reveals previously undetected segmental duplications, long stretches of DNA that are duplicated in the genome and are known to play important roles in evolution and disease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer Doudna, a biochemist and winner of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, wrote of her admiration for Miga and T2T Consortium. &#8220;The complete human genome sequence is an invaluable resource that may provide new insights into the origin of diseases and how we can treat them. It also offers the most complete look yet at the genetic script underlying the very nature of who we are as human beings.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward, Miga and the T2T Consortium have joined with the </span><a href="https://humanpangenome.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Pangenome Reference Consortium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to create a new &#8220;human pangenome reference&#8221; based on the complete genome sequences of 350 individuals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standard reference genome (GRCh38) does not represent any one individual but was assembled from multiple donors. Merging them into one linear sequence created artificial structures in the sequence. The Human Pangenome Project will make it possible to compare newly sequenced genomes to multiple complete genomes representing a range of human ancestries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miga is joined on TIME&#8217;s list of the Top 100 Most Influential People of 2022 by Oprah Winfrey, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Mary J. Blige, Emmett Schelling, and many others. The 2022 TIME100 list is chosen by TIME editors.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f1f494968072704664be42b40cbb1dfe"><name>fairy-queen-opera</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>A special outdoor production of The Fairy Queen celebrates the return of fully-staged, live opera at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Music Department presents Henry Purcell’s The Fairy Queen in a very special outdoor production to celebrate the return of fully-staged, live opera at UCSC on May 27 and 28, 2022. &#13;

For two evenings May 27 &amp; 28, 2022, the school&#8217;s dramatic Quarry Amphitheater becomes the setting for this semi-opera, written as incidental music for William Shakespeare&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s an incredible space for this production,&#8221; says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lecturer Sheila Willey, who heads up UCSC&#8217;s unique opera program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Shakespeare&#8217;s play is all about people wandering in the woods and being beguiled by nature. We have never staged a work in the Quarry, but the opportunity to use this gorgeous place, where the audience and the performers would be out in the elements in all their glory, was so full of possibility.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this version of the work, Purcell&#8217;s beautiful vocal and instrumental movements are interspersed with dialogue from Shakespeare&#8217;s play. In piecing it together, Willey wanted to give the audience and the performers as full an experience of Shakespeare&#8217;s much loved characters as possible and to ensure that the very large ensemble of 18 principals all had ample opportunities to train in both song and dialogue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mostly undergraduate principals will be joined by a 45-person strong chorus in a first time collaboration with the University Concert Choir, just one of the many ways that Willey and her collaborators have pulled out all the stops for this elaborate production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC orchestral undergraduates will be joined by about a dozen members of the Central Valley&#8217;s Sequoia Symphony Orchestra whose Music Director Bruce Kiesling, also Conductor of UCSC&#8217;s University Orchestra, will conduct. Graduate students in the Costume Design program at Academy of Arts University of San Francisco have spent a full semester transforming their class into a costume design and production shop for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fairy Queen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, taking this long-time collaboration to new heights. Santa Cruz Shakespeare&#8217;s Jessica Carter is providing wig, hair, and make up design. Lighting design is by Legend Theatrical&#8217;s Dave Dunning; scenic design by Visible Gravity&#8217;s Sean Riley; and sound design by Live Oak Audio&#8217;s Brook Nielsen.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve brought in some very special designers to make this a really unique experience for the students,&#8221; says Willey. &#8220;We wanted this to feel like a true celebration. Because of the pandemic, the students have been deprived of the opportunity to make art together, which is a huge part of being a music student. It felt important to expend a special amount of energy and resources on this production.&#8221;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Performances take place at 7:30pm on both May 27 &amp; 28, 2022.

<p>Raed El Rafei (film and digital media) and Christian David Alvarado (history of consciousness) will receive a $35,000 stipend plus $3,000 for research and up to $5,000 for tuition and university fees.</p>
<p>El Rafaei is examining queer movies made by artists from Lebanon and the diaspora. He plans to show how queer Lebanese artists like himself have developed their own unique perspective that simultaneously adopts, contests and reimagines western references.</p>
<p>El Rafaei worked many years as a journalist, contributing to CNN, the Los Angeles Times, Al-Jazeera and more. He made the hybrid film (combining documentary and fiction) <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfrVn4-NJ00">74 (The Reconstitution of a Struggle)</a></em> about the 1974 student occupation of the American University in Beiruit. He also made a film about transnational gay love story <a href="https://mecfilm.com/index.php?id=3804"><em>Here I am &#8230; Here you are</em></a>, which was screen at the San Francisco Arab Film Festival.</p>
<p>Viewers can learn a lot about Lebanon society and politics from queer films, El Rafei said. Lebanon has always been regarded as a haven for freedom in the Arab region and is considered the most liberal Arab country. El Rafei believes queer films are trying to challenge the way the nation sees itself and present the country in a different light than that built around the heteronormative nuclear family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody has written yet about the breadth of queer film in the region or specifically in Lebanon,&#8221; he said. After earning his Ph.D., El Rafaei hopes to find a job as a professor in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s amazing work being done at this level,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The university as an institution in the U.S. is such an important source of knowledge in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alvarado is investigating how what is most commonly called the Mau Mau Uprising, which ran through the 1950s in Kenya, fits in with the larger processes of decolonization in Africa. His research will show how the Mau Mau were viewed in other parts of Africa and the rest of the globe and how, along the way, the colonial British state suppressed the movement and indiscriminately detained hundreds of thousands of Africans.</p>
<p>Alvarado was originally planning to do a comparative study of educational systems in Africa during decolonization. But in his first research trip to Kenya, he realized that the history of Mau Mau was more multi-faceted and rich than he thought. He soon turned his attention to this movement and how they were viewed compared to other anti-colonial movements and different colonial powers.</p>
<p>Africa has been his area of interest for some time. &#8220;It has become a deep passion, something I&#8217;ve found really rich and fascinating,&#8221; Alvarado said.</p>
<p>His thesis to complete his master&#8217;s degree in history was a study of the politics of history at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. He looked at how the discipline was interfacing with conceptions of gender and patriarchy during the transition into national independence.</p>
<p>As part of his doctoral studies, Alvarado has a designated emphasis in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies. It&#8217;s a new department at UC Santa Cruz and includes faculty from different disciplines, including the sciences and humanities. &#8220;It&#8217;s grown really, really rapidly because of all the interest around these frameworks and how important they are,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Alvarado said the dissertation completion fellowship will help him complete his work. &#8220;It&#8217;s very, very exciting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot to be grateful for.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f71632c78072704664be42b43d9f4485"><name>audrey-stanley</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Sad news regarding Audrey Stanley, Professor Emerita of Theater Arts</title><summary>It is with deep sadness that we write to share the news that Audrey Stanley, Professor Emerita of Theater Arts and the Founding Artistic Director of Shakespeare Santa Cruz, died May 15, at her home in Santa Cruz.

<p>It is with deep sadness that we write to share the news that Audrey Stanley, Professor Emerita of Theater Arts and the Founding Artistic Director of Shakespeare Santa Cruz, died May 15, at her home in Santa Cruz. She was 94.</p>
<p>Audrey was a trailblazer in the theatrical world, and over the course of her life she registered many &#8220;firsts.&#8221; She was in the first class of drama students at England&#8217;s University of Bristol, and she would later found the school&#8217;s Dramatic Society Touring Company. She was awarded the first doctorate in Theater Arts at UC Berkeley. Incidentally, she did so in the late 1960s while teaching in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s still-emerging Theater Arts program. She was the first UCSC Academic Senate appointee in Theater Arts, and would go on to become UCSC&#8217;s first tenured Professor of Theater Arts. She was also the first woman to direct a Shakespeare play at the renowned Oregon Shakespeare Festival.</p>
<p>Audrey is perhaps best known for her work in launching Shakespeare Santa Cruz. She and the late Karen Sinsheimer, wife of then-Chancellor Robert Sinsheimer, were the guiding lights in the company&#8217;s creation in 1982. From the beginning, Audrey&#8217;s vision for the company was to foster links between the academy and professional theater. Shakespeare Santa Cruz grew rapidly into a nationally respected professional Shakespeare festival that connected UCSC&#8217;s faculty and students with professional artists in all areas of production.</p>
<p>In its heyday, Shakespeare Santa Cruz attracted 30,000 to 40,000 theater-goers to the campus every summer, to both its indoor and outdoor performance spaces. Audrey&#8217;s name today adorns the latter: The Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen, located in a spectacular redwood grove by Kerr Hall, was lauded as one of the most beautiful outdoor theater spaces in the country. Actors, directors and designers from all over the country (and from MFA programs at Yale, New York University, Juilliard and those of the whole UC system) created a repertory season that combined Shakespeare and other significant playwrights in provocative juxtapositions. The work of the company appeared in the national press and in the publications of leading scholars and dramaturgs. Today McHenry Library houses a large archive of material about Shakespeare Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The accolades Audrey received over the years for the company&#8217;s creation were richly deserved. Shakespeare Santa Cruz was a wonderful achievement, and a very important part of our campus for a long time.</p>
<p>Audrey was a beloved figure on campus, a pioneering faculty member closely associated with both our Arts and Humanities divisions, and with Cowell College. She was devoted to her students. Friends, colleagues and students recall her as possessing boundless energy with a side of charm, guile and persistence. When she set out to accomplish something, she would not take no for an answer. She was a groundbreaker her entire career, and we are extremely proud that she was so closely associated with our campus.</p>
<p>We offer our deepest condolences to the many in our community who counted Audrey as a close colleague, friend and mentor. We are grateful for her lasting contributions to our university.</p>
<p>A memorial celebration is being planned. Details will be posted on our newscenter when they are finalized.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/> Cindy and Lori</p>

During the forum, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chancellor Cynthia Larive, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer, and Associate Vice Chancellor Kimberley Register will present and answer questions about the 2021-2022 campus budget.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forum will begin at 4:30 p.m. with SUA presenting general introductions and a logistics overview. At 5 p.m. the three panelists will join the zoom room. For the next fifty minutes, they will answer as many questions. In order to allow for as many questions as possible, SUA is soliciting questions ahead of time via&#160; the &#8220;Submit a Question&#8221; form feature at the top of </span><a href="https://video.ibm.com/channel/hhcc8FwwBgL"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Forum attendees can also use this form to submit questions during the event. Four students will monitor and moderate all submitted questions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the forum, SUA and campus leadership will work together to answer any questions that could not be addressed within the allotted time frame. As well, they will offer a recap of all that was asked and answered. The forum will be hosted in webinar format and will be recorded.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By connecting the campus community directly with university leadership, SUA hopes the forum will offer an opportunity for students, staff, and faculty to become more informed about UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s budget, resource allocation, and fiscal decision making process. According to SUA Internal Vice President Kayla Gomez, the idea for the forum emerged from a lot of conversations about accessing university funds and a desire to understand where the money goes. While staff and faculty have traditionally offered similar forums, Gomez believes this is SUA&#8217;s first time hosting such an event. The need is apparent according to Gomez.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She explained, &#8220;There seems to be a constant frustration about where we are getting money from and also not having enough funding to fund essential resources that impact students&#8217; lives. There seems to be a lot of disconnect about where the students&#8217; money is going and what students get out of it. There are a lot of unanswered questions about key funding and where it&#8217;s going.&#8221; In saying all this, Gomez knows the forum itself will not resolve these concerns, but she hopes it&#8217;s a start.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her SUA colleague, VIce President of Diversity and Inclusion Mar&#237;a Dolores Castillo, shares this hope. Like Gomez, Castillo believes this forum offers an opportunity to close the gap that seems to exist between students and administration. When thinking about what would make the forum successful, Castillo surmised, &#8220;I&#8217;d like more students to feel more financially literate. The more we talk about it [budget and funds], the more we are aware of how things work. This awareness helps us know how to allocate resources. Ideally, the forum will also help bridge the divide between administration and students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While SUA is the official undergraduate student government at UC Santa Cruz, Gomez and Castillo want the entire campus community to know they are invited to Thursday&#8217;s forum.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gomez said, &#8220;Everyone is welcome. Undergraduates, graduates, faculty, and staff. Anyone who receives funding or who doesn&#8217;t understand the budget should attend.&#8221;</span></p>

The funding will support her dissertation research on travel abroad programs led by Black women that focus on teaching youth about the African diaspora.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hice-Fromille has won multiple awards recognizing the importance of this research, including the American Association of University Women's Dissertation Fellowship, and the UC President's Dissertation Year Fellowship. She has also received support from The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz. She said she&#8217;s looking forward to the dedicated focus time for her research that fellowships will allow. At the moment, she&#8217;s preparing for the final phase of her field work, a trip to Costa Rica with a group of Black youth and mentors from Baltimore.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hice-Fromille conducts community-engaged research, which means her work is designed in partnership with and in service to community organizations. She first became interested in studying travel abroad when she volunteered as a mentor with an organization in Oakland that was planning trips for local Black youth. After traveling to South Africa with the group, she was so inspired by the unique mentorship and learning she saw taking place between Black women and girls that this became the focus of her research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She later connected with a similar organization in Baltimore and has since been working with youth and leaders of both programs to understand how meaningful travel abroad experiences are cultivated and what impacts they can have for Black youth and their communities. Hice-Fromille approaches these questions through a queer Black feminist framework that recognizes the long history of Black women&#8217;s leadership in community-building across the African diaspora. She&#8217;s also documenting how curriculum design differs from school settings by being grounded in the collaborative networks and cultural traditions of Black communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, she says the planning process for travel programs usually starts with the leaders&#8217; own knowledge and the particular interests of the youth participants. From there, program leaders tap their friends, family, and community elders&#8212;in the U.S. and abroad&#8212;to connect with the youth and share knowledge and skills.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A big part of this process of building the curriculum is &#8216;youth work,&#8217; which is a legacy in Black communities of sharing parenting responsibilities and sharing care for youth,&#8221; Hice-Fromille said. &#8220;Travel abroad programs show how this is a diasporic practice, because the women leading them are drawing on international networks to &#8216;mother&#8217; and support these Black youth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through international travel, youth see connections among Black people in their own cities and throughout the African diaspora and begin to develop a sense of global Black community, Hice-Fromille says. But the differences in lifestyles and ways of being in relationship across Black communities also teach youth to imagine new futures for themselves.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Often, youth start out thinking that a better future means leaving the city they&#8217;re from, and the leaders on these trips work hard to show them that the problems they&#8217;re encountering in their communities are actually systemic, global issues, but there are other ways people encounter and resist them in other communities,&#8221; Hice-Fromille explained. &#8220;This expands their imagination of what it means to be Black as political and spanning the globe.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youth participants often return from their travels with ideas of changes they&#8217;d like to make in their lives, based on their experiences abroad, like eating more fruits and vegetables, for example. But they return to the same material conditions in their communities, including major barriers, like inequitable access to fresh, affordable healthy foods. Group leaders help youth find ways to struggle against these realities and make change by getting involved in local politics and other community service organizations. And lessons from travel can help.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What they&#8217;re learning about survival and resistance and struggle in solidarity is the real impact when they return,&#8221; Hice-Fromille said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s important to me because it has so much to do with what diaspora is as a political project.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="010168df8072704664be42b4abfa6684"><name>spring-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>SAB’s Spring Chancellor Forum</title><summary>Our upcoming spring forum will be with Chancellor Cynthia Larive on 5/31/22.</summary><start-date>1653462000000</start-date><display-name>SAB’s Spring Chancellor Forum</display-name><path>/2022/05/spring-forum</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/05/spring-forum</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1653579278535</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1653579278535</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>It was so good to see so many of you at the picnic this week!

The award recognizes outstanding and innovative contributions to ornithological research.</p>
<p>In announcing the award, the AOS cited Lyon&#8217;s &#8220;clever experiments, insightful field observations, and a deep understanding of ecological and evolutionary theory.&#8221; The Elliott Coues Award will be presented to two recipients this year, Lyon and Bridget Stutchbury of York University.</p>
<p>Lyon&#8217;s research focuses on the ecological and evolutionary basis of reproductive strategies and social behavior in birds, particularly brood parasitism (when birds lay eggs in the nests of other birds), parental care, and mating systems. He has a stellar academic record spanning 45 years and is particularly well-known for his long-term studies of American coots and black-headed ducks, which have become classic textbook examples for instructors of ornithology and behavioral ecology.</p>
<p>Lyon&#8217;s research interests are diverse, thorough, and span a range of other species, including shorebirds and songbirds. The innovative nature of his work is reflected by a body of highly cited papers in top journals, including papers in <em>Nature, Science, PNAS, American Naturalist</em> and <em>Functional Ecology</em>.</p>
<p>Lyon earned a B.Sc. at McGill University, M.Sc. at Queens University, and Ph.D. at Princeton University. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1997.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0295da128072704664be42b4a129ab13"><name>gomez-assoc-dean-dei</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Marcella Gomez appointed as the Baskin School of Engineering’s inaugural Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</title><summary>Marcella Gomez has been appointed as the Baskin School of Engineering’s inaugural Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and will focus on student success and recruitment and retention of historically underrepresented groups in STEM.</summary><start-date>1653548400000</start-date><path>/2022/05/gomez-assoc-dean-dei</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/05/gomez-assoc-dean-dei</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1653605784051</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1654098132121</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Appointments</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value><value>Feature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/05/images/marcella-gomez-new325.png</path><link>site://news/2022/05/images/marcella-gomez-new325.png</link><site>news</site><name>marcella-gomez-new325.png</name><display-name>marcella-gomez-new325.png</display-name><file-size>167141</file-size><width>325</width><height>314</height></image><image-alt>Marcella Gomez in a classroom with students.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/05/images/marcella-gomez80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/05/images/marcella-gomez80.png</link><site>news</site><name>marcella-gomez80.png</name><display-name>marcella-gomez80.png</display-name><file-size>16250</file-size><width>80</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Marcella Gomez in a classroom with students.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Marcella Gomez, associate professor of Applied Mathematics, has been appointed the&#160;<span class="s1">inaugural</span>&#160;Associate Dean of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at the Baskin School of Engineering.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Gomez seeks to foster a community of support for a school that will reflect the demographics of California </article-subhead><article-text><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over her five years as a faculty member at the Baskin School of Engineering, Marcella Gomez has made it a priority to listen to the needs of her students. Now, she cites this as what drew her to accept a new position as the inaugural Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;There's a lot of resilient students, a lot of impressive students,&#8221; Gomez said. &#8220;I think it is critical to make them feel valued, that we like to have them here, that they contribute to the university.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to supporting the growth of a diverse population of students, staff and faculty, Gomez will take action to reinforce the importance of bringing diverse perspectives to the university&#8217;s research mission and the creation of innovative, socially responsible technology.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a Mexican-American who was in the first generation of her working-class family to graduate from college, she was made to feel valued and supported in the education system at some points, but was left to fend for herself in a competitive environment at others.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But throughout her education, by taking advantage of programs supporting diversity and inclusion, she found opportunities along the path to completing her Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology, win the highly competitive UC President&#8217;s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, and fulfill her aspirations to pursue a career in research and academia.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At CalTech, she developed a scientific identity and sense of belonging in the engineering&#160; community, and was inspired by a mentor truly invested in students&#8217; long-term success. As a postdoc, she saw the value of networking and building pipelines that increase visibility and retention of underrepresented groups in STEM.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, she hopes to bring those lessons into practice at UCSC, and build on an existing desire to improve retention and ensure student success, making progress toward these goals while recognizing that there will always be more work to be done.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">&#8220;Engineering leaders have for decades recognized the need to broaden the pipeline into engineering schools and the tech industry and to manifest environments in which women and people of color are given &#8211; and perceive &#8211; unlimited opportunities to contribute and thrive, yet too little measurable progress has been achieved,&#8221; said Dean of Baskin Engineering Alexander Wolf. &#8220;As a faculty member, Marcella Gomez has already demonstrated that she is an agent of change, and with her new platform as associate dean, I am certain that she will be a powerful leader in our ongoing work to become more inclusive, more anti-racist, and more supportive of all our community.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She will focus on recruiting and retaining faculty from underrepresented groups, while inspiring all faculty to help advance student success by promoting engagement between students and faculty outside the classroom. She will facilitate vertical communication among students, staff, faculty and administration. A key element will be mentorship for new faculty to help them develop a sense of belonging and set a course for career success and impact.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I don't think there's a way to do this work well without being on the ground talking to students one-on-one, talking to faculty one-on-one, and talking to staff one-on-one,&#8221; Gomez said. &#8220;I want to understand everyone's backgrounds and needs and experiences, and take that information up into higher-level decision making.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being in touch with and advocating for these needs can help build open communication between students, staff, faculty and the university leadership, as well as helping to shape and execute the university's policies and programs to be truly effective in achieving shared goals.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One such major goal is to bring the school's demographics in line with those of the state of California &#8211; an objective that will in turn promote a talented, diverse workforce in academia and industry.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gomez says this support for students, staff and faculty must come through both culture and financial resources. She hopes to help create spaces to facilitate more faculty engagement with students beyond the classroom, in order to foster connections and create opportunities to promote talented students whose resumes might not be as robust as their peers because they were not afforded as many opportunities.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She also will seek to leverage existing programs, like the <a href="https://mep.soe.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s3">Multicultural/MESA Engineering Program</span></a> (MEP), which provides students academic and personal support, to improve student experience at all levels. These DEI and student success initiatives have expanded through investment by the dean, but still have much room to grow &#8211; currently, MEP can only serve a fraction of the students who qualify.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other such existing programs include the <a href="https://ieh.soe.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s3">Baskin Engineering Inclusive Excellence Hub</span></a>, led by Carmen Robinson since 2020, which is a resource to advance the academic and personal success of students historically underrepresented in engineering fields. The hub drives high-impact initiatives to support faculty in creating inclusive pedagogy and address achievement gaps, as well as student programming such as the Baskin Engineering Excellence Scholars (BEES), which provides targeted academic support for first-year engineering students in coding and mathematics classes, areas that tend to exhibit the most extreme achievement gaps.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">Matt Guthaus, Associate Dean for Graduate Studies, has been working to strengthen Baskin Engineering&#8217;s Cal-Bridge Computer Science program, aiming to increase the number of California State University (CSU) students from traditionally underrepresented groups pursuing Ph.D.s in computer science at UCSC. Guthaus collaborates with Jim </span><span class="s2">Whitehead, Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs, to promote and expand the Baskin Inclusive Curriculum and Engineering Pedagogy initiative. This currently includes Individual Instructional Consultation (IIC), which provides instructors one-on-one opportunities to investigate a question they face related to curriculum, teaching, or assessment, as well as the Engineering Teaching Community program (ETC) that provides Senate faculty and lecturers a weekly, welcoming, developmental opportunity to improve teaching and assessment practices in community.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Whitehead has also been working on a Student Success Improvement Plan, an initiative to narrow and close achievement gaps in classes that currently act as barriers for students in their degree progress.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This summer, Baskin Engineering will welcome the second cohort of students and faculty funded by the <a href="https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/summer-fellowship-anti-racism-research"><span class="s3">Fellowship for Anti-Racism Research</span></a>, which supports research that investigates racism and bias in technology/engineering or that explores tools to fight racism and bias through technology.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="02b0abf28072704664be42b4d02e2e00"><name>annual-overtime-compensation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>2022-2023 Annual Overtime Compensation Election for Represented Non-Exempt Employees</title><summary>During the month of June, for the departments/units that continue to offer the option of compensatory time, employees in the bargaining units listed above can make a change to their current overtime compensation election.</summary><start-date>1653548400000</start-date><display-name>2022-2023 Annual Overtime Compensation Election for Represented Non-Exempt Employees</display-name><path>/2022/05/annual-overtime-compensation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/05/annual-overtime-compensation</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1653607541705</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1653607541705</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The month of June is the annual overtime compensation election period for represented non-exempt employees in the following bargaining units:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The William Hyde and Susan Benteen Irwin Scholarship Fund, established in 1986, offers twelve annual merit scholarships to further the education of selected UCSC students for proven excellence in the arts. The scholars are nominated by Art Department faculty to submit a portfolio of work and then are selected by an all faculty vote. The annual, professionally organized exhibition has become a tradition in the Art Department and for the Sesnon Gallery for 36 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s showcase, titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irwin 2022: Emulsion, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">examines, reevaluates, and processes the nuances of questions brought about by living in a turbulent moment of change driven by shifts in politics, the impending climate and mental health crises, and the rapid acceleration of technology. The emerging artists, who developed the theme together, wanted to interrogate the question, &#8220;How can we make sense of our position in the natural world and a society that is constantly evolving?&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emulsion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on view June 1-30, features new work created for the exhibition by Aja Bond, Marceline Cyrus, Brennan Elliott, Thomas Goldie, Nico Gu, Elena Ibbetson, Valerie Jackson, Lucien Jacobs, mari mafnas, Amelia Smyth, Elijah Solow Ohashi, and Christy Yee and includes animation, photography, immersive installation works, printmaking, painting, sculpture, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The artists have been involved in every aspect of exhibition planning from conceptualization to marketing and art installation. &#8220;This annual showcase gives the students the full experience of what putting an exhibition together is like,&#8221; says Gallery Manager and Museum Preparator Louise Leong. &#8220;Right now, we are working through important display decisions, really talking with them in the space about how to create a relationship between the audience and the work. It&#8217;s such an important learning experience and is certainly the most hands-on and supported exhibition effort by students of the year.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christy Yee, one of the exhibiting artists, decided to tackle one of her most ambitious project concepts for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emulsion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the creation of a duplicate of her own body in red as a form of self confrontation, &#8220;...like shedding a skin and looking back at the shell that held me,&#8221; she writes. She gathered a trusted team of seven to help. &#8220;I was covered in a quick-setting silicone followed by a layer of plaster. I had to sit in the same position for three hours, completely still, slowly becoming inhibited from movement, speech, sight. And for the latter half of the three hours, my muffled speech was my only form of communication. This acted like an exposure, having to rely on the skills and minds of others to make my idea come to life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This cohort of Irwin Scholars is showing exceptional attention to the production of their artworks,&#8221; says Enrique Martinez Leal, Associate Professor of Art, who served as faculty advisor this year. &#8220;The Irwin Scholarship has proven to be an astounding opportunity for UCSC art students by providing them with the material resources and professional support of faculty and staff to develop their projects. I feel this process has advanced their understanding of creative practices and will serve them well in the future as it reflects their evolving sensibilities.&#8221;</span></p>

playable media (AGPM) undergraduate students collaborating on their senior capstone project set out to design a fun, engaging game. None of the 10 students at the time thought that Squish, the game they developed, would eventually get picked up by a major publisher and released onto the Nintendo Switch platform.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Squish is a fast-paced, competitive multiplayer game featuring skelegoos&#8212;ghoul-like characters&#8212;that must escape a collapsing underground crypt. The game begins with the characters partying so hard that the ceiling begins to fall down. In order to escape without getting squished, players must navigate the skelegoos around various obstacles and utilize the environment to their advantage.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The thing we kept saying during our three-quarter capstone is that this game belongs on Switch. Our dream was to get it on the Switch console, and now it&#8217;s happening in a month,&#8221; said Fernando Zamora, Squish music and sound producer (Porter &#8216;19, AGPM).&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Level 0: Game design conceptualization</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The computer game design B.S. and AGPM B.A. programs require students to complete a three-quarter capstone project. Engineering and AGPM students work in teams to design and produce a novel game. The first quarter focuses on game brainstorming and prototyping followed by two quarters of production and fine-tuning.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the first quarter, the Squish team decided on a spooky aesthetic and a design and name for the main characters of the game&#8212;skelegoos. Prototyping and idea development began with cardboard models before being transferred to computer production.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Team members refer to Squish as a mashup between Tetris and Super Smash Bros. The original game format was inspired by a community level within the puzzle platform video game series Little Big Planet.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I find a lot of games are inspired by what game developers grew up playing. You can see that in the design and aesthetics of Squish,&#8221; said Reed Scriven (Merrill &#8216;19, computer game design), Squish technical art designer and media relations manager. &#8220;We wanted to design something that was interactive, fun, and can involve multiple players.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By the end of the third quarter, Squish was chosen as a finalist for the E3 College Game Competition. The southern California summer gaming convention &#8220;helped put us on the radar for publishers and was a major stepping stone for our game,&#8221; stated Athene Yip (Rachel Carson &#8216;19, AGPM), president and environmental design producer for Squish.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Level 1 and beyond: From competition to publication</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After speaking with Warner Brothers at the E3 competition, the Squish team was referred to major game publisher PM Studios. By summer 2020, the team, which was now reduced to five alums with the other five leaving to pursue other career opportunities, signed a contract with PM Studios.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aided by the expertise of PM Studios, the team was able to improve game production, add a multiplayer format, and enhance the user experience with new designs and music.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I like to joke and say that this has been the longest homework assignment I've ever been given. But it&#8217;s all helped to build experience,&#8221; Zamora said. I&#8217;m excited to continue building on this and make this the best game we can possibly make.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Squish was first introduced to gaming enthusiasts in August 2021 at PlayNYC, a small convention geared towards indie games. Within a month, they were showcasing their game at the popular and major west coast gaming convention PAXWest.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;With a few major companies not at that event due to COVID concerns, it gave us a chance to shine. We had people coming back multiple times telling us how much they liked the game and wanted to play it again,&#8221; Yip explained.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By the April 2022 PAXEast gaming convention, Squish had built up a fan base, and gamers who attended previous conventions were excited to try out the game again&#8212;an indication of Squish&#8217;s increasing popularity.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The latest convention was memorable in more ways than one for the small Squish team. It provided a moment to reflect on three years of hard work and a way to celebrate while looking forward to the upcoming game release to Nintendo Switch and Steam.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;When I think back to the beginning, I felt like this was a cool game idea and I really enjoyed being around my team members,&#8221; Zamora said. &#8220;None of us thought this was going to continue on and become something more.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With Squish&#8217;s upcoming digital and physical release, the alumni team members reflected on the game development process, beginning with their time at UC Santa Cruz. Yip, Zamora, and Scriven mentioned that although they are a small team, they were able to use that to their advantage during the entire production process. It allowed them to collaborate closely with one another, generating new ideas for content and how to improve the user experience.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"Being able to see a project through to the end like this has brought up so many lessons and experiences that have been invaluable to our growth and development,&#8221; Reed reflected.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite facing the challenge of lacking industry experience, the Squish team quickly proved their potential and successfully found opportunities to continuously grow.

Santa Cruz County, and much of the surrounding Bay Area, continue to be at the Medium level for community transmission, according to the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CDC).</span></p>
<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz strongly recommends that students, faculty, and staff wear masks indoors, especially in high-density spaces. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masks are still required for on-campus public transportation and in clinical settings, such as Student Health Services and at indoor COVID-19 testing sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus leaders are closely monitoring the number of COVID cases in Santa Cruz County and if conditions warrant, may require masking indoors at campus facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free surgical and KN95 masks are available at </span><a href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various campus locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
