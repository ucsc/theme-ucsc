Having only taken a two-week Girls Who Code web development camp to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, she decided to dive right in and see what hackathons were all about, hoping to gain new technical skills and meet new people along the way.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, two years, 14 hackathons, and countless mentorship and leadership roles later, Saini, a rising second-year computer science: computer game design student at the UC Santa Cruz Baskin School of Engineering, has been named one of 50 Top hackers of 2022 by Major League Hacking (MLH). Each year, MLH, the official student hackathon league and the largest, global early-career developer community, selects 50 recipients from a pool of over 150,000 active community members worldwide for their exceptional contributions to the tech ecosystem and STEM education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221;To be selected is to have your achievements recognized as the top percent of the top percent of new technologists today,&#8221; said Nick Quinlan, MLH chief operating officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saini was notably recognized for her commitment to supporting new hackers through various leadership and mentorship roles she&#8217;s held.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was a bit shocked to learn that I had won this award having entered the hackathon community about two years ago, but I was also proud to see how far I&#8217;ve come with my hackathon journey,&#8221; Saini said. &#8220;I remember thinking that hackathons were about breaking into computers, but in my first hackathon, I quickly learned that they were not. I started with knowing very little about coding, and now I have all this experience with front-end and back-end technologies, cloud products, and more. My participation in hackathons has fueled my desire to pursue a computer science degree and career in technology.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Tapping into new passions</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saini competed in her first competitive hackathon during her senior year of high school. With minimal coding experience, she and her team of friends developed a website to help middle and high school students explore a broad range of career pathways and prepare for college.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after completing her first hackathon, Saini joined TechTogether, a nonprofit organization that hosts programs and hackathons across the country with a focus on building an inclusive hacking community for women and non-binary individuals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;TechTogether is one of the most inclusive communities that I have been a part of. I've had the opportunity to develop strong relationships with industry professionals and students, some of which have become good friends of mine,&#8221; Saini explained, who is currently a TechTogether mentor primarily working with first-time hackers.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was through TechTogether that Saini learned about the MLH community. In addition to participating as a hackathon competitor, she has also taken on the roles of coach, mentor, judge, and organizer within the MLH organization. As Saini discovered a passion for computer science and worked to develop a suite of technical skills, she wanted to find a way to give back to the hackathon community. One of those ways has been helping others, especially new hackers, find their footing and build their computer science skills.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked what advice she has for students who want to get involved in hackathons but are lacking the confidence to get started, she said, &#8220;Just go for it. Hackathons are for everyone, regardless of your educational background.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>A community of women engineers</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to choosing a university to attend, finding a community of women engineers was one of the most important factors for Saini.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One thing that differentiated the Baskin School of Engineering from the other engineering schools I got into was how many women were studying computer science,&#8221; Saini explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s important for me to be a part of a diverse and inclusive community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saini decided on the Baskin Engineering computer science: computer game design program because she wanted to blend together her passions for programming and graphic design.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My entire first-year experience at UC Santa Cruz was wonderful&#8212;from being surrounded by a welcoming community to meeting new friends in and out of my program, I enjoyed every bit of it,&#8221; Saini said. &#8220;Outside of my degree program and all the work around hackathons that I&#8217;ve done, I am also involved in the UCSC Adventure Rec program. Every outdoor activity I take part in is a great way to decompress from my busy schedule and help recharge my creativity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next few years, Saini plans to continue participating in hackathons across the nation as a competitor, judge, coach, and mentor and explore the field of human-computer interaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to have such a strong engineering community here at UCSC. I used to be so intimidated being one of the few technology girls in the room,&#8221; Saini said. &#8220;But that fear has gone away at Baskin. Everyone is so friendly and always willing to help you succeed.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6593cc60807270467d9111ec05a7c917"><name>cs-gateways-research</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New research explores opportunities for eliminating equity gaps in computer science gateway courses </title><summary>New research shows how addressing “gateways within gateway courses,” specific factors that hold able students back from success in introductory courses, may provide a path forward for closing equity gaps for students pursuing engineering degrees.</summary><start-date>1659556800000</start-date><path>/2022/08/cs-gateways-research</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/cs-gateways-research</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1659561561140</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1659561655612</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/carmennarges_350.png</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/carmennarges_350.png</link><site>news</site><name>carmennarges_350.png</name><display-name>carmennarges_350.png</display-name><file-size>288171</file-size><width>350</width><height>466</height></image><image-alt>Robinson and Norouzi smile for a selfie and hold up conference badges.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/carmennarges_80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/carmennarges_80.png</link><site>news</site><name>carmennarges_80.png</name><display-name>carmennarges_80.png</display-name><file-size>18272</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Robinson and Norouzi smile for a selfie and hold up conference badges.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Carmen Robinson (left) and Narges&#160;Norouzi, who are leading research into gateways in introductory engineering courses, at the 2019 Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Addressing &#8220;gateways within gateway courses,&#8221; specific factors that hold able students back from success in introductory courses, may provide a path forward for closing equity gaps for students pursuing engineering degrees.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Introductory engineering courses often serve as barriers to students&#8217; success in pursuing their chosen degrees, causing attrition rates that are disproportionately high amongst students of color, women, first-generation students, and students who have experienced inequitable systems financially, educationally, and socially.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New studies led by Director of Student Excellence, Engagement, and Inclusion at the Baskin School of Engineering Carmen Robinson and Computer Science Assistant Teaching Professor Narges Norouzi identify Computing Assembly, a required course for most UCSC engineering students typically taken in the first year, as the main gateway course with wide and persistent equity gaps. As an increasing number of incoming students at UC Santa Cruz are choosing to study computer science, the new research reveals how motivation and a sense of belonging within the engineering community vary among students and are often tied to academic measures of success.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We have students who are super talented, who have these great abilities, but they are being held back in some space,&#8221; Robinson said. &#8220;So, how do we fix that? How do we make sure that we move them all the way through to get a degree?&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Years of research and programming</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2019, Robinson conducted a student experience study, including a survey among all Baskin Engineering students, to investigate factors that are influencing students' ability to declare and complete an engineering degree. The study included one-on-one interviews, focus groups, and institutional data. The survey asked about students&#8217; demographics, concerns about their daily lives, if and how much the students were working, what support they might be getting from family, and how much academic preparation they had coming into introductory courses.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We essentially looked into the survey data, particularly pre-college mathematics and programming preparation as well as science motivation and growth mindset indicators,&#8221; said Norouzi. &#8220;What we noticed was a disproportionate pre-college preparation gap between students from different demographic groups. Inspired by the data, we got interested in bridging that preparation gap.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The results led Robinson and Norouzi to establish a summer program to review math and programming concepts for incoming students identified as having varied preparation. The program, called <a href="https://mep.soe.ucsc.edu/baskin-engineering-excellence-scholars"><span class="s2">Baskin Engineering Excellence Scholars</span></a> (BEES) and with Norouzi as the faculty lead, was run virtually during the summer of 2020 and 2021, and in 2022 will be held in person for the first time.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 50 incoming students in this year&#8217;s program will attend programming and mathematics lectures, participate in problem-solving sessions, and end their days with team-building activities. They will also be introduced to on-campus resources such as <a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s2">Counseling and Psychological Services</span></a> (CAPS) and the <a href="https://drc.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span class="s2">Disability Resource Center</span></a> (DRC) and participate in activities to build confidence and a sense of belonging.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9637267?casa_token=9gOzxioRXXMAAAAA:DfDBZky1hgnKstQIMPGo2VGiCWIn7HDKGLh-eytvYlWLbDlxRxrKe-xgl7zxhPoaGwlG7lsm-A">A paper</a></span><span class="s1"> presented at the 2021 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference details BEES program&#8217;s curriculum and daily schedule, citing data that the program is effective in preparing students for engineering coursework. This paper analyzed the success of the program in providing students with academic self-competency in programming and mathematics concepts as well as supporting students&#8217; sense of belonging on campus, science motivation, and science identity.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">BEES students also received targeted tutoring for first-year courses, mentorship, and advising that supported their learning experiences throughout their first year at UCSC. To enhance the cohort-based model of the program, the UCSC Committee on Education Policy approved first-year priority enrollment for BEES students so they can be enrolled in the same discussion section of courses and receive more targeted tutoring from the program.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Gateways and opportunities in intro courses</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In evaluating student performance alongside this earlier work, Robinson and Norouzi noticed that Computing Assembly (CSE 12) was particularly difficult for students. Institutional data showed that students across the board were struggling with the course, with passing rates and grades of B or better lower for underrepresented students. Starting in spring 2021, the researchers worked with CSE 12 instructors and the <a href="https://iraps.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s2">Institutional Research, Assessment, and Policy Studies</span></a> (IRAPS) unit to collect data on why students were falling behind.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pre- and post-surveys for the course gathered data about students&#8217; science motivation and sense of belonging to determine how these indicators are connected to students' lack of confidence and attrition from engineering. Bi-weekly surveys kept track of how students learned and progressed through the course materials to determine if any particular topics tend to lead to students&#8217; failure. Identifying these specific areas can help the instructors and mentors give more targeted preparation and tutoring to increase student success.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We want to see if we can identify any gateway topic in the course that contributes to the overall failure,&#8221; Norouzi said. &#8220;Or if there are any specific set of topics that, if emphasized more, can improve the students&#8217; grade and passing rate while also improving students&#8217; non-academic indicators.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Robinson and Norouzi hope similar analysis can be done for other gateway introductory engineering courses. Additionally, they want to increase the number of students of color who transfer to UCSC to study engineering and provide more support for their specific challenges through a bridge program tailored to their transition.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By presenting and discussing these papers with the community of computer science educators, Robinson and Norouzi hope to identify &#8220;gateways within gateway courses.&#8221; They hope to target future interventions to build community and increase a sense of belonging.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To this end, this work <a href="https://icer2022.acm.org/details/icer-2022-work-in-progress-workshop/9/Gateways-within-Computing-Gateway-Courses-"><span class="s2">will be presented</span></a> at the 2022 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research (ICER 2022) on Saturday, August 7. The team will also present a workshop session at the 2022 Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics &amp; Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) National Diversity in STEM conference titled &#8220;How to make most of your transition to a 4-year institution and beyond!&#8221; to discuss ideas for bridge programs for transfer students.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We have our work ahead of us, but there are multiple ways to help students believe that they can succeed,&#8221; Robinson said. &#8220;I think our faculty are very open to those things, and we do the work we can on the front end.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="697f1aee80727046547eef6b9b0ed6f0"><name>knauss-fellows</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Two UCSC grad students are finalists for prestigious Knauss Marine Policy Fellowships</title><summary>The finalists for the John A.

<p>&#8220;These are highly competitive fellowships, and the experience they gain is amazing,&#8221; said Daniel Costa, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS).</p>
<p>Stovall earned her M.S. in coastal science and policy this year, working on a reef restoration project for coastal hazard risk reduction with the Nature Conservancy and Michael Beck, IMS research professor and AXA Chair in Coastal Resilience.</p>
<p>Willis-Norton said that, after carefully considering her options, she has decided to take a postdoctoral position at UC Santa Barbara instead of the Knauss Fellowship. She completed her Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB), working with EEB Professor Mark Carr and Adjunct Professor Elliott Hazen to study how marine ecosystems on the U.S. West Coast are responding to climate change.</p>
<p>The Knauss Fellows will be matched with their host agencies later this year. Federal agencies that have hosted fellows in previous years include NOAA, FEMA, EPA, and NSF. The 2023 class represents the largest in recent years with 86 finalists.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6993e3c380727046547eef6b60ba16ad"><name>dickens-universe-2022-dan-white</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Dickens Universe returns to campus</title><summary>The Dickens Universe, now in its 41st year, returned to campus in late July after two years in the virtual realm.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dickens Universe, now in its 41</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> year, goes far beyond a traditional literary scholarly conference. It also functions as a festival, a book club, and, in the words of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Yorker</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> writer Jill Lepore, a &#8220;Dickens camp.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic forced the conference to hold online versions for 2020 and 2021, preserving the Dickens Universe&#8217;s intellectual and community spirit while putting some of the joyous analog aspects on hold.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, those in-person touches were back in force on campus for the first time since 2019.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickens Universe co-Director John Jordan, a research professor of literature at UC Santa Cruz, was beaming as he looked out at the crowd at the opening discussion. &#8220;This is very emotional,&#8217;&#8217; Jordan said to loud applause. &#8220;It is wonderful to see so many old friends and newcomers.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder praised the Dickens Universe&#8217;s longevity and reach at a kick-off event for the Dickens Universe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Humanities Division at UCSC is dedicated to bringing humanities to a broad range of public audiences,&#8217;&#8217; Alinder said. &#8220;Efforts like the Dickens Universe unite students, teachers, scholars, and members of the community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Reading literature in community is a foundational humanistic practice,&#8217;&#8217; Alinder said. &#8220;This provides so many opportunities for connection particularly during a pandemic that has upended our lives in so many ways.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A tale of two books</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five times in its history, the Dickens Universe has focused on a book by Dickens in juxtaposition with a book by another author.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, conference-goers did a deep read of the Dickens classic </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Copperfield</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, first published in serial form in 1849 and 1850, and also delved into Frances E. W. Harper&#8217;s 1892 novel </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iola Leroy, or Shadows Uplifted. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">They</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">attended panels that juxtaposed Harper and Dickens, including one called </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Reading Race With/in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iola Leroy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Copperfield.&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harper was known for her anti-slavery advocacy as well as her support for the temperance movement and women&#8217;s suffrage. The 19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-century African American abolitionist and writer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">William Still described her as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"one of the most liberal contributors as well as one of the ablest advocates for the Underground Railroad and the slave."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orphaned at the age of three, Harper found inspiration in her abolitionist uncle, who established his own academy for black youth. In addition to her novels, she published many newspaper articles, poetry collection and essays. Harper also lectured widely.&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iola Leroy&#8217;s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> title character is the daughter of a wealthy southern plantation owner. Her life is thrown into turmoil when her African American ancestry is discovered and she is remanded into slavery.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The readings of a Dickens book in conjunction with Harper&#8217;s is part of an important evolution within </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victorian Studies in recent years, John Jordan said. Jordan mentioned Victorian Studies&#8217; increased focus on global issues and 19th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-century transatlantic relations, especially with respect to issues of slavery and its legacy in both Britain and North America.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Victorian Studies is becoming more invested in conversations about race in the Victorian era and in conversations about things taking place outside of England,&#8221; said Brigitte Fielder, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and a featured speaker at Dickens Universe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is an exciting opportunity to introduce Harper and some of her contemporaries to an audience who may not otherwise encounter her,&#8221; said Fielder, an expert in 19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">century American literature, especially African American and women writers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A close reading of the two books allowed scholars and conference-goers to use several different approaches and analytical methods. Guest Dickens Universe lecturer Helena Michie, the Agnes Cullen Arnold Professor of Humanities at Rice University, and Rice&#8217;s director of the Center for Women, Gender and Sexuality, used the two books to show how Dickens and Harper responded to conventions involving the classic Victorian marriage plot, with its traditions of &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; suitors and marriage proposals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michie used the marriage plot to examine politics, racism, and agency in both books. The classic marriage plot, in books with a white protagonist, often serves up rakes and rivals as well as &#8220;internal obstacles&#8221; to a good marriage. In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Copperfield,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the title character has to sift through multiple crushes, as well as an unwise marriage cut short by his first wife&#8217;s untimely death, before he marries his beloved Agnes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Copperfield faces many obstacles on the way to a good marriage, Marie, mother of Iola Leroy, has no agency at all. She has no choice when asked to consider a marriage proposal by the wealthy slaveholder Eugene Leroy in Mississippi.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michie pointed out a cruel irony that compounds Marie&#8217;s powerlessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How can we think about tge&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">marriage plot when all these assumptions about marriage are null and void, and when chattel slavery makes marriage impossible, when even after the end of slavery interracial marriage remains illegal?&#8221; Michie said. &#8220;Both novels in different ways invoke bigger structures that make choice difficult, or, in the case of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iola Leroy, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">impossible.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The writer Elizabeth Stacey of Monterey, who attended the conference, had never read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iola Leroy </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before. &#8220;I was blown away by the book,&#8221; Stacey said. &#8220;Large parts of it seemed very contemporary, especially the frank way she writes about racial and feminist issues.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://dickens.ucsc.edu/programs/dickens-to-go/illustrating-the-old-curiosity-shop.html">Christian Lehmann</a>, who is part of the Dickens Universe faculty, and has the initials of Charles Dickens tattooed on his left bicep, spoke about the experience of reading the two novels together. The stark differences in their styles call attention to Dickens's and Harper's craft choices, he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Harper doesn&#8217;t do some Dickensian things like the florid repetition or the wild exuberance of different characters being recognizable by their speech, and we realize that&#8217;s a choice, and it helps us understand craft at that level,&#8221; Lehmann said.</span></p>
<p><strong>Cutting loose with other Dickens readers</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seminars and lectures delved into heady topics, but the organizers also made sure that the conference-goers had plenty of opportunities to socialize and cut loose.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickens readers packed lecture halls, nibbled cookies, gave directions to befuddled people searching for hard-to-find classrooms, and spoke about Dickens characters as if they were real people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel sorry for Uriah Heep!&#8221; said one attendee, referring to the loathsome archvillain from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Copperfield</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;I think he was treated badly all his life and had no good role models. No wonder he lacked a moral compass.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some conference-goers, the Dickens Universe was part of a COVID pandemic coping strategy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to be here, and I&#8217;m meeting a lot of other seniors,&#8221; said Carolyn Oppenheim Schwartz, a conference attendee from Los Angeles County. &#8220;Aside from my cat, Izzy, the thing that got me through the pandemic was attending Dickens fellowships all over the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickens Universe provides a feeling of fellowship and common purpose for readers who enjoy being among people who have read deeply in the author&#8217;s work. <a href="https://dickens.ucsc.edu/news-events/news-by-year/2019-2020/caitlin-croughan-profile.html">Caitlin Croughan </a>of Marin County, a self-proclaimed Dickens fanatic, re-read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Copperfield</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and listened to the audiobook twice to prepare for the conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is 56 hours of reading just for the novel, but every time I listened, I noticed new things,&#8221; Croughan said. &#8220;When people died, I openly wept, and when something absurd happened, I laughed out loud.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dickens Project, which hosts the Dickens Universe each year, is also known for its outreach to high school students. </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through its partnership with the </span></i><a href="https://communities.usc.edu/college-access/nai/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">USC Neighborhood Academic Initiative</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NAI), the Dickens Project offers up to </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">four</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> scholarships each year for NAI high school students to study Dickens amid the redwoods.&#160;</span></i></p>

<p>The scholarship will support Ellis&#8217;s work assessing the impacts of offshore wind energy development on seabirds and evaluating the efficacy of feasible mitigation measures, with a focus on the California Current Ecosystem. Through her research, Ellis hopes to facilitate renewable energy development while ensuring that seabird populations aren&#8217;t jeopardized.</p>
<p>This highly competitive scholarship program provides support for master&#8217;s and doctoral degrees in oceanography, marine biology, and maritime archaeology, with a particular emphasis on supporting the careers of women and minority students.</p>
<p>Ellis is working with Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Professor Donald Croll and Adjunct Professor Bernie Tershy, who lead the <a href="https://ccal.ucsc.edu/">Conservation Action Lab</a> at UC Santa Cruz. She entered her Ph.D. program with over 10 years of experience working in the field. She received her bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan, where she was part of a team that worked on a dataset of 40,000 songbird window collisions to study changes in body size related to climate change&#8212;research that has since been awarded the Ecological Society of America&#8217;s George Mercer Award for outstanding ecological research published by young authors. As an undergraduate, she also worked with Project Puffin to contribute to seabird research and management in the Gulf of Maine.</p>
<p>Ellis has also worked with Humboldt State University&#8217;s Common Murre Restoration Project and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, contributing to long-term monitoring of seabirds at multiple breeding colonies in the Pacific. She carried out research and recovery efforts for endangered and threatened shorebirds as a crew leader for the U.S. Geological Survey&#8217;s Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center in North Dakota and for the nonprofit Conserve Wildlife Foundation New Jersey.

<p>Throughout her career, Aspen has taught students of all ages and performed outreach in the communities where she&#8217;s worked. As a student with a non-traditional education background, she is interested in finding creative ways to use outreach and pedagogical techniques to improve access to the sciences for students from historically excluded demographics.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6a4e21f680727046547eef6b7a53f4e3"><name>trademark-licensing-management</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz partners with CLC for trademark licensing management</title><summary>CLC is providing UC Santa Cruz with innovative tools and resources that enable vendors to offer a greater variety of high-quality merchandise with the UC Santa Cruz logo and mascot, expanding the overall reach of merchandise available in stores and online retailers. </summary><start-date>1659596400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz partners with CLC for trademark licensing management</display-name><path>/2022/08/trademark-licensing-management</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/trademark-licensing-management</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1659640881634</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1659641254452</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Sports</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/sammy-with-students-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/sammy-with-students-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sammy-with-students-500px.jpg</name><display-name>sammy-with-students-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>173068</file-size><width>500</width><height>648</height></image><image-alt>Sammy the Slug</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has named CLC, the nation&#8217;s leading collegiate trademark licensing agency, its exclusive trademark licensing representative, effective July 2022.</p>
<p>In its history, the UC Santa Cruz Banana Slug has been named the best college sports nickname and top 10 best college basketball mascots, as well as among the &#8220;craziest&#8221; and &#8220;weirdest&#8221; mascots in college sports. It has gained fascination and notoriety through films, television, and pop culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;People love UC Santa Cruz and our Banana Slug mascot,&#8221; said Dino Pollock, Senior Associate Director of Athletics, Compliance. &#8220;This new partnership will help to ensure our university and iconic mascot are appropriately represented and maintain their authentic appeal for generations to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>CLC is providing UC Santa Cruz with innovative tools and resources that enable vendors to offer a greater variety of high-quality merchandise with the UC Santa Cruz logo and mascot, expanding the overall reach of merchandise available in stores and online retailers.</p>
<p>CLC and UC Santa Cruz will together develop strategies and targeted marketing programs to reach students, alumni and supporters. Additionally, robust sales and market data will allow UC Santa Cruz to identify new areas for visibility through best-in-class product partnerships and retailers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to work with UC Santa Cruz to help amplify the university&#8217;s brand through insight and innovation as part of an overall customized licensing strategy,&#8221; said Cory Moss, CLC&#8217;s Executive Vice President and Managing Director. &#8220;Our CLC team is looking forward to delivering new products and marketing resources to grow the university&#8217;s licensing program and serve all UC Santa Cruz supporters.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="700c48128072704615fc5f315268f493"><name>president-drake-tours-campus</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>With a focus on student success and research impact,  UC President Michael V.

Drake and his wife, Mrs. Brenda Drake, visited UC Santa Cruz to learn more about the campus&#8217;s work on advancing the success of undergraduate and graduate students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daylong visit included meetings with faculty, staff, and students to learn more about research, teaching, and learning at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;and the important work that supports the university&#8217;s mission as a Hispanic-Serving research university centered on student success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was wonderful to visit UC Santa Cruz and hear about the latest achievements of the Banana Slug community,&#8221; Drake said. &#8220;I&#8217;m grateful for the campus&#8217;s leadership on so many issues, from social justice to climate change, and am looking forward to seeing all the progress to come.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Since his <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-welcomes-our-next-president-michael-v-drake-md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appointment in 2020 to lead the University of California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Drake has sought to tour each of the system&#8217;s 10 campuses, five medical centers, and three nationally affiliated labs. Drake has a long and distinguished career in higher education, including serving as chancellor of UC Irvine for nine years, from 2005 to 2014, and as the systemwide vice president for health affairs from 2000 to 2005. He served as president of The Ohio State University from 2014 until his return to UC. Drake was last on campus in May, delivering a speech at the dedication ceremony for John R. Lewis College.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was wonderful to have President Drake at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;While he&#8217;s visited before, this was an opportunity for him to more deeply interact with students, staff and faculty, and to learn about the intentional work we are doing to support and mentor diverse students pursuing degrees in science and engineering, to lead aquaculture into a more sustainable future, and to create spaces for student creativity and innovation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The July 29 visit began with an outdoor lunch at the Coastal Science Campus with undergraduates conducting research through STEM Diversity Research Programs. The programs promote diversity in the sciences by providing direct services that support students through STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) research training, professional development, and academic support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">STEM Diversity Programs Director Yulianna Ortega said it was wonderful to have candid conversations with Drake and Larive and to hear about their personal and professional journeys, experiences that resonate and inspire UCSC students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These interactions with leadership are very important for our students to have,&#8221; Ortega said, &#8220;because it empowers their sense of leadership and to see themselves as agents of change, shaping the very structural influences that determine their academic, personal, and professional lives.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there, Drake headed to the residential campus to see </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/07/state-funding-kresge.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">progress on the Kresge College renewal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The first phase, set to be completed in the coming academic year, includes new residential and academic buildings. When the expansive project is completed, it will include housing for approximately 970 undergraduates, about 600 more beds than what the college originally held.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At College Nine and John R. Lewis College, Drake thanked a team of employees who work in the campus dining halls. The group included some of the employees who have helped to serve and support students through both the pandemic and the wildfires in the summer of 2020 that led to a first-ever campus evacuation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have been dedicated to coming to campus every day to keep the campus moving and you&#8217;ve created the opportunity for our students to learn, for our faculty to teach and do their research, and for all of us to live,&#8221; Drake said. &#8220;You are the University of California.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drake met with a group of faculty members gathered on the lawn at the Cowell College Provost House. Through a conversation facilitated by Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning Director Jody Greene and Vice Chair of the Academic Senate Patty Gallagher, the faculty shared their challenges teaching and conducting research through the pandemic and their impactful work to improve their pedagogy to support learning equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuing the focus on teaching and learning, Drake met with students and professional staff who work in the campus libraries and talked about the library&#8217;s central role as a place for the campus community.</span></p>
<figure class="image"><img alt="library-740px.jpg" class="" height="266" src="../../library-740px.jpg" width="740"/>
<figcaption>UC President Michael V. Drake talked with students and professional staff in the library about the importance of creating spaces for students to create, collaborate and study.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Archivist Rebecca Hernandez asked Drake to share a memorable library experience. He offered three, sharing how the university library was where his son, leaving home for law school, met his future wife; how at Ohio State he participated in a discussion, held at the library, about the future of higher education; and how as a pre-med undergraduate at Stanford University he would study at the university&#8217;s art library, finding focus as he studied organic chemistry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversation expanded to focus on how libraries are transforming to be a space for students to collaborate with one another.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The library is a place to be yourself, and start creating things and interact with people,&#8221; said Sky Casey, an undergraduate student employee in the </span><a href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/DS/DSI/Home"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Scholarship Innovation Studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The space is designed to create a community and to democratize access to technology. The resources include tools, such as 3-D printers and laser cutters.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drake concluded his campus tour with a visit to the UC Santa Cruz Farm, where he learned about sustainable aquaculture and how the campus is working to support the basic needs of students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Studies Professor Anne Kapuscinski talked about her team&#8217;s work to make aquaculture more sustainable. As the world's appetite for fish increases, Kapuscinski is leading efforts to reduce the environmental impact of farmed fish. Her team is developing an ocean-friendly algae-based food for farmed fish. Many fish farms use fishmeal and fish oil extracted from wild fish like anchovies and sardines, putting those populations in jeopardy.</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With students Mary Ayanwale and Nessa Fakrai, Center for Agroecology Education and Research Specialist Tim Galarneau talked about innovative programs to meet students&#8217; basic needs, including the </span><a href="https://basicneeds.ucsc.edu/about/cowellcoffeeshop.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowell Coffee Shop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a non-transactional cafe and choice-based food pantry, and the </span><a href="https://basicneeds.ucsc.edu/about/cowellcoffeeshop.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CASFS Mobile Food Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 16-foot food trailer will serve lunch, distribute produce, and travel around campus to offer food at special events and workshops. The trailer will have a rotating menu that seeks to celebrate the diverse culinary diaspora of students and be rooted in the use of local, seasonal produce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We spend a lot of time thinking about the whole student,&#8221; said Center for Agroecology Education and Research Specialist Tim Galarneau, who also co-chairs the UC Systemwide Basic Needs Committee. &#8220;We are working to foster a supportive campus climate and a sense of belonging among students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From housing and basic needs to research opportunities and innovative teaching, Drake saw firsthand how the university is focused on supporting its students and making sure they have a transformative experience at UC Santa Cruz and are prepared for successful careers and meaningful lives after graduation.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7e1d432f807270461eecc4204d1f06d3"><name>campus-mpx-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Campus Update on Monkeypox</title><summary>The Student Health Center provides an update about monkeypox and our campus response and preparedness efforts.</summary><start-date>1659596400000</start-date><display-name>Campus Update on Monkeypox</display-name><path>/2022/08/campus-mpx-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/campus-mpx-update</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1659973223147</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1659973243752</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>To:</strong>&#160;UC Santa Cruz Community</p>
<p><strong>From:&#160;</strong>Gary Dunn, Ph.D., interim Associate Vice Chancellor, Student Health and Wellness, and Elizabeth Miller, D.O., Student Health Services Medical Director</p>
<p><strong>Subject:&#160;</strong>Campus update on Monkeypox</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear UC Santa Cruz community,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are writing to provide you with some information about </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/about.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monkeypox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and our campus response and preparedness efforts. On August 1, 2022, Governor Gavin Newsom </span><a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/08/01/74502/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared a State of Emergency to bolster California's vaccination efforts.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The proclamation will elevate the work underway by the California Department of Public Health and others in the administration. It will allow a fully coordinated response to monkeypox, for the state to lead outreach and education efforts, and access to additional vaccines and treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Student Health Services has partnered with local and state public health departments and has access to the vaccine (JYNNEOS) and antiviral (Tecovirimat (TPOXX)) treatments against monkeypox for students who are eligible.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, we are prioritizing the JYNNEOS vaccine for preventative use for students who are at high risk because they were notified of an exposure within the past 14 days and/or those who meet the following criteria:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presumed contacts who know that a sexual partner in the past 14 days was diagnosed with monkeypox.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had multiple sexual partners in the past 14 days in a </span><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Monkeypox-Data.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jurisdiction with known monkeypox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known close contacts who are identified by public health via case investigation, contact tracing, and risk exposure assessments.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TPOXX is an antiviral treatment option for those who have been diagnosed, or have lesions and a known contact with monkeypox but are not yet diagnosed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>If You Have Symptoms or Have Been Exposed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wear a mask and cover your rashes and sores until you get them checked by a medical provider as soon as possible.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a break from in-person gatherings, especially if they involve close, personal skin-to-skin contact. This includes sexual activity.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students who think they might meet the criteria for vaccination or have </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">symptoms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are advised to contact Student Health Services:</span><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nurse Advice Line:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (831) 459-2591</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://studenthealth.ucsc.edu/"><strong>Health e-Messenger</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> questions or concerns about risk, symptoms or exposure - Messages &gt; New Message &gt; Monkeypox Question</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff and faculty are advised to contact their health care provider or visit </span><a href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/Monkeypox.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz Health Services Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that hearing about another public health risk in our community can be concerning and encourage students to reach out to </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Health Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with any questions and to contact </span><a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CAPS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for mental health resources. Staff and faculty can reach out to the </span><a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee Assistance Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for free mental health support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that while the public health emergency designation will allow jurisdictions to allocate more resources, </span><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Monkeypox.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Department of Public Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states that the risk of monkeypox to the public is currently low. Being aware of the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">symptoms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/prevention.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to prevent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or treat the virus is an important step in educating ourselves and the UCSC campus community about monkeypox and the potential threat to public health. We will continue to monitor the situation closely in the days and weeks to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In community,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychology Professor Phil Hammack, director of the Sexual and Gender Diversity Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Cruz, led a study that combined survey data, interviews, and ethnographic field notes to compare mental health outcomes for LGBTQ+ youth across some of California&#8217;s most and least supportive communities for sexual and gender diversity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results showed remarkably little difference in outcomes between communities during the 2015 to 2017 study period. Overall, 41% of LGBTQ+ teens surveyed reported clinically-concerning levels of depressive symptoms, compared to a rate of 10% for those same symptoms among all California adolescents, as estimated by prior epidemiological studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was really surpring that the level of community support for sexual and gender diversity did not seem to make much of a difference for the mental health of these youth, because the communities we studied had such strikingly different levels of LGBTQ resources and visibility,&#8221; Hammack said. &#8220;When we first looked at our survey results, we were so shocked that we re-ran the analysis several times, just to be sure.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Stigma and mental health impacts extend across communities</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study focused in particular on comparing the Bay Area and California&#8217;s Central Valley, regions with higher and lower levels of support for sexual and gender diversity, according to an eight-factor community climate assessment conducted by the research team. Differences between the regions included the proportion of LGBTQ+ supportive businesses and religious and political affiliates, the proportion of same-sex households, and the availability of LGBTQ+ resources and celebrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team surveyed 314 teens across these regions to get a sense for how they perceived their community, the types of stigma and discrimination or support and belonging that they experienced, and the incidence of depressive symptoms. Survey findings were supplemented with depth and context from 28 interviews with regional LGBTQ+ youth leaders and observations from ethnographic field work in each community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings revealed that youth in the Bay Area did perceive their community as being more supportive of LGBTQ+ people, while youth in the Central Valley perceived their communities as less supportive. Youth in the Central Valley also reported experiencing more anti-LGBTQ+ remarks and feeling higher levels of stigma, while youth in the Bay Area felt more empowerment. But the statistically significant differences in youth outcomes ended there.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across communities, in addition to high rates of depressive symptoms, researchers found that 41% of all youth surveyed had experienced targeted victimization, such as bullying, around their LGBTQ+ identities, and 59% had experienced discrimination. Teens said they believed that bullying, internalized stigmatization, identity concealment, and fear of rejection were all contributing to depressive symptoms among young members of the LGBTQ+ community, and those symptoms often manifested in anxiety and depression, as well as self-harm.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The widespread nature of these challenges across communities is concerning from a public health perspective, Hammack says. For decades, researchers have been documenting a wide range of disparities in health outcomes between LGBTQ+ people, who face social stigma for their gender and sexual identities, and cisgender heterosexual people, who do not. Higher rates of mental health issues, like depression and stress, are linked with other health problems, like early mortality and cardiovascular disease.&#160;</span></p>
<h2>Uncovering possible causes and solutions</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The persistence of these disparities, despite significant efforts to address them in some communities, may signal a need for more systemic changes to support youth in Generation Z, who identify as members of the LGBTQ+ community at higher rates than any prior generation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our findings suggest that the health disparities we&#8217;ve been seeing for many years still remain for Gen Z, and a highly resourced community is not enough to buffer the negative impact of broader social stigma,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy to fall into an illusion of thinking that if we can just create a safe bubble in our community, then everything will be okay, but the reality is that we exist within a larger culture where oppressive, prejudicial ideas about gender and sexuality are still out there and, if anything, those ideas have been emboldened in recent years.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team also documented another trend, during in-depth interviews with LGBTQ+ teens, that may help to explain some of the lack of difference in mental health outcomes across communities. Youth perceptions of their community&#8217;s level of supportiveness seemed to affect expectations for what life would be like as an LGBTQ+ person in that community. Teens in lower-support communities had low expectations for how they would be treated and expressed optimism that things would get better, while teens in higher-support communities had high expectations that sometimes went unmet.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Teens in the Bay Area expected LGBTQ issues to be part of formal school curricula, and they expected teachers to get pronouns right, but teens in the Central Valley weren&#8217;t expecting those things, so they didn&#8217;t miss not having them as much,&#8221; Hammack explained. &#8220;This speaks to how experience translates into mental health through how we&#8217;re interpreting our environment and constructing our expectations. In this case, differing expectations may actually cancel out the effects of different levels of material support in these communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study did also uncover some community resources that teens found to be particularly helpful, including mental health services, online and in-person support resources, and peer social support. And teens recommended that mental health providers receive more cultural competence training around sexual and gender diversity. Many reported being disappointed with counselors who did not seem to understand LGBTQ+ identities or terminology. Hammack says continuing education for psychologists and psychiatrists could help to address that issue.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, though, he believes the study shows the importance of scaling up LGBTQ+ support efforts across society.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young people are looking to adults to change the culture,&#8221; Hammack said. &#8220;Teens have higher expectations of adults, schools, and society, and we&#8217;re not meeting them. It&#8217;s not just about small aspects of the local environment. We need a bigger sea change in our culture for stigma to be reduced. Otherwise, we&#8217;ll continue to see major mental health challenges and disparities.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7ed6fd4e807270461eecc420c9173ac2"><name>payroll-disclosure</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Courtesy notice regarding annual systemwide payroll disclosure</title><summary>As part of the university’s commitment to transparency and public accountability, including the way it compensates faculty and staff, UC is conducting its annual disclosure of systemwide employee compensation for calendar year 2021. </summary><start-date>1659942000000</start-date><path>/2022/08/payroll-disclosure</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/payroll-disclosure</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1659985394989</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1659985394989</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>As part of the university&#8217;s commitment to transparency and public accountability, including the way it compensates faculty and staff, UC is conducting its annual disclosure of systemwide employee compensation for calendar year 2021.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She will be a great addition to our campus community. Aisha is a thoughtful, collaborative leader who believes in empowering staff, and she arrives with a wealth of experience in higher education technology. Most recently she served as the University of Colorado Boulder&#8217;s first-ever Assistant Vice Provost and Assistant Vice Chancellor for Academic Technology and Student Success. That position was created to ensure the continual advancement of campus technology to serve both faculty and students. It was a unique role in that it bridged the academic and administrative sides of that university, with oversight of academic technology and student-success analytics, for example, as well as some administrative platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That experience will be especially helpful as Aisha leads our efforts to further align our Information Technology division with our campus goals of advancing student success; elevating our research profile and increasing the impact of our research; fostering an inclusive campus climate; and improving the efficiency, effectiveness, resilience, and sustainability of our operations. We have made great strides in this alignment work in recent years. I am confident that Aisha and our colleagues in the Division of Information Technology will continue to advance this important work for our campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aisha&#8217;s professional and educational background make her a strong fit for our campus. Aisha spent the past dozen years at CU Boulder, working in various director and manager positions in CU Boulder&#8217;s Office of Information Technology before transitioning to the Assistant Vice Provost and Assistant Vice Chancellor for Academic Technology and Student Success role. She began her career in information technology at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus, Trinidad and Tobago. She earned a doctorate in education from the University of Colorado, Denver; a master&#8217;s in education from the University of Florida, Gainesville; and a bachelor of arts in elementary education from Flagler College in Florida.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My sincere gratitude to interim Vice Chancellor for Information Technology Byron Walker, who has served as interim chief since last August. In that time, Byron has worked closely with leadership, faculty, staff and students across campus to continue our efforts to leverage technology in ways that support teaching and learning, research and discovery, and outreach. He is now serving as the Associate Vice Chancellor for Information Technology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength of our leadership team and the resilience of our campus community as a whole&#160; have helped us through the challenges of the past few years. Together we have created a strong foundation on which we will create an even brighter future. Aisha&#8217;s arrival makes us even stronger. Please join me in offering her a warm welcome!&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="840fa51280727046112e8132aa5c6f74"><name>county-fair-volunteers</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Employees invited to volunteer at UCSC booth at county fair</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz hopes to widen community awareness of its efforts to expand educational opportunity and access, to promote social equity, and to foster research excellence by staffing an educational booth at the upcoming Santa Cruz County Fair.</summary><start-date>1660028400000</start-date><path>/2022/08/county-fair-volunteers</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/county-fair-volunteers</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1660072994047</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1660072994047</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz hopes to widen community awareness of its efforts to expand educational opportunity and access, to promote social equity, and to foster research excellence by staffing an educational booth at the upcoming Santa Cruz County Fair. This year&#8217;s event is set for Sept. 14-18 at the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds in Watsonville. Historically, upward of 75,000 people attend the fair during its five-day run.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audries Blake, assistant director of community relations, is spearheading efforts to increase the university&#8217;s engagement countywide, with a particular focus on South County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tabling not only boosts our involvement in a fantastic local event, it&#8217;s an opportunity for us to let the community know about the many great things happening on campus,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re known internationally as a research powerhouse, and nationally as a campus that students chose because they want to make a difference in the world. We want to keep the community informed and to look for new ways that we can work together.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizers are seeking campus employees to participate by staffing the booth, which will be set up in the fair&#8217;s Educational Area. It&#8217;s expected that participants will greet community members, pass out educational materials about the campus, and give away free items to booth visitors. Volunteers will be asked to fill a two-hour shift. An </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kLpeEA-rCFurJGc8-z43HCMLtLTsiUeSqfvyA4lDuDk/edit?ts=62ed30fb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online signup sheet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been created. Pre-approval from a supervisor is required for shifts scheduled during the workday. Each participant will receive a parking pass and an entrance pass for the day they staff the booth. Anyone who works two or more shifts will receive a $25 gift card from the university for food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Zoom meeting will be held before the fair&#8217;s first day to give those who sign up an overview of the event, answer questions, and provide any last-minute updates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fair runs Sept. 14-18, from noon to 11 p.m. Wednesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday. For more information, email Audries Blake at arblake@ucsc.edu.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8449a29d80727046112e81328ed6eab5"><name>mpx-town-hall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Santa Cruz County Public Health hosts MPX town hall</title><summary>Santa Cruz County Public Health hosts MPX town hall Thursday, August 11 from 6 - 7 p.m..</summary><start-date>1660028400000</start-date><display-name>MPX Town Hall</display-name><path>/2022/08/mpx-town-hall</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/mpx-town-hall</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1660076794498</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1660076841587</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Santa Cruz County Public Health is hosting this town hall to encourage open discussion and share information about monkeypox (MPX).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus leaders are carefully managing student enrollment and working to provide more on-campus housing for students because of a statewide housing crisis that is particularly difficult in Santa Cruz. The incoming student cohort, which by design is 700 fewer from fall 2021, represents a vibrant mix of first-year and transfer students who will enhance the campus community through their varied experiences and perspectives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selected from more than 66,000 applicants, the class of first-year students is academically distinguished and economically and racially diverse, with a mean weighted high school GPA of 3.97. Approximately 36 percent will be the first in their family to attend a university and 40 percent are eligible to receive Pell grants, which indicates they are from low-income households.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These incoming students &#8212; both&#160; transfers and those who will be entering their first year at the college level &#8212; have shown themselves to be well-prepared, determined and resilient scholars,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;We are so excited to welcome them to our campus community to continue their academic journey.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s newest cohort joins a university on an unprecedented trajectory, with faculty pursuing research that is having a transformative impact on society. Reflecting the quality of the campus&#8217; research as well as graduate and undergraduate teaching, UCSC is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz shares the distinction of being the youngest member of the esteemed AAU, and is one of only six members that is also a Hispanic-serving institution. Reflecting national leadership in educational equity, UC Santa Cruz joined 21 other top universities in forming the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/alliance-hispanic-serving-research-universities.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance of Hispanic Serving Research Universities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The campus also is an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution. For the third year in a row, UC Santa Cruz was ranked among the top twenty universities nationally for student social mobility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undergraduate students at UC Santa Cruz experience a small liberal arts college environment with the depth and rigor of a major research university through the pairing of high-impact research with 10 tight-knit residential colleges &#8211; a rare combination among U.S. public universities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, UC Santa Cruz was named the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/princeton-public-impact.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. 2 public university in the nation for students focused on making an impact on the world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to Princeton Review. This ranking reinforces what students and alumni know: that UC Santa Cruz is a destination for those seeking to have an impact on society and to effect real change.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Advancing opportunity, access</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ongoing effort to ensure students know about the transformational opportunities available at UC Santa Cruz, the admissions team expanded its outreach efforts in high schools and community colleges. With another year of record applications, the faculty committee carefully assessed how to provide access to a high-quality and affordable UC education to a diverse cohort of highly qualified students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fall 2022, UC Santa Cruz extended an offer of admissions to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 31,000 high school seniors and 7,000 transfer students</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Close to 23,000 seniors and 6,500 transfer students</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were from California.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz extended admissions offers to 989 African American high school seniors from California and 6,878 Chicanx/Latinx California high school seniors. Offers to American Indian first year students increased to 130.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz continued regional and statewide outreach efforts to increase interest and applications from transfer students seeking a four-year degree. Having already completed considerable coursework, transfer students have demonstrated their ability to succeed academically, enter UCSC poised for timely graduation, and add valuable perspectives to the campus community. Providing access for California community college students is one of the highest priorities and further diversifies the campus community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In support of creating a learning environment that exemplifies cultural and geographic diversity, UC Santa Cruz admitted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 3,200 international first-year students and more than 4,800 first-year students from other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The broad diversity from California and other states and countries enhances the community through their varied experiences and perspectives and helps prepare students for successful careers in a global and globally-connected world.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Preparing for fall quarter</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fall instruction begins Sept. 22 with move-in starting Sept. 15. The campus will provide housing for about 9,300 students, more than half of the undergraduate class. An ambitious </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/07/state-funding-kresge.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">construction project underway at Kresge College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will increase the amount of campus housing available to undergraduate students, and campus leaders are developing&#160; a multi-year housing strategy with a project ladder that has projects in the planning, design or construction stage at all times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other University of California campuses, UC Santa Cruz is focused on supporting the health and well being of its campus community. With a widely vaccinated and boosted campus community and a successful COVID-19 testing program, UC Santa Cruz is planning for in-person instruction in the fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incoming students begin their studies during summer, in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s innovative 1-credit online Slug Orientation course. The course is designed to connect new students to academic and social resources, to meet critical campus deadlines, to provide guidance and support for enrolling in first-quarter classes, assist with navigating campus processes, and overall provide a smooth transitional experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of new students also got an early start to their UC Santa Cruz education through the Office of Summer Sessions&#8217; Summer Edge programs, offered this year in dual formats, for remote students and for students living and learning in Santa Cruz. Programs such as these significantly contribute to UC Santa Cruz&#8217; systemwide leadership in the percentage of first year students who complete their 4-year baccalaureate degree in just three years, most recently 1 in 12 students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incoming first year and sophomore students will participate in a robust Welcome Week intended to connect and engage students with each other and the campus. Welcome Week is a continuation of Slug Orientation, and is designed to further introduce new students to vital resources that will support them in their academic and social transition to the university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the required college and major advising presentations, new students will meet staff and faculty from their affiliated college and major. During this week students will have many opportunities to meet other students, learn about student clubs and organizations, and attend workshops that will connect them to work and internship opportunities.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="899a3e1b80727046752fe29090a18088"><name>justin-dipego</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Mythologizing for a purpose</title><summary>After years working across industries from filmmaking to horse-wrangling, alumnus Justin DiPego channels both his vast career experience and his UCSC creative education into his latest novel—"Wrong Side of a Workingman."</summary><start-date>1660201200000</start-date><display-name>justin-dipego</display-name><path>/2022/08/justin-dipego</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/justin-dipego</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1660165963257</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1660241917577</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Bayan Parrenas Shimizu</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/justindipegolede.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/justindipegolede.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>justindipegolede.jpg</name><display-name>justindipegolede.jpg</display-name><file-size>166433</file-size><width>366</width><height>528</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/justindipegothumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/justindipegothumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>justindipegothumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>justindipegothumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>10512</file-size><width>45</width><height>67</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Justin DiPego&#160;(Oakes &#8217;90, literature and creative writing).</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Before Justin DiPego (Oakes &#8217;90, literature, creative writing) began his careers as an editor, handyman, filmmaker, horse wrangler, screenwriter, or author, he was choosing colleges. After just one visit to UC Santa Cruz, he knew: &#8220;This is where I need to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>DiPego&#8217;s career path is a twisting one, beginning in the construction industry and horse-work, transitioning into a chief editorial position at a major home improvement magazine, becoming a writer-for-hire and then filmmaker. Following his exit from his editorial role in the corporate sphere, DiPego would then go on to start his own production company, DiPego Now Entertainment, where he wrote and directed multiple screenplays. For DiPego, the path of his foreseeable future was clear. However, DiPego&#8217;s path would quickly grow cloudy, with a world-defining obstacle suddenly appearing in his way: the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I decided to take up the reins of my own career, and instead of waiting for someone else to hire me, I was just going to go ahead and be my own production company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I started a production company called DiPego Now Entertainment. I already had a certain number of screenplays written specifically to be shot on a low budget and that I could handle myself. I was recruiting people to be a part of my organization and my team, and I had a movie that was getting a cast. And then the pandemic started.&#8221;</p>
<p>DiPego would need to halt his work mid-production and adjust to an entirely new world with the advent of the rapidly spreading virus. DiPego drastically pivoted from working mid-production to sheltering in place&#8211;and would find himself adjusting his path even further. Once it was clear his work on the film needed to wait, he unearthed another project from ten years ago: an urban fantasy novel, inspired by his experiences as a handyman working throughout LA.</p>
<p>DiPego has always held a great passion for writing. DiPego tracks his time as an author back to his family of writers, taking influence from his parents and siblings. During his time at UCSC, he found himself exposed to an entirely new world of creativity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was really fortuitous that I ended up exactly in the place where I needed because the setting on the hill in the redwoods completely spoke to me, but then also, the creative environment up there was so rich and welcoming,&#8221; DiPego said. &#8220;It was so easy to be an artist up there&#8211;and so I immediately found myself at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>DiPego credits UCSC&#8217;s environment for allowing students to produce their work, whether it was their best or their worst work. He recalls a specific moment when an instructor encouraged his dissenting opinions on class readings, wherein he transitioned from quiet observer to active participant.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all had the license to produce our worst work as artists, whether we were actors or writers or musicians or graphic art painters and sculptors because everything was happening,&#8221; DiPego said. &#8220;Everybody was kind of mixed. I was a creative writing major, but I was doing a lot of theater as well because everything artistically was very melded together. [...] It was all right there, which was fascinating, and so invigorating.&#8221;</p>
<p>DiPego&#8217;s written works focus on the perspectives of the hidden side of Los Angeles not often depicted in popular media&#8211;centering on narratives from disenfranchised workingmen or the thousands of homeless individuals in the city. DiPego&#8217;s focus on the working class in his work tracks back to his own time working as a handyman&#8211;a position where he recalls feeling invisible to most of the people that lived in the area, but gained access to a literal and metaphorical window into their lives. He was witness to dozens of stories that were normally hidden away, all of which influenced and inspired him in his work.</p>
<p>DiPego&#8217;s work has always sought to combine modern depictions of Los Angeles with the world of the supernatural in the genre of Urban Fantasy. However, to DiPego, this genre isn&#8217;t simply about the combination, but a continuation of the mythology that fantasy represents.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have been using [fantasy] as a storytelling vehicle for thousands of years, and that is the tradition that I wanted to take part in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The very earliest stories that we know are fantasy; the Epic of Gilgamesh is a work of fantasy&#8211;we talk about it as mythology now. But essentially it's the same genre. I wanted to participate in that kind of mythologizing for a purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>DiPego still utilizes his experience from the melding of the arts he was immersed in at UC Santa Cruz. When DiPego writes, he uses every form of media available to him, from illustrations integrated throughout his writing to musical references and playlists to accompany the reading. Just as DiPego was exposed to innumerable artistic disciplines during his time at UCSC, he now passes on that inter-artistic experience to his audiences.</p>

Yet, within only a few years, Schatz would find herself in a very different context: The New York Times Bestseller list for pioneering feminist children&#8217;s literature.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schatz spent her time at UCSC focusing on feminist studies and creative writing, two majors that flowed directly into her future work as a major feminist children&#8217;s author.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I very genuinely feel like my UC Santa Cruz education is the foundation of much of the work that I do,&#8221; Schatz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the prospects of her studies didn&#8217;t always seem to connect to the future. She recalls a time when much of her family&#8211;though supportive&#8211;looked onto her studies with confusion. In spite of her family&#8217;s questioning, Schatz knew the value of a feminist studies education, and would carry that understanding with her in understanding the world as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was in my feminist studies classes, that I came to understand economics, and then I came to really think about history in a different way. I understood I learned a lot about psychology. I learned about literature in a very different way. For me, it was just this, it was an intellectual lens that went over all of these different fields.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schatz's latest book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do the Work! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-written with comedian and television host W. Kamau Bell, focuses on bringing the lessons Schatz shared in her children&#8217;s book series </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rad Women</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to an adult audience by using an interactive medium&#8211;an activity book. By using a more interactive approach, Schatz aims to directly engage her readers with anti-racism, and turn awareness into action.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The book is called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do the Work</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the whole point is that you just need to do </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">something</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Schatz said. &#8220;Change doesn't happen if you're just sitting around worrying,fretting, freaking out, or just posting on social media&#8212;you need to figure out something to do, and there's so many different things we can do. So why not create a book where you learn about that while actually doing things?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schatz began her foray into children&#8217;s literature as her time protesting in the streets came to an end, with new circumstances preventing her from participating in activism as she once did. Though she began her career with short stories after pursuing an MFA in creative writing, Schatz recalls always wanting to write a children&#8217;s book &#8211; and a few years into parenthood, Schatz would find the perfect reason to fulfill that desire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I had the idea for [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rad Women</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">], my daughter was two: it was also a time when I felt my experience and identity as an activist was in a transitional time,&#8221; Schatz said. &#8220;As a new mom, I wasn't as able or willing to go out to protests to be in the streets, risking arrest as I had before. I had a baby at home, and I felt a shift that I wanted to be impactful, but in a different way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schatz published her first book of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rad Women</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rad American Women A-Z</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in 2015, which would win itself a place on the New York Times bestseller list and place feminist history in the minds of children across the nation. With Schatz&#8217;s transition from street activist to feminist author, she would move her activism from the physical world to the mental one, and went on to publish numerous other works in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rad Women</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series, writing on women worldwide and throughout American history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years as an influential feminist activist, Schatz still traces back the formation of her feminist understanding to Bettina Aptheker's course &#8220;Intro to Feminism,&#8221; which she took in her first quarter at UCSC. She recalls how much of her understanding of feminist theory came from that class, shaping the very lens with which she understands the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I got such a thorough understanding of intersectionality at such an early age, and an understanding of a lot of concepts that are at the heart of a lot of white women's anxieties about race, privilege, and all these things that make people tense up and get really defensive,&#8221; Schatz says, &#8220;I really feel like I encountered those things at such a young age at Santa Cruz, and was able to process them, understand them and move on intellectually&#8211;and that formed the basis of thought for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schatz now spreads these same lessons around the world through her writing, teaching her wide audience about the same structures of power and privilege she grew to understand at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>

This software is open source, allowing public health officials to use it to track instances of recombination within their communities.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recombination occurs when two genetically distinct forms of the virus hybridize. This study focused on detectable recombination, when the hybridization results in a sequence that is genetically new, and not on instances where two sequences combine to form a sequence identical to an already existing one.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It's really important for reconstructing the virus&#8217;s evolutionary history,&#8221; said Russell Corbett-Detig, senior author on the study and an associate professor of biomolecular engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;When there's recombination it's not one tree, it's many trees, and being able to trace that accurately is really crucial for understanding evolution of the virus.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Findings on recombination </strong>&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The researchers analyzed 1.6 million samples of COVID-19 and found 589 recombination events, which indicates that only about 2.7% of sequenced genomes result from recombination. These sequences were sourced from the UC Santa Cruz SARS-CoV-2 Browser, a repository for COVID-19 genomic data, which is now the largest collection of genomic sequences of a single species ever assembled, currently at nearly 12 million sequences.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While results show that recombination occurs more frequently in the spike protein region, it is not yet known why this is. This could potentially be the result of a mechanistic bias, indicating it is the natural tendency of all coronaviruses to recombine toward the three-prime region of the viral genome, which contains the spike protein, or that positive natural selection for COVID-19 is favoring recombinants that occur in this region.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While recombination does occur, there is no evidence that the resulting strains are more likely to be epidemiologically important. In fact, most recombinant variants die out, as do most of the thousands of mutated variants of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A new software, written primarily by UC San Diego Assistant Professor Yatish Turakhia during his postdoctoral training in Corbett-Detig&#8217;s lab, enabled the computational feat required for the analysis of millions of genomes. The software, called Recombination Inference using Phylogenetic PLacEmentS (RIPPLES), can efficiently search a massive phylogenetic tree of COVID-19 genomes to find instances where a new sequence appears to be a combination of two distinct sections of the tree. The COVID-19 phylogenetic tree, <a href="../04/usher-covid-tool.xml"><span class="s2">called UShER</span><span class="s3">,</span></a> was created by UCSC researchers and is the primary tool used by health officials worldwide to track the spread of variants in their community.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The researchers found recombination most often shows up on the COVID-19 phylogenetic tree in the form of &#8220;long branches,&#8221; making it appear that several mutations happened sequentially, which is quite rare.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;In a tree of millions of sequences, you find these long branches, which reduce the possible instances of detectable recombination down to only about 10&#8217;s of thousands of branches,&#8221; Turakhia said. &#8220;These long branches make recombination much easier to spot on the tree, which enables the efficient performance of the new software.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Turakhia and his team aim to continue to improve RIPPLES&#8217; speed and performance and to create visual tools to make it more accessible for a wider audience.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Use for public health</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Knowing when recombination occurs is crucial for understanding the evolutionary lineage of a sequence of the virus. Recombination can complicate the process of tracing back the phylogenetic tree of a particular sequence because its genetic material is a result of two joining areas of the overall COVID-19 family tree.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This can help public officials understand when a lineage of COVID-19 which appears to be novel is truly an independent mutation introduced for the first time, or rather just a combination of two lineages that already existed in the community. Understanding when recombination occurs is also important from a public health perspective as it can potentially make the virus more adept at evading immunity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, the RIPPLES software&#8217;s availability and ease of use has positive implications for genomics experts and public health officials alike, who can efficiently search a set of COVID-19 genomic samples for recombination in just minutes.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This reflects a larger theme of the work of scalable translation of pathogen genomics data at Corbett-Detig&#8217;s lab and the UCSC Genomics Institute. Researchers are focused on creating tools that enable public health officials to automate and translate the questions they want to ask, and receive answers that are easy to act on and dependable.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;A big part of the success of our work has been that the software is extremely accessible and computationally cheap in the grand scheme of things,&#8221; Corbett-Detig said. &#8220;Anybody could take their hundred new SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and figure out if there were potentially recombinant samples in just minutes on a basic laptop. Global public health needs to be democratized, to the point that anyone can do it, even if they're not a super wealthy lab with giant servers.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8ed90c8e8072704604a19b3fc8634210"><name>sanchez-acs-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Biochemist Laura Sanchez wins ACS Infectious Diseases Young Investigator Award</title><summary>Laura Sanchez, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC, has been chosen to receive the 2022 ACS Infectious Diseases Young Investigator Award.</summary><start-date>1660201200000</start-date><display-name>Biochemist Laura Sanchez wins ACS Infectious Diseases Young Investigator Award</display-name><path>/2022/08/sanchez-acs-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/sanchez-acs-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1660253965435</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1660254086060</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/laura-sanchez-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/laura-sanchez-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>laura-sanchez-300.jpg</name><display-name>laura-sanchez-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>64142</file-size><width>300</width><height>349</height></image><image-alt>Laura Sanchez</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/laura-sanchez-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/laura-sanchez-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>laura-sanchez-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>laura-sanchez-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17055</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Laura Sanchez</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Laura Sanchez</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Laura Sanchez, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, has been chosen to receive the 2022 <a href="https://axial.acs.org/2022/08/11/meet-the-winners-of-the-2022-acs-infectious-diseases-young-investigator-awards/">ACS Infectious Diseases Young Investigator Award</a>.

Drake has appointed Bruce Macintosh director of <a href="https://www.ucobservatories.org/">UC Observatories</a> (UCO), an astronomical research unit headquartered at UC Santa Cruz and serving nine UC campuses. Macintosh, currently at Stanford University, will begin his five-year term September 1, 2022, and will join the UC Santa Cruz faculty as a professor of astronomy and astrophysics.</p>
<p>As director, Macintosh will oversee UC&#8217;s nationally and internationally renowned astronomical ecosystem that includes the Lick Observatory, the technical laboratories at UC Santa Cruz and UCLA, and UC&#8217;s partnership role in the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawai&#8217;i.</p>
<p>Macintosh replaces Claire Max, professor emerita of astronomy and astrophysics, who retired in 2021 after leading UCO for seven years. Constance Rockosi, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, has served as interim director since July 2021.</p>
<p>Macintosh has spent the past nine years as professor of physics at Stanford University and has served as deputy director of its Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology since 2018. An accomplished scholar, Macintosh has made significant contributions to science as principal investigator on numerous research grants for NASA, the National Science Foundation, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where he served prior to his post at Stanford.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an exciting opportunity for the University and UC Observatories,&#8221; said President Drake. &#8220;Dr. Macintosh&#8217;s scientific expertise and research are at the forefront of our nation&#8217;s efforts to understand the cosmos. His commitment to diversity and his focus on groundbreaking research align with the University&#8217;s values, and they will strengthen our faculty research, expand our student experience, and take our prestigious program to even greater heights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macintosh&#8217;s research centers on the study of extrasolar planets (also called exoplanets)&#8212;in particular, examining such planets through direct imaging and adaptive optics. Among his many accomplishments, he co-led the team that produced the first images of a system of exoplanets. He led the international collaboration that produced the Gemini Planet Imager, deployed to the Gemini South Telescope, which led to the identification of new exoplanets and advanced the study of planet formation. In addition, he directed a science investigation team for the coronagraph instrument on NASA&#8217;s Nancy Grace Roman mission. He has served on multiple National Academy of Sciences committees on astrophysics strategy, including the Astro2020 Decadal Survey.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Observatories is one of the crown jewels of the University of California, and I am incredibly excited to have the privilege to lead this extraordinary multicampus program,&#8221; Macintosh said. &#8220;The telescopes we support are powerful tools for discovery, and astronomers at UC have done amazing things with them. In the next decade there are incredible scientific opportunities, and I look forward to working to continue UCO&#8217;s excellence and expand its impact on UC students, faculty, and scholarship in astronomy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macintosh, who earned his Ph.D. in astronomy at UCLA, strongly believes in making the fields of astronomy and physics more inclusive, diverse, and supportive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Macintosh is well-poised to lead the diverse components that comprise UCO&#8217;s mission,&#8221; said Theresa Maldonado, UC vice president for research and innovation. &#8220;His expertise and leadership will continue to advance UCO astronomy on the international stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macintosh was selected after an extensive national search, launched by Maldonado and chaired by Beth Willman, deputy director of NOIRLab. The search committee included experienced astronomers and administrators from UC campuses and affiliate national labs and organizations.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8f6e70e68072704604a19b3f4d8ad138"><name>center-for-agroecology-darryl-wong</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Envisioning food systems change with new Center for Agroecology Executive Director Darryl Wong</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz news team interviewed the Center for Agroecology's new executive director, Darryl Wong, to learn more about the center’s goals for the future and the perspective he’ll bring to the role. </summary><start-date>1660201200000</start-date><path>/2022/08/center-for-agroecology-darryl-wong</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/center-for-agroecology-darryl-wong</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1660263755980</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1660264171351</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Research</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/wong-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/wong-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wong-250.jpg</name><display-name>wong-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>69023</file-size><width>250</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Headshot of Darryl Wong</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/wong-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/wong-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wong-80.jpg</name><display-name>wong-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>24260</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Headshot of Darryl Wong</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Darryl Wong, new executive director of the Center for Agroecology at UC Santa Cruz.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/wong-students-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/wong-students-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wong-students-400.jpg</name><display-name>wong-students-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>77692</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>A group of people sit and talk in a farm field, with a tractor and ocean in the background</image-alt><image-caption>Wong (right) talks with students at the UCSC Farm. Photo: Jim Clark</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year UC Santa Cruz celebrates 55 years of national leadership in organic and sustainable agriculture, and the campus hub for those efforts, the </span><a href="https://agroecology.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Agroecology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is gearing up to expand its impact even further. The center recently selected Executive Director Darryl Wong to provide administrative and strategic leadership in support of the center&#8217;s mission to advance agroecology and build an equitable future for food systems. His work will complement Faculty Director Stacy Philpott&#8217;s continued oversight of the center&#8217;s academic and research functions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wong has been the Research Lands manager at the Center for Agroecology since 2013, which has allowed him to work across the center's food production, education, and research programs. He&#8217;s an alumnus of the center&#8217;s </span><a href="https://agroecology.ucsc.edu/education/apprenticeship/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apprenticeship program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is completing a Ph.D. in Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz, with a focus on soil health and organic no-till agriculture. He owned a diversified organic farm before joining the Center for Agroecology and has more than 15 years of farming experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Wong steps into his new role, the Center for Agroecology is poised to help shape the future of global food systems, amidst new challenges and opportunities emerging from rapid social, environmental, and technological change. The center will also continue to draw upon its history as perhaps the oldest university-based organic farm in the country. And the team remains committed to core services, including food access for students and the community, experiential education through the UCSC </span><a href="https://catalog.ucsc.edu/en/Current/General-Catalog/Academic-Units/Social-Sciences-Division/Environmental-Studies/Agroecology-BA/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agroecology major</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and apprenticeship program, extension services for farmers, and cutting-edge research on sustainable agriculture.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz news team connected with Wong to learn more about the center&#8217;s goals for the future and the perspective he&#8217;ll bring as executive director. Below are highlights from that interview.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>UCSC: </strong><em>Congratulations on your new position, Darryl. How are you feeling about stepping into the executive director role at the Center for Agroecology?<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wong:</strong> I&#8217;m really excited! I sometimes joke that I&#8217;ve experienced the center from just about every angle that you can, and one of the things that feels so exciting to me is to be able to share with others how impactful the Center for Agroecology and the UC Santa Cruz Farm and Alan Chadwick Garden can be, as someone who has had a really deep and grounded experience with it myself. I&#8217;m really looking forward to the challenge of thinking about how all of the center&#8217;s programs and resources can fit together to maximize our impact on food systems.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>UCSC: </strong><em>As the former research lands manager for the center, how do you see the legacy of organic farming on campus reflected in the types of research taking place here today?&#160;&#160;</em>&#160;&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wong:</strong> The Center for Agroecology is really unique in that we have a long history of food production that has had research layered on top of it. The fact that we maintain a functioning organic farm and garden right here on campus allows for a next level of research that combines aspects of technical, natural, and biophysical sciences to understand these lands as whole systems. That&#8217;s different from the approach you&#8217;ll see in agricultural sciences, which is often focused on constituent parts. Our research lands are more like a petri dish that allows folks to study the relationships at work in agricultural systems. And that includes the relationships between people and the land. The center&#8217;s work couples highly technical agricultural research with a broader focus on the social issues that go hand-in-hand with that.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>UCSC: </strong><em>Could you talk a little bit more about the social aspects of agroecology and how this informs the center&#8217;s work?&#160;</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wong:</strong> Well, when people talk about sustainable agriculture, they're usually thinking about organic production methods, or strategies like no-till farming or cover-cropping or nitrogen cycling. And there&#8217;s certainly a lot left to learn and discover about sustainable production methods. But also, with some of these things, we are now beyond the point of needing to prove that they work: we know that they can. Now we need to figure out which levers to lean on to push forward social change in transforming food systems to more sustainable forms of production and distribution and more equitable access and labor practices. Because, ultimately, there are social issues in agriculture that dictate the biophysical realities on the ground.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, growers are often limited in what they can do by societal decisions about how we value food and land. That&#8217;s reflected in how much consumers are willing to pay, what regulations exist around things like pesticides, how the market rewards consolidation, and how commodity supports for conventional produce bring prices down for all food. As a farmer, I ran up against some of those stark political economic realities myself. And that&#8217;s part of what drew me to the Center for Agroecology. UC Santa Cruz has long been a leader in the interdisciplinary study of food systems, and the center&#8217;s work pairs cutting-edge organic farming practices with insights on societal forces in agriculture in a way that is really unique and powerful.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>UCSC: </strong><em>And how does the educational mission of the center contribute to food systems change?</em>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wong:</strong> If you look back at the history, in the early days, the farm here at UC Santa Cruz was one of the only games around that gathered folks who were clued in to organic farming and agroecology principles. And part of the role that our campus played was offering practical training and curriculum, but there was also a community-building aspect that has been really important. The people who came to study agroecology at UC Santa Cruz were early adopters who made connections with each other that they kept with them as they moved on in their careers. And today, when you look across the country at the graduates of our apprenticeship program, our former students, and our early faculty members, you can really see how there&#8217;s a web of support helping to grow this movement that leads right back to UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, I think our goal is really to train the next generation of scientists and activists who can speak across the food system with both broad social understanding and real-world experience. I&#8217;m not expecting that everybody who comes through the agroecology major or the apprenticeship program wants to start a farm and drive a tractor. They could end up being someone who&#8217;s doing state policy work in Sacramento who's fired up about accessibility in agriculture and knows how much work it takes to harvest a strawberry. When someone talks to them about the issues facing strawberry workers in the field, they will have experiential knowledge in their fingertips and in their backs of how hard that work is and what people are asked to do to produce that crop.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>UCSC: </strong><em>What other essential issues will the center tackle to advance its mission into the future?&#160;</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wong:</strong> We&#8217;re thinking a lot about who can access the center and the educational opportunities that are here and how we can provide the right formats and support to connect this resource that has been so impactful in the food system with traditionally underserved populations that haven&#8217;t had access to it before. This is especially important in a time when there are so many new tools emerging in agriculture through the development of AgTech. When you give someone a tool, what they do with it is going to depend very much on the perspective they&#8217;re coming from, so we really need to be putting new technologies into the hands of people like farm workers and their families, who have deep lived experience with agriculture, to see where they will take it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think there&#8217;s potential for UC Santa Cruz to play a role in making those connections happen. We need to understand the implications of emerging technologies and access to technology and who gets to be at the table when it's being developed. Someone needs to ensure that those questions are being asked. And I think, as a campus, we&#8217;re uniquely well-positioned to help do that, given the strengths of both our engineering and social sciences programs. I think there&#8217;s a real opportunity to ensure that emerging agricultural technology doesn&#8217;t steamroll people, as it sometimes has in the past, and that AgTech can instead be an example of tech for social good. I&#8217;m excited to see what role the Center for Agroecology can play in that process.&#160; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="92a585f580727046032c71465cb2923f"><name>gilliam-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC graduate student wins HHMI Gilliam Fellowship for Advanced Study</title><summary>Gilliam Fellowships support exceptional graduate students and their advisers who are committed to increasing diversity among scientific leaders.</summary><keywords>Vanessa Mariscal, Fitnat Yildiz, Seth Rubin</keywords><start-date>1660287600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC graduate student wins HHMI Gilliam Fellowship for Advanced Study</display-name><path>/2022/08/gilliam-fellow</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/gilliam-fellow</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1660317697499</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1660323231536</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value><value>Environmental Toxicology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/yildiz-mariscal-rubin-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/yildiz-mariscal-rubin-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yildiz-mariscal-rubin-400.jpg</name><display-name>yildiz-mariscal-rubin-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>137989</file-size><width>400</width><height>483</height></image><image-alt>Vanessa Mariscal, Fitnat Yildiz, Seth Rubin</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/vanessa-mariscal-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/vanessa-mariscal-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>vanessa-mariscal-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>vanessa-mariscal-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20855</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Vanessa Mariscal</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Graduate student Vanessa Mariscal (center) with her thesis advisers Fitnat Yildiz and Seth Rubin.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Gilliam Fellowships support exceptional graduate students and their advisers who are committed to increasing diversity among scientific leaders</article-subhead><article-text><p>The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) has awarded a prestigious Gilliam Fellowship for Advanced Study to UC Santa Cruz graduate student Vanessa Mariscal. The Gilliam Fellowship program provides awards to graduate students conducting outstanding research in their scientific fields and their advisers who are committed to building a more inclusive scientific ecosystem.</p>
<p>Mariscal is working with Fitnat Yildiz, professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology, and Seth Rubin, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, to study biofilm formation in the bacteria that cause cholera. Biofilm formation enhances environmental survival and infectivity of the cholera bacteria <em>(Vibrio cholerae)</em>. The aims of Mariscal&#8217;s research are to understand the molecular signaling mechanisms involved in the regulation of biofilm formation, and to identify potential targets for inhibitors to disrupt biofilm formation.</p>
<p>Mariscal got interested in microbiology and biofilms as an undergraduate at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where she earned her B.S. in biological sciences and microbiology. She came to UC Santa Cruz in 2020 and was excited to work on biofilms in the Yildiz lab. Yildiz suggested she spend some time in Rubin&#8217;s lab learning techniques for working with proteins, and they are now both advising Mariscal on her thesis research.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are both amazing mentors and are very passionate about their research, and I&#8217;m enjoying working with them,&#8221; Mariscal said. &#8220;Being co-mentored has provided me with the opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and learn biochemical methods and principles that complement the bacterial genetics research conducted in the Yildiz lab.&#8221;</p>
<p>HHMI recognizes that the advisers of Gilliam Fellows play an important role in helping the students realize their high potential. The Gilliam Program invests in graduate students from populations historically excluded and underrepresented in science so that they are prepared to become scientific leaders.</p>
<p>Becoming part of a diverse, supportive, and strong community of scholars is an important aspect of the program. Gilliam Fellows attend an annual meeting and participate in HHMI leadership training, which gives them tools to use their strengths and experiences to the benefit of science, to influence the environment, maximize their collaborations, and elevate their voices as scientific leaders.</p>
<p>"It&#8217;s an incredible opportunity to meet other scientists from underrepresented groups in STEM and to build a supportive network,&#8221; Mariscal said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very welcoming community, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the leadership trainings and meetings we have coming up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Gilliam Fellows receive an annual award totaling $53,000 for up to three years.</p>
<p>&#8220;To support the development of these students as future scientific leaders, it&#8217;s crucial to provide high-quality mentoring, financial support, an inclusive lab environment, and a supportive community,&#8221; said David Asai, senior director for science education at HHMI. &#8220;True change will not happen on campuses without the support and commitment of faculty and institutional leaders.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="934d02f480727046032c71462a50526d"><name>shadow-scientist</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Lenses and Mirrors-Shadow the Scientists receives Heising-Simons Foundation grant</title><summary>Kickstarted by UC Santa Cruz Astronomy and Astrophysics Professor Raja GuhaThakurta, Lenses and Mirrors–Shadow the Scientists brings cutting-edge scientific research to anybody’s computer screen. </summary><start-date>1660546800000</start-date><display-name>shadow-scientist</display-name><path>/2022/08/shadow-scientist</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/shadow-scientist</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1660328674008</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1660664316067</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Haneen Zain</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/stslede.png</path><link>site://news/2022/stslede.png</link><site>news</site><name>stslede.png</name><display-name>stslede.png</display-name><file-size>247584</file-size><width>500</width><height>498</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/ststhumbnail.png</path><link>site://news/2022/ststhumbnail.png</link><site>news</site><name>ststhumbnail.png</name><display-name>ststhumbnail.png</display-name><file-size>17344</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shadow the Scientists logo.</span></p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/stssecondary.png</path><link>site://news/2022/stssecondary.png</link><site>news</site><name>stssecondary.png</name><display-name>stssecondary.png</display-name><file-size>146669</file-size><width>500</width><height>308</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Astronomy and Astrophysics Professor Raja GuhaThakurta shares observations from Keck Observatory at July 9 Shadow the Scientists session via Zoom.&#160;</span></p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lens and Mirrors&#8212;</span><a href="https://shadow.ucsc.edu/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shadow the Scientists (StS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started as a way to connect the public with on-the-ground scientific experiments amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The program quickly became a unique global initiative making cutting-edge astronomical and scientific research accessible to anyone, anywhere.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with an over $700k grant from the Heising-Simons Foundation, StS will have an increased opportunity to make a lasting impact globally.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">StS has strong partnerships with large networks of Indigenous and other marginalized student and educator groups in Hawai&#699;i, continental US, Mexico, Australia, and several countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe/Middle East, and Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are very excited to support the expansion of the Shadow the Scientists program,&#8221; Emily Schaller with the Heising-Simons Foundation said. &#8220;This global initiative offers students, teachers, and the public a unique window into the world of professional astronomers in real-time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early into the COVID-19 pandemic, observatories nationwide shut down in-person observation but, using Zoom and virtual network computing, astronomers were able to observe on telescopes from home, a method of observing dubbed &#8220;pajama mode.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accessibility of &#8220;pajama mode&#8221; observing inspired UC Santa Cruz Astronomy and Astrophysics Professor and Department Chair Raja GuhaThakurta to bring cutting-edge scientific research to anybody&#8217;s computer screen.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shadow the Scientists is a lens for people who are not involved in science to look through a scientist&#8217;s lens,&#8221; GuhaThakurta said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a figurative lens, but it&#8217;s also a mirror because, in it, you find out more about yourself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GuhaThakurta kickstarted StS in partnership with professor Roy Gal from the University of Hawai&#8217;i Institute for Astronomy and Dr. Brian Lemaux from the NOIRLab and Gemini-North Observatory in 2020. So far, StS has utilized the twin 10-m telescopes from the W.M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawai&#699;i, the Shane 3-m telescope from the Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton California, and the Subaru 8-m telescope on Mauna Kea. GuhaThakurta said the plan is to expand StS to other telescopes around the U.S. and the rest of the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">StS immerses participants in an authentic scientific research experience over Zoom with non-curated content. Participating students and educators connect with real-life scientists and engineers, watch them problem solve, understand what they are passionate about, and hear about their academic and career paths. StS participants also learn about the underlying science and the technical aspects of the research equipment, like telescopes, spectrographs, and cameras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In experimental science, it&#8217;s not just about sitting behind your computer and answering emails,&#8221; GuhaThakurta said. &#8220;It&#8217;s also about the doing of the experiment, and if you&#8217;re an astronomer, it&#8217;s about being at the telescope. So Shadow the Scientists is meant to be an authentic view into scientists&#8217; work, but specifically into the portion of the scientist&#8217;s work where they&#8217;re experiencing one of these moments where they&#8217;re at the telescope collecting data.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With funds from the Heising-Simons Foundation grant, GuhaThakurta and Assistant Director Sierra Schneider look forward to expanding StS&#8217;s staff and increasing the volume of events.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whenever we talk with potential donors, they ask, &#8216;what do you need?&#8217; and we always say &#8216;more hours in the day and funding to do this work,&#8217;&#8221; Schneider said. &#8220;And this grant funds people who have the time to dedicate to [Shadow the Scientists] and to have more scientists and shadowers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GuhaThakurta and Schneider emphasized that StS isn&#8217;t just limited to astronomy; the initiative has also engaged with research in other fields such as oceanography, robotics, biology, and more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At the beginning of the pandemic, there were so many people that were doing things on Zoom who never really considered doing it that way before, and the second you do anything on Zoom, you have the capacity for people to join from anywhere in the world,&#8221; Schneider said. &#8220;And so part of the reason it&#8217;s &#8216;Shadow the Scientists&#8217; instead of &#8216;Shadow the Astronomer&#8217; is because there&#8217;s so much more opportunity there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">StS at UCSC also works in partnership with the Native Skywatchers/We are Stardust initiative, who will receive a separate but related portion of the Heising-Simons Foundation grant. Founded by Annette S. Lee in 2007 and based at Arizona State University, the initiative aims to improve educational inequities for native young people, inspire increased cultural pride, and promote community wellness.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native Skywakers/We are Stardust&#8217;s overall goal is to communicate traditional indigenous sustainable practices through a living and participatory relationship with the above and below, sky and earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have attended several Shadow the Scientists observing sessions myself and have been incredibly impressed with the level of engagement that the students, educators, and parents had with the astronomers and observatory staff,&#8221; Emily Schaller with the Heising-Simons Foundation said. &#8220;We are excited for thousands of students to have the opportunity to participate in astronomical observing sessions over the coming years, including many from indigenous communities who will participate as part of the Native Skywatchers/We Are Stardust program.&#8221;</span></p>

The compound is ultra-bright and extremely common in protoplanetary disks&#8212;regions of dust and gas where planets form around young stars&#8212;making it a prime target for scientists.</p>
<p>But for the last decade or so, something hasn&#8217;t been adding up when it comes to carbon monoxide observations. A huge chunk of carbon monoxide is missing in all observations of disks, if astronomers&#8217; current predictions of its abundance are correct.</p>
<p>A solution to the mystery has now emerged from an interdisciplinary collaboration at UC Santa Cruz led by Diana Powell, who earned her Ph.D. in astrophysics at UCSC in 2021 and is now a NASA Hubble Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian.</p>
<p>Working with Ruth Murray-Clay, the Gunderson Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics at UCSC, and Xi Zhang, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences, Powell developed a new model indicating that carbon monoxide has been hiding in ice formations within the planet-forming disks. The model&#8217;s predictions were validated by observations from the ALMA radio observatory, and the team has reported its findings in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01741-9">paper published August 22 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This may be one of the biggest unsolved problems in planet-forming disks,&#8221; said Powell. &#8220;Depending on the system observed, carbon monoxide is three to 100 times less than it should be; it&#8217;s off by a really huge amount.&#8221;</p>
<p>And carbon monoxide inaccuracies could have huge implications for the field of astrochemistry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carbon monoxide is essentially used to trace everything we know about disks&#8212;like mass, composition, and temperature,&#8221; Powell explained. &#8220;This could mean many of our results for disks have been biased and uncertain because we don&#8217;t understand the compound well enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a graduate student at UCSC, Powell was studying planet formation in protoplanetary disks with Murray-Clay, and in a separate project with Zhang she was studying cloud physics in planetary atmospheres. Her work in these two areas inspired her to apply a modeling approach used in cloud physics to understand the formation of ice particles in planet-forming disks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ices are very important building blocks of the planets,&#8221; Zhang explained.</p>
<p>Powell made alterations to an astrophysical model used to study clouds on exoplanets, or planets beyond our solar system.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s really special about this model is that it has detailed physics for how ice forms on particles,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So how ice nucleates onto small particles and then how it condenses. The model carefully tracks where ice is, what particle it&#8217;s located on, how big the particles are, how small they are, and then how they move around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell applied the adapted model to planetary disks, hoping to generate an in-depth understanding of how carbon monoxide evolves over time in planetary nurseries. To test the model&#8217;s validity, Powell then compared its output to real ALMA observations of carbon monoxide in four well-studied disks&#8212;TW Hya, HD 163296, DM Tau and IM Lup.</p>
<p>The new model lined up with each of the observations, showing that the four disks weren&#8217;t actually missing carbon monoxide at all &#8212; it had just morphed into ice, which is currently undetectable with a telescope.</p>
<p>Murray-Clay said the new results are an inspiring example of the interdisciplinary approach fostered by UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://astrobiology.science.ucsc.edu/">Astrobiology Initiative</a>. &#8220;This was the culmination of Diana bringing insights from cloud physics together with our work on protoplanetary disks, and it came together in this beautiful and unexpected outcome,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me it was a surprise that the very small-scale microphysics of these ice particles has such a large-scale impact that its effects can be detected from light-years away in observations of protoplanetary disks,&#8221; Zhang added.</p>
<p>Radio observatories like ALMA allow astronomers to view carbon monoxide in space in its gas phase, but ice is much harder to detect with current technology, especially large formations of ice, Powell said.</p>
<p>The model shows that unlike previous thinking, carbon monoxide is forming on large particles of ice&#8212;especially after one million years. Prior to a million years, gaseous carbon monoxide is abundant and detectable in disks.</p>
<p>&#8220;This changes how we thought ice and gas was distributed in disks,&#8221; Powell says. &#8220;It also shows that detailed modeling like this is important to understand the fundamentals of these environments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell hopes her model can be further validated using observations with NASA&#8217;s Webb Telescope&#8212;which may be powerful enough to finally detect ice in disks, but that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Powell, who loves phase changes and the complicated processes behind them, says she is in awe of their influence. &#8220;Small-scale ice formation physics influences disk formation and evolution&#8212;now that&#8217;s really cool.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ae2b037c807270461e28309f36d3deb1"><name>conserve-electricity</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Statewide call for electricity conservation</title><summary>The California Independent System Operator has issued a statewide Flex Alert, which is a call for voluntary electricity conservation.</summary><start-date>1660719600000</start-date><display-name>Statewide call for electricity conservation</display-name><path>/2022/08/conserve-electricity</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/conserve-electricity</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1660779430761</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1660779430761</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The California Independent System Operator has issued a statewide Flex Alert, which is a call for voluntary electricity conservation, from 4-9 p.m. today, Aug. 17, due to high temperatures pushing up energy demand and tightening available power supplies.</p>
<p>Higher-than-normal temperatures, which California has experienced statewide today, drive up electricity demand, primarily from air conditioning use. Voluntary conservation helps balance supply and demand. Consumers are urged to conserve electricity, especially during the late afternoon and early evening, when the grid is most stressed due to higher demand and less solar energy.</p>

This grant will fund his research determining the molecular mechanisms that link the two fundamental processes of cell division and differentiation to control cell fate in stem cells. By studying these processes, he will gain new insights into how to differentiate stem cells for regenerative medicine&#8212;methods to regrow, heal, or replace damaged or diseased parts of the body.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stem cells are unique in that they are able to differentiate into other cell types. A stem cell can choose between two opposing fates: divide to self-renew or differentiate into a new specialized cell type. For the human body to function properly, stem cells need to accurately balance the rate of their division and differentiation, requiring communication at the molecular level to link these two processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the support of the $1.9 million, five-year MIRA grant, Shariati and his team of researchers will study and identify the molecular mechanisms that directly link stem cell division and differentiation so this knowledge can be leveraged for cell therapy purposes in clinical settings in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shariati&#8217;s research primarily focuses on stem cell fate in embryonic stem cells, which unlike other stem cell types, can grow into virtually any cell type in the body, also known as pluripotency, and hold unlimited self-renewal potential. These remarkable properties allow researchers to expand embryonic cells in a petri dish without the need to work directly with embryos.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our hope is by gaining a deeper understanding of the key players in embryonic stem cell division and differentiation, we will be able to more precisely control what type of cell we can make and be able to develop fully differentiated and functional cells for the purpose of regenerative medicine,&#8221; Shariati said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although many studies have focused on embryonic stem cell differentiation or division individually, much remains unknown about the foundational biology and molecular feedback mechanisms linking embryonic stem cell division and differentiation. Shariati&#8217;s goal is to address these mysteries and provide novel strategies for therapeutic applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is to make the most out of this opportunity by discovering new findings that will allow us to help patients in the future,&#8221; Shariati said. &#8220;It comes with lots of excitement and responsibility.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shariati will collaborate with researchers at UC Santa Cruz, Stanford University, and the University of Tubingen. He thanks his mentors and lab members for their support in accomplishing this award.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b7fc16a2807270467676d6ca1ec7c37d"><name>fairlie-bradford-osborne-award-2022</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Economics Professor Robert Fairlie takes home the Bradford-Osborne Research Award for the second year in a row</title><summary>The annual award recognizes the best peer-reviewed paper on diversity and entrepreneurship, and Fairlie was honored for his years-long research on the lack of access to capital for Black-owned startups compared to white-owned startups.</summary><start-date>1660892400000</start-date><path>/2022/08/fairlie-bradford-osborne-award-2022</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/fairlie-bradford-osborne-award-2022</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1660944127618</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1660944127618</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Elisa Smith</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/08/images/rob-fairlie-300px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/08/images/rob-fairlie-300px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rob-fairlie-300px.jpg</name><display-name>rob-fairlie-300px.jpg</display-name><file-size>168973</file-size><width>435</width><height>298</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Rob Fairlie</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/08/images/fairlie-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/08/images/fairlie-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fairlie-80px.jpg</name><display-name>fairlie-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>14014</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Rob Fairlie</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Economics Professor Robert Fairlie</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep, he did it again.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economics Professor </span><a href="https://economics.ucsc.edu/faculty/ladder-faculty.php?uid=rfairlie"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Fairlie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> received the Bradford-Osborne Research Award for the second year in a row. The </span><a href="https://foster.uw.edu/faculty-research/bradford-osborne-research-award/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;named after famed Black economists William Bradford, University of Washington professor emeritus of finance, and Alfred E. Osborne, Jr., senior associate dean for external affairs at UCLA&#8217;s Anderson School of Management&#8212;recognizes the year&#8217;s best paper, published in a peer-reviewed journal, on diversity and entrepreneurship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie received the award this year for his years-long </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28154"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the lack of access to capital for Black-owned startups compared to white-owned startups. Black families are economically disadvantaged at the start, as their median income is $37,000 compared to white families at $63,000. The ratio of median household net worth for Black families to that of white families is 11-to-1, and only 7% of Black families own stocks or mutual funds compared with 23% of white families (U.S. Census Bureau 2016).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Black entrepreneurs want to access start-up capital, the average level of capital Black entrepreneurs receive is $35,205 compared with $106,720 for white entrepreneurs. In the year the business is founded, Black owners contribute around $19,500 of personal equity compared with around $34,500 for white business owners.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black entrepreneurs also apply for bank loans less frequently than white entrepreneurs, mainly due to fear of rejection. They are about three times more likely to state that they did not apply for credit when needed for fear of their loan application being denied.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Racial inequality in business ownership is a huge issue, and there is a lot of work that needs to be done to change the perceptions and actual access to capital among traditionally underserved borrowers,&#8221; said Fairlie.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie first received the Bradford-Osborne Research Award in 2021 for his work exploring </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/11/fairlie-national-research-award.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the impacts of COVID-19 on small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the United States. Fairlie wrote one of the </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jems.12400"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first papers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on racial inequality in pandemic-related closures, which found that in the first three months of the pandemic, February-April 2020, minority-owned businesses were affected by closures at substantially higher rates than their white counterparts. Black business ownership dropped 41%, Latinx business ownership fell by 32%, and Asian business ownership dropped by 26%, compared to white-owned businesses, which fell by 17% during this period.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigrant business owners also experienced substantial declines (36%), and female-business owners were disproportionately affected (25%).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie&#8217;s pandemic-related research sparked international media attention and led to </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/fairlie-ppp-testimony.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">congressional testimony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the U.S. House of Representatives and was used by then-Senator Kamala Harris for a bill supporting minority-owned businesses. Additional work showed that changes to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) had helped to improve racial equity in loan distribution. He is continuing to track his pandemic-related research and hopes to have an update later this year for the National Academy of Sciences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m excited and deeply honored to be recognized again for this award,&#8221; said Fairlie. &#8220;Dr. Bradford and Dr. Osborne were ahead of their time and have done so much for this field, specifically on topics related to diversity in business ownership.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c6ad1ad5807270467676d6ca0b4c4d7b"><name>crj-inaugural-summer-institute-feature-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Building communities to stand up against anti-black racism</title><summary>This month, the Center for Racial Justice (CRJ) at UC Santa Cruz held its first-ever Summer Institute, “Political Education and Liberatory Knowledge,” complete with immersive, hands-on workshops that emphasized solidarity against systemic oppression and community-based strategies to fight anti-black racism and imperialism.</summary><start-date>1661194800000</start-date><display-name>crjsummerinstitutefeaturedw</display-name><path>/2022/08/crj-inaugural-summer-institute-feature-dw</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/crj-inaugural-summer-institute-feature-dw</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1661190609598</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1661284513969</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/omowale.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/omowale.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>omowale.jpg</name><display-name>omowale.jpg</display-name><file-size>116284</file-size><width>1422</width><height>792</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/crj-thumbnail80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/crj-thumbnail80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>crj-thumbnail80.jpg</name><display-name>crj-thumbnail80.jpg</display-name><file-size>20644</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yusef Omowale, a staff member of the Southern California Library, an archive that documents histories of community resistance to racism located in South Central L.A., guided the first day&#8217;s discussion. </span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/crj-logo400jpg.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/crj-logo400jpg.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>crj-logo400jpg.jpg</name><display-name>crj-logo400jpg.jpg</display-name><file-size>54893</file-size><width>400</width><height>346</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption><span>Established in 2019 through seed funding from the university, the Center for Racial Justice (CRJ) aims to bring students, faculty, local communities, and invited guests together in much-needed campus-wide dialogue on race and racial justice. </span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>The inaugural session of the Center for Racial Justice Summer Institute brought activists, community leaders, students, staff and faculty together in solidarity for racial justice

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each day of the inaugural CRJ Summer Institute featured teaching and collective study sessions, shared dialog, and workshops framed by different political educational approaches to racial justice, both past and present. The Summer Institute ran from August 10-12. These virtual events were free and open to the public. The attendance for the three days totaled 222 people.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC associate professor of literature Christine Hong, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chair of Critical Race and Ethnic Studies and director of the Center for Racial Justice, spoke about the potential for the workshop series to have far-ranging impact. Because they ch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">allenge the status quo, movements for racial justice have necessarily involved political education, Hong said. She pointed out that political education, for this reason, has taken place outside formal educational institutions during the history of racial justice movements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Summer Institute presentations are not pitched narrowly to academics but have been organized to bring together community organizers, activists, teachers, students, and ethnic studies practitioners,&#8221; Hong said. Referring to the first day&#8217;s session, she said, &#8220;We hope that what will emerge here is a series of critical and clarifying discussions on solidarity against anti-blackness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first day of the event, organized around the theme of &#8220;Practicing Solidarity Against Anti-Blackness in an Age of Reproduced Illusions,&#8221; drew 93 enthusiastic participants including local community activists as well as UCSC faculty, students, and staff. Those who attended came away with new inspiration as well as strategies for combating racism by considering its systemic causes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yusef Omowale, a staff member of the Southern California Library, an archive that documents histories of community resistance to racism located in South Central L.A., guided the first day&#8217;s discussion. Omowale broke the audience into working groups. Although each group was assigned a set of materials to review and discuss, the overarching emphasis was on structural context, history, and critical understanding as the basis of anti-racist solidarity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omowale&#8217;s connection to the Southern California Library provided rich historical context for his discussion, with its documentation of movements in L.A. and beyond that have challenged racism over the past 50 years.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Every aspect of the group discussions was steeped in the history and culture of struggles against racism, starting with the screening of live footage of singer Nina Simone in 1968 performing &#8220;Don&#8217;t Let Me Be Misunderstood,&#8221; a song that was written for Simone and later turned into a hit by the British Invasion rock group The Animals.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone used her songs to fight racism and contribute her voice to the Civil Rights movement. Omowale opened with Simone&#8217;s performance of this song to illustrate how groups that experience racism often face misrepresentation, becoming the focus of media narratives that worsen their struggles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, he showed a documentary clip about the police shooting that killed Fred Hampton and Mark Clark of the Black Panther Party&#8217;s Chicago chapter in 1969. After Hampton&#8217;s and Clark&#8217;s assassinations, the police made false claims &#8211; amplified by sympathetic media &#8211; that they shot Hampton and Clark only after they were subject to a barrage of shooting from Black Panther Party members. But later ballistics reports showed that police fired all but one of the gunshots.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The community backlash against the official police account speaks to the ways in which Black people have contested dominant racist misrepresentations, Omowale said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Black Panther Party was initially held responsible for the shootout and even for the deaths of its own members, they had control over the apartment where the shootings took place, and gave community tours. In this way, they were able to show the public the circumstances of the killings, presenting evidence that contradicted the official story, correcting history in the process, Omowale said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the first day&#8217;s session centered on the aftermath and media coverage of violence that broke out in 2018 at the now-closed Happy Red Apple Nails salon in the Bronx. A viral surveillance video showed Asian workers attacking a group of Black women customers, one of whom had complained about the quality of a five-dollar eyebrow wax job. The fight increased neighborhood tensions and led to widespread protests.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants in the various working groups expressed strong sympathy for the Black customers who were beaten and forcibly prevented from leaving the business. Attendee comments initially focused on the spectacle of interethnic violence&#8212; &#8220;unlawful detention,&#8221; &#8220;heightened escalation,&#8221; &#8220;money and capitalism over people,&#8221; and &#8220;internalization of anti-Black racism&#8221;&#8212;and moved toward structural analysis, with mention of racial triangulation and shared sources of oppression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working group members also called attention to a Black man at the salon who was trying to position himself between both groups and ease the tensions. The video has no sound, but it is clear from his body language, and the way that others were reacting to him, that he was attempting to mediate and encourage non-violent responses to an escalating situation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, media coverage of such events can be inflammatory, causing the public to be quick to judge without considering historical context, such as the fact that both the workers and the Black residents of the neighborhood have immigrant roots and are vulnerable, Omowale said. He mentioned that many of those who patronized the clinic are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from the Caribbean.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The violence against the patrons was shocking, and the patrons deserved to be treated with respect and dignity, Omowale said. But he also added complexity to this picture by asking, &#8220;What does it mean when you go to work and are willing to fight over $5? What might your conditions be? There are all kinds of reasons in which we are placed in these conditions, including dispossession and racial capitalism.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After showing news footage of some Black community leaders calling not just for the nail salon to be shut down but also for the nail salon workers to be deported, Omowale asked attendees to consider what being &#8220;in community&#8221; and in solidarity with Black people means and whether some forms of historical harm are co-constituted. In response, some Summer Institute participants noted that many nail salon workers put in long hours for extremely low pay, and referred to an oft-cited </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report showing rampant exploitation of the salon workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shauntay Larkins, UCSC director of Student Achievement, was alarmed by the brutality but pointed to the less visible violence inherent in the confrontation. &#8220;It spoke to the issue of how $5 is no longer just $5,&#8221; she said, referring to the disputed bill. &#8220;So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">much more is at stake for both of these communities being subjected to similar kinds of economic violence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It would take a very special mediator to bring the two groups together because the resentments are entrenched,&#8221; Larkins said. &#8220;There should be some kind of restorative reconciliation because there are really two communities that are suffering.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Gardner, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">di</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rector of academic and cocurricular programs at UCSC, also emphasized &#8220;creating restorative space to address the harm that was caused&#8221; to the patrons.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betsy Yoon, a member of the New York City-based, grassroots community organization Nodutdol, also underscored the need to &#8220;reorient community response away from neoliberal, power-aligned responses to injustice&#8221; in order to enact meaningful solidarity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second day of the Summer Institute was organized around the writings and legacies of theorist Harry Chang, who led study groups, including the Racism Research Project, throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Chang&#8217;s ideas influenced critical race theory, critical race studies, and anti-imperialist community-based organizing yet he has seldom been recognized for his influence in those arenas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organized around Chang&#8217;s writings, the morning workshop was facilitated by Paul Liem, the chairperson of the Korea Policy Institute, and JT Takagi, the executive director of Third World Newsreel. Focused on the theory and organizing imprinted by Chang&#8217;s conceptualization of race and racism, the afternoon session featured Neil Gotanda, professor emeritus of Western State College of Law and co-founder of the Critical Race Theory Workshop in the late 1980s, Linda Burnham, former national research director at the National Domestic Workers Alliance and co-founder of the Women of Color Resource Center, and Bob Wing, founding editor of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ColorLines </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">War Times/Tiempo de Guerras</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first session of the final day of the CRJ Summer Institute represented the launch of the public syllabus project of the Ending the Korean War Teaching Collective, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which fosters critical approaches to understanding the war that complicate the ways in which this topic is often taught in schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Featuring Juyeon Rhee, for over a decade the main organizer of the Korea Education and Exposure Programs (KEEP), which educates and sends Koreans from the diaspora to North and South Korea to take part in peace and social justice work, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8203;&#8203;he closing session focused on the long legacy of anti-imperialist </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hakseup </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(&#8220;hak&#8221; or study, plus &#8220;seup&#8221; or practice) stretching back to the Japanese colonial era and informed by the long movement of the Korean people against U.S.-backed military dictators in South Korea.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan is to hold a Summer Institute every other year, Christine Hong said. The next Summer Institute will take place in the summer of 2024.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c6ade8ac807270467676d6cac9b9f17b"><name>waters-extreme-journey</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>‘Water’s Extreme Journey,’ a new exhibit at the Seymour Center, opens in September </title><summary>A new exhibit opening in September at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center features a maze and interactive activities highlighting the challenges of keeping our water clean.</summary><start-date>1661151600000</start-date><display-name>‘Water’s Extreme Journey,’ a new exhibit at the Seymour Center, opens in September </display-name><path>/2022/08/waters-extreme-journey</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/waters-extreme-journey</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1661190662295</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1661190982873</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/maze-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/maze-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>maze-500.jpg</name><display-name>maze-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>137695</file-size><width>500</width><height>295</height></image><image-alt>photo of maze exhibit from above</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/maze-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/maze-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>maze-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>maze-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19364</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>exhibit logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/maze-kids-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/maze-kids-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>maze-kids-350.jpg</name><display-name>maze-kids-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>108270</file-size><width>350</width><height>287</height></image><image-alt>children interacting with exhibit</image-alt><image-caption><em>Water&#8217;s Extreme Journey</em> is a family friendly exhibit opening September 3 at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>Water&#8217;s Extreme Journey,</em> a new exhibit opening in September at the <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a>, features a maze and interactive activities highlighting the challenges of keeping our water clean. Visitors experience the watershed as a water drop, exploring firsthand the science behind the water cycle.</p>
<p>The exhibit will be open to the public from September 3 through December 31, 2022. Seymour Center members are invited for a first look at the new exhibit on Friday, September 2. More information is available online at <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/visit/exhibits/">seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/visit/exhibits</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Water&#8217;s Extreme Journey</em> maze transforms visitors into a raindrop and sends them on a journey through mountains, streams, and even their own backyards, where every day decisions impact their chance of staying clean and reaching a healthy ocean.</p>
<p>While investigating winding pathways, visitors are challenged to navigate through pollutants originating from agriculture, development, litter, and our homes. Will the farm they pass by be organic? Did someone pour leftover paint down the drain? This fully interactive maze experience engages visitors through play, scientific inquiry, art and action, illuminating human impacts great and small while teaching how to contribute to healthy, safe water in their community and beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a super fun maze, very family friendly, where you&#8217;re a drop of water and your goal is to get to the ocean clean,&#8221; said Seymour Center Executive Director Jonathan Hicken.</p>
<p>Created by the marine life artist Wyland and Seattle-based Minotaur Mazes, <em>Water&#8217;s Extreme Journey</em> blends art, science, and action. The Seymour Center has added supplementary panels to the exhibit to highlight water issues particularly relevant to the Central Coast. Hicken said the additions were developed in consultation with UCSC faculty and representatives from Central Coast communities and nonprofits.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was really interesting to get all these people together, including water experts and community leaders, and talk about what are the most important things to teach people about water on the Central Coast,&#8221; Hicken said. &#8220;The panels we added are focused on issues of water supply, water quality, and drought and the impacts of climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Seymour Marine Discovery Center is a community-supported marine science education center operated by UC Santa Cruz and dedicated to educating people about the role scientific research plays in the understanding and conservation of the world&#8217;s oceans.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>10-31-2022</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c7bbc032807270467676d6ca57ace642"><name>ombuds-application</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Application period opens for campus Ombuds </title><summary>The application period for a campus Ombuds is now open.

Like many other novel scientific concepts, this one came as a convergence of facts, an accumulation of already scientifically established truths that, when combined, led to the creation of a technology transformational to how we understand our own human DNA.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the time, Deamer was a professor at UC Davis. His research was focused on creating an artificial cell by trapping nucleic acid, the material that makes DNA and RNA, inside of a vesicle made of a double layer of lipids, similar to the membrane which encapsulates living cells.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He had pioneered methods to create small channels in the layers of a membrane to allow an ionic current to flow through. He also knew of a technology called a Coulter counter, a method for counting the red blood cells by running a current through a hole in a membrane just big enough to accommodate a red blood cell, and seeing when that current was disturbed, indicating that a red cell had passed through.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As he drove along with this knowledge humming in the back of his mind, he pondered the central problem he faced in making artificial cells: how he could get the molecules that make up nucleic acid through a membrane layer, which was nearly impermeable to material of that size. In thinking about this challenge, he realized that a tiny, naturally-occurring pore in the membrane might let the molecules pass through. This led him to think that if he ran an ionic current through the pore, he would essentially have a molecular Coulter counter, as the molecules passing through the pore would create an observable effect on the current.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, it really hit him: the four bases of DNA and RNA &#8211; A, C, G, and T or U &#8211; are slightly different sizes. So, if he pulled a string of DNA floating in solution through that hole, each one would have a base-specific effect on the current, which could be translated to read the bases. Deamer pulled to the side of the road at that moment, scrawling in red ink the original concept for nanopore sequencing, a novel and revolutionary method of reading DNA and RNA. The name references the size of the pore, which would end up being just two nanometers across &#8211; a sheet of paper is about 100,000 nanometers thick.</span></p>

</figure>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It took years of research, persistence, and support to combat skepticism from the scientific community and bring the technology to where it is today. The ideas, licensed to Oxford Nanopore Technologies as patents, led to the development of the revolutionary MinION, a small, portable device that uses a nanopore to read DNA and RNA at a fraction of the cost of the state-of-the-art competitors, making sequencing accessible for scientists around the world. To date, these licenses have become the most lucrative invention out of UCSC.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nanopore technology has enabled some of the most significant advances in the genomics field, such as the completion of a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/t2t-genome.html"><span class="s2">gapless human genome</span></a>. Many of the sequenced COVID-19 genomes globally used nanopore sequencing, making it crucial in the fight to stop the pandemic. And now, scientists continue to create innovative ways to use the technology, from gaining a deeper understanding of the origins of life on Earth to searching for life in outer space.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Initial experiments and years of work</strong>&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It wasn&#8217;t until a few years after the original idea struck that nanopore sequencing research really got underway. In 1994, Deamer moved to join his wife and professor of biochemistry &#211;l&#246;f Einarsd&#243;ttir at UC Santa Cruz, where he became a research professor. Around the same time, he decided to pursue a patent for his idea in collaboration with his longtime friend and Harvard professor Dan Branton, who had been Deamer&#8217;s post-doctoral advisor when the two were both at UC Berkeley in the 1960s.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After submitting their patent through the Harvard patent office, they were told that another researcher, prominent Harvard geneticist George Church, just happened to be working on a similar idea to pump DNA through a nanoscopic pore &#8211; although with little success at the time.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Deamer and Branton&#8217;s initial experiments in the labs of UCSC and Harvard were proving fruitful. By the time they submitted their patents, they had collaborated with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) scientist John Kasianowicz to successfully move nucleic acids through a pore in a membrane. Deamer and Branton decided to team up with Church as named inventors on the patents, and shortly after won a grant from the National Science Foundation supporting two years of research.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By that time, the group had gathered momentum: they wrote <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.93.24.13770"><span class="s2">a seminal, decisive paper</span></a> on the technology in 1996 that has since been cited thousands of times, officially got patent rights on their idea in 1998, and won another NIH grant. Their paper convinced another talented scientist to join the team: Mark Akeson, Deamer&#8217;s former postdoc student, moved his family out to Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<figure class="image align-right"><img alt="Portrait of Mark Akeson." src="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/08/images/akeson_350.png"/>

</figure>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">&#8220;I, at first, didn't believe it was going to work,&#8221; Akeson said. &#8220;And then lo and behold, Dave and his colleagues at NIST went on to prove that translocation through a nanopore actually happens. That was the most pivotal early experiment that led the way to me coming to Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Akeson took an unusual career path to end up as one of the foremost scientists developing nanopore technology. During his undergraduate years at UC San Diego, he majored in history with a minor in molecular biology, and then spent many years in Central America working on agricultural development projects while also a graduate student at UC Davis studying soil microbiology. It was during his time at Davis that he met Deamer, and the two quickly hit it off, forming the connection that led Deamer to invite Akeson to join the nanopore work after spending several years as a research scientist at the NIH.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Akeson joined the nanopore group to study the molecular biology processes that would enable the technology, and was tasked to set up the original nanopore device in their Baskin School of Engineering lab.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deamer and Akeson gained their first graduate student when Wenonah Vercoutere, the first in her family to pursue graduate school with a dream of working for NASA, joined the research group. Although she originally joined to pursue Deamer&#8217;s other research projects, she was quickly brought in to help Akeson with his experiments.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0301_248"><span class="s2">paper published in 2001</span></a> with Vercoutere as the first author, the group was able to prove that the individual bases could indeed be distinguished from each other as they impeded the ionic current through the nanometer pore in alpha-hemolysin, a toxic protein secreted by bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;That paper finally convinced a bunch of skeptical people that we knew what we were doing, because it clearly showed that we can see a piece of DNA get into the pore as a double stranded hairpin, unwind in the pore and proceed on through,&#8221; Deamer said. &#8220;That was just spectacular &#8211; we were watching individual molecules do this little trick in the pore. Finally we broke through some of the skepticism, because nobody could believe, at the time, that this might work.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the help of UCSC Genomics Institute Director David Haussler and his graduate student Stephen Winters-Hilt, the team developed computer learning methods to automate the translation of the ionic current impediments into the base composition of DNA. This effort was a precursor for the leadership role of UCSC and later the Genomics Institute in bioinformatics.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It was really pretty amazing to be at that place, doing that work, and having those kinds of findings,&#8221; said Vercoutere, who is now a research scientist at NASA Ames Research Center.&#160;</span></p>
<figure class="image align-right"><img alt="Photograph of nanopore researchers sitting at a computer from the early 2000s." src="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/08/images/group_350.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;"/>

</figure>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There were two main challenges the scientists now faced: they needed a pore with sufficient constriction to allow just a few bases at a time to be detected and identified, and a way to slow the DNA down as it moved through the pore. Originally, translocation of DNA through the pore was happening at a rate of two microseconds (two millionths of a second) per base, and it needed to be on the millisecond (one thousandth of a second) time scale, a thousand times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Akeson pioneered the solution to the second challenge when he discovered the first enzyme, a polymerase, that could latch on to the DNA strand and slow down its movement. A few years later, an NIH-funded project to <a href="https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/1000-Dollar-Genome-Program"><span class="s2">sequence a human genome for just $1,000</span></a> attracted many scientists to the field, including another crucial contributor to the development of nanopore sequencing. Jens Gundlach from the University of Washington joined the team around that time, and solved the first problem when he discovered a better pore to string DNA through, and quickly filed a patent for that idea with his university.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It was a struggle at times,&#8221; Akeson said. &#8220;There were a lot of people, like I was initially, who were very skeptical. It took a lot of setbacks and experiments by very talented Santa Cruz scientists to make it work.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deamer recounts that a colleague at the NIH told him that at one point, to pass through a multi-step review process to gain research funding, two nobel laureates were brought in to determine if any physical laws would prevent the technology from being possible.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Bless their hearts, they said &#8216;No, there's no physical law, everything is kosher in terms of the physics, it might work!&#8217;&#8221; Deamer said. &#8220;Suddenly, we had a few million dollars in the bank to spend.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Oxford Nanopore Technologies&#160;</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2007, two men in posh, bespoke English suits, Gordon Sanghera and Spike Willcocks, strolled through the forested UCSC campus, on their way to pay a visit to Akeson and Deamer. They wanted to license several of the patents related to nanopore sequencing with the hope of commercializing the technology through their new company, <a href="https://nanoporetech.com/"><span class="s2">Oxford Nanopore Technologies</span></a> (ONT).&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I've learned a lesson: if you can patent something, you better do it,&#8221; Deamer said with a chuckle.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although technically just a formality because the university held the patents, Deamer and Akeson gave permission for ONT to use their ideas, and the two researchers joined the company on its scientific advisory board. They had previously pitched their idea to other companies without success, and now, industry was coming to them.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With renowned Oxford biochemist Hagan Bayley as a founder, ONT set off to overcome a series of challenges to bring a product to market. Meanwhile, Deamer and Akeson continued their research in collaboration with Gundlach. Then, in 2012, ONT revealed the product of their years of work at the American Genomics Biotechnology Meeting in Naples, Florida.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">&#8220;It's kind of the rock-and-roll DNA technology meeting of the year,&#8221; Akeson said. &#8220;People love to go there because it's very festive, people have a great time, and they talk about DNA.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Amidst the celebratory atmosphere, ONT&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer Clive Brown gave the scientists another thing to be excited about. In a historic moment, he held up a Nokia cell phone-sized, handheld device to sequence DNA &#8211; competing technology was the size of a large refrigerator &#8211; which could be plugged into a laptop and cost just $1,000. He called it the MinION.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The competing devices were $100,000 and up,&#8221; Deamer said. &#8220;This is what is meant by disruptive technology, and this is why major companies, recognizing the threat, will try to put the little company out of business. We stunned the biotech world.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Two years later, the MinION devices were available for sale, but not before working through some major engineering challenges. Instead of stringing DNA through one tiny pore, as Deamer&#8217;s original idea dictated, the device they developed draws DNA through 2,000 nanopores, at a rate of about 450 bases per second.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The MinION&#8217;s software would keep track of electrical signals as each individual strand went through its pore, and used an algorithm developed by ONT to perform base calling, the automated translation of those bases&#8217; signals into readable DNA sequences. They also had to invent a membrane that could be transported through the mail, and developed their own pore to string the DNA through after a legal battle with competitor Illumina meant they could no longer use their original pore.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ONT offered the MinION for $1,000 each to a scientific users group, which attracted many scientists fascinated by the new device, and allowed ONT to learn from the hundreds of laboratories using their technology. Since the original release in 2014, continual improvements have increased the MinION&#8217;s accuracy from about 64% to close to 99%.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since then, ONT has released several other models of their device: the GridION, which has the power of five MinIONs working together, and the PromethION, with the power of 40 MinIONs. This year, scientists set the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2022/01/dna-sequencing-technique.html"><span class="s2">world record for the fastest DNA sequencing</span></a> using the PromethION, reading through the human genome in just five hours.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That was not the only incredible scientific feat that nanopore sequencing enabled this year. When UCSC Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Karen Miga and the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/telomere-to-telomere"><span class="s2">Telomere-to-Telomere</span></a> (T2T) consortium of international scientists completed the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/t2t-genome.html"><span class="s2">first-ever gapless sequence of a human genome</span></a>, it was nanopore sequencing technology that allowed the team to do long reads, decoding the millions of repeated bases in the the human genome, which is impossible with other sequencing techniques.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And nanopore technology is revolutionary in that it allows sequencing to happen anywhere in the world: in the frosty Arctic tundra and in remote areas of the developing world, empowering local health officials to sequence without requiring the shipment and handling requirements of sending samples by express mail.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The future of nanopore sequencing</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looking forward, Akeson hopes to see nanopore technology become more accurate at sequencing RNA and more efficient, hopefully requiring fewer molecules to do sequencing. To him, the potential of sequencing is limitless.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The notion that sentient beings would never stop improving DNA sequencing technology is absurd,&#8221; Akeson said. &#8220;It's always going to get better because it's a miraculous way of storing information.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Researchers such as Northeastern Assistant Professor of Bioengineering and Physics Miten Jain, who received his Ph.D. in bioinformatics at UCSC with the nanopore group, hope to continue to leverage nanopore sequencing in a clinical diagnostic setting. For critically ill individuals, quick sequencing can be crucial for determining if the cause of life-threatening conditions are genetic.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another goal is to make it possible for any person, not just genomic experts, to do DNA sequencing with nanopore technology. The researchers imagine a future where a household has a small automated sequencer they can use to figure out what was the cause of a cold, or what within your food gave you a stomachache.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deamer&#8217;s ongoing research uses nanopore sequencing to study how life began on Earth four billion years ago. He has been traveling to volcanoes at locations all around the world &#8211; California, Hawaii, Yellowstone, Iceland, Russia, New Zealand &#8211; to study how wet/dry cycles around the hot springs might have created the conditions in which nucleic acids originally came to exist.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the use of nanopore sequencing is not limited to just studying life on Earth. Already, a MinION has been brought to the International Space Station to sequence organisms such as bacteria and viruses that may threaten astronaut&#8217;s health.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vercoutere and Deamer, having stayed close friends and colleagues over the years, are working on a project to send an instrument based on nanopore technology to Mars on a future NASA mission. The device would drill down into the ice on Mars's surface, melt that ice, and look for nucleic acids as evidence of life on the red planet.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, back in Santa Cruz, researchers across campus continue to use the technology to push the frontiers of genomics, molecular biology, and more.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Santa Cruz is really one of the centers internationally for implementing nanopore sequencing on the Oxford devices,&#8221; Akeson said. &#8220;The invention and pioneering academic work was at our campus, our Genomics Institute and the RNA Center really knows how to use the technology &#8211; Santa Cruz is world class in both of those fields. The spark started at our campus.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cbe08020807270467676d6ca119a3764"><name>sinsheimer-mural</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New mural in Sinsheimer Laboratories building celebrates diversity in science</title><summary>The mural by artist Paul Lewin was commissioned as part of the healing process after disturbing incidents of vandalism targeting Black Lives Matter posters.</summary><start-date>1661238000000</start-date><display-name>New mural in Sinsheimer Laboratories building celebrates diversity in science</display-name><path>/2022/08/sinsheimer-mural</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/sinsheimer-mural</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1661277863950</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1661278272222</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/sinsheimer-mural-550.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/sinsheimer-mural-550.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sinsheimer-mural-550.jpg</name><display-name>sinsheimer-mural-550.jpg</display-name><file-size>142770</file-size><width>550</width><height>409</height></image><image-alt>Paul Lewin standing next to mural</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/paul-lewin-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/paul-lewin-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>paul-lewin-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>paul-lewin-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25863</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Paul Lewin painting</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/paul-lewin-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/paul-lewin-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>paul-lewin-350.jpg</name><display-name>paul-lewin-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>71560</file-size><width>350</width><height>330</height></image><image-alt>Paul Lewin painting</image-alt><image-caption>Artist Paul Lewin painted the new mural in the Sinsheimer Laboratories building. (Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>The mural by artist Paul Lewin was commissioned as part of the healing process after disturbing incidents of vandalism targeting Black Lives Matter posters </article-subhead><article-text><p>A series of vandalism incidents in the Sinsheimer Laboratories building, starting in 2020 and continuing into 2021, left Black students on Science and Engineering Hill feeling unsafe and unwelcome. As one step in the healing process, a new mural by the artist Paul Lewin now brightens the first-floor entrance to the Sinsheimer Labs.</p>
<p>Juliana Nzongo, a graduate student in microbiology and environmental toxicology who served as the student representative on the mural committee, said the reactions to the mural have been very positive. &#8220;Some people go there every week or every morning just to look at it, and a lot of people have said it brings them a sense of peace coming into the building,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The students met with Lewin twice before deciding he was the right artist to do the mural. &#8220;It felt right to go with Paul Lewin&#8212;I felt he would represent Blackness in a way that could help Black students in the sciences feel a sense of belonging, like this is their community too, because there are not a lot of us on Science Hill,&#8221; Nzongo said.</p>
<p>Lewin&#8217;s art, which has been featured on the covers of novels by science fiction author Octavia Butler, is inspired by Afro-Caribbean and African folklore, nature, science fiction, and Afrofuturism. The mural features a variety of images related to science and nature, including motifs that appear in many of Lewin&#8217;s paintings.</p>
<p>&#8220;My art and life have always been inspired by science,&#8221; Lewin said. &#8220;In the mural, there is a central figure, an ancient ancestral spirit, performing a ritual that celebrates the interconnectedness of all life on earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Born in Jamaica, Lewin was based in Oakland for many years and currently lives in Miami. He was one of several potential artists suggested to the committee by John Jota Lea&#241;os, professor of film and digital media, who had met Lewin in San Francisco.</p>
<p>&#8220;When John first reached out to me back in March of this year about the mural, I was really moved by the backstory,&#8221; Lewin said. &#8220;Hearing the students tell their stories directly was very impactful to me. I wanted to create an image with a strong representation of Blackness in the sciences that encompassed many generations, from ancient Africa and other indigenous communities to the present and future Black students of UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ocean Sciences Professor Christina Ravelo, who serves as associate dean for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, said the mural is just one step in the division&#8217;s efforts to create a more supportive environment for students of color.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mural needs to be seen as part of a process of transformation that we are working on, and not as an indication that we are where we want to be,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The vandalism and other incidents, in the midst of all that was going on nationally, was very stressful. It was a bad time.&#8221;</p>
<p>It began in June 2020, when campus buildings were closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Students and researchers conducting pressing research and running essential experiments were allowed to use their laboratories in Sinsheimer, but access to the building was restricted. When Black Lives Matter posters in the Sinsheimer elevator were defaced and torn down, students felt threatened, especially since they were often in their labs when few other people were around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody who had access was saying, &#8216;You don&#8217;t belong here,&#8217; and it made a lot of students feel unsafe,&#8221; Nzongo said. &#8220;One of my good friends had to come late at night to do some time points for her experiments, and we had to keep in touch via text to make sure she got home safely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campus has since installed additional security cameras, including in the elevator. Ravelo also said a growing number of departments in the sciences have held or scheduled anti-racist training programs for faculty and staff.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Nzongo said students felt angry and frustrated by what they felt was a slow response to the incidents by campus police and the administration. &#8220;The students had a list of things they wanted in order to feel safer on Science Hill,&#8221; Nzongo said. &#8220;The mural was one thing we were able to get money and support for right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mural committee sought an artist who would create a mural that &#8220;captures UCSC&#8217;s vision of science excellence, innovation and creativity, which can only be achieved in an environment that is mindful of different identities and lived experiences, and that approaches collaboration with cultural humility and mutual respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nzongo said she recently brought a group of high school students who were on campus for the <a href="https://cosmos.ucsc.edu/">COSMOS</a> Program to see the mural.</p>
<p>&#8220;They loved it, and they all wanted to take photos in front of it,&#8221; she said, &#8220;so it hasn&#8217;t just touched those of us on Science Hill, but others who, when they see the mural, stop and think about what it means for them.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cbf10999807270467676d6ca7deb04c7"><name>news-article</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>A lifetime of connection starts today</title><summary>Incoming students and alumni share in the thrill of being Banana Slugs with new summer send-off series&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 3,400 new students and family members registered for the events, hosted by generous alumni and parents at a mix of private homes and public venues. UCSC alumni and staff, including representatives from housing and student life, student affairs, and admissions, shared invaluable information about the university. The in-person events were so well received that a virtual option was offered in order to meet additional demand.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Slug Send-Offs are a wonderful opportunity for our incoming students to make new friends and learn more about UC Santa Cruz in a small, intimate setting,&#8221; says Lauren Taylor, assistant director for early engagement. &#8220;It really helps them feel more confident and comfortable when they arrive here in the fall.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For our new students, we&#8217;re helping to build a lifetime of connection to UC Santa Cruz by starting with this nexus of friendship and support,&#8221; says John D. Pine, assistant vice chancellor for alumni engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alumni and family support is really critical to the program&#8217;s success,&#8221; Pine says. &#8220;They can host an event at their home or business or simply attend a Slug Send-Off event in their community. Parents have a chance to meet one another, and it gives alumni the opportunity to support our newest Banana Slugs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans are already underway for next summer&#8217;s send-off series, including events at more locations in California and across the country.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Launched in 2021, CITRIS Aviation was created to support interdisciplinary development of cutting-edge technologies and applications to help improve environmental monitoring, urban air mobility, wildfire response, security policy, and more. The initiative integrates faculty and staff expertise, research efforts, and educational programs and leverages aviation assets across the four CITRIS campuses at Berkeley, Davis, Merced and Santa Cruz.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Aviation activities are rapidly growing within the Santa Cruz region, with several large projects and centers emerging in recent years,&#8221; Sanfelice said. &#8220;Local industry is not only developing, but also requiring, new technology ranging from farming to aerial transportation solutions. UC Santa Cruz is a strategically located hub to host the CITRIS Aviation initiative.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The future of aviation is at an inflection point,&#8221; Sanfelice continued. &#8220;Without CITRIS&#8217;s interdisciplinarity, it would be impossible to solve many of the problems that aviation currently faces.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Within the broader area of control and systems theory, Sanfelice investigates hybrid dynamical systems, or highly complex systems that experience both continuous and instantaneous changes. While much of the work is theoretical, he grounds his findings in real-world usage &#8212; particularly in autonomous aerial vehicles and other intelligent transportation technologies. He also directs the Cyber-Physical Systems Research Center (CPSRC) at UC Santa Cruz, which supports <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/sanfelice-cps-award.html"><span class="s2">research</span></a> related to power grids, agriculture, manufacturing, and connected health.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sanfelice&#8217;s relationship with CITRIS began with a 2016 Seed Award to support early-stage work on secure algorithms for cloud robotics. His connection has strengthened with seed funding in 2017 for a California-Mexico partnership to explore autonomous robotic grasping, in 2018 for a cross-campus collaboration with UC Berkeley on safe planning and control for aerial vehicles, and in 2021 for drone-assisted wildfire risk assessment in a project called <a href="https://citris-uc.org/forming-links-to-solve-big-problems-katia-obraczka-embraces-citriss-interdisciplinary-mission/">EUREKA</a>, led by fellow UC Santa Cruz professor Katia Obraczka.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I am thrilled that CITRIS has tapped Sanfelice to lead student and faculty researchers at a time of enormous creativity and innovation within the aviation industry,&#8221; said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;His experience in developing leading-edge technology and bridging academia and industry will allow him to provide clear vision and leadership for this important new initiative."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the past six years, Sanfelice has also served on the <a href="https://citris-uc.org/research/people-and-robots/">CITRIS People and Robots</a> executive committee, which convenes faculty from all four campuses to identify challenges and research opportunities for the initiative to address. He plans to form a similar multicampus steering committee for CITRIS Aviation to bring together partners and contributors with related interests.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to welcome professor Sanfelice to the CITRIS leadership team and look forward to building a robust framework for innovation in aviation technology across the four campuses and beyond,&#8221; said Costas Spanos, director of CITRIS and the Banatao Institute.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sanfelice&#8217;s appointment is effective July 1.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d188ef4e807270465b92b7e80d92481f"><name>exoplanet-carbon-dioxide</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>JWST makes first unequivocal detection of carbon dioxide in an exoplanet atmosphere</title><summary>UCSC astronomer Natalie Batalha leads a team that detected carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the exoplanet WASP-39b using the James Webb Space Telescope.</summary><keywords>Natalie Batalha, Jonathan Fortney</keywords><start-date>1661436000000</start-date><display-name>JWST makes first unequivocal detection of carbon dioxide in an exoplanet atmosphere</display-name><path>/2022/08/exoplanet-carbon-dioxide</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/exoplanet-carbon-dioxide</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1661372788537</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1661524885568</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/wasp39b-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/wasp39b-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wasp39b-500.jpg</name><display-name>wasp39b-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>37307</file-size><width>500</width><height>361</height></image><image-alt>exoplanet WASP-39b</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/natalie-batalha-ez-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/natalie-batalha-ez-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>natalie-batalha-ez-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>natalie-batalha-ez-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27732</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Astronomer Natalie Batalha</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>This illustration shows what the exoplanet WASP-39b could look like, based on current understanding of the planet.

(Photo by Elena Zhukova)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>The James Webb Space Telescope is helping astronomers characterize the atmospheres of planets very different from those in our solar system</article-subhead><article-text><p>For the first time, astronomers have found unambiguous evidence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of an exoplanet (a planet outside our solar system).</p>
<p>The discovery, accepted for publication in <em>Nature</em> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11692">posted online August 24</a>, demonstrates the power of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to deliver unprecedented observations of exoplanet atmospheres.</p>
<p>Natalie Batalha, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, leads the team of astronomers that made the detection, using JWST to observe a Saturn-mass planet called WASP-39b which orbits very close to a sun-like star about 700 light-years from Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Previous observations of this planet with Hubble and Spitzer had given us tantalizing hints that carbon dioxide could be present,&#8221; Batalha said. &#8220;The data from JWST showed an unequivocal carbon dioxide feature that was so prominent it was practically shouting at us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide is an important component of the atmospheres of planets in our solar system, found on rocky planets like Mars and Venus as well as gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. For exoplanet researchers, it is important both as a gas they are likely to be able to detect on small rocky planets and as an indicator of the overall abundance of heavy elements in the atmospheres of giant planets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carbon dioxide is actually a very sensitive measuring stick&#8212;the best one we have&#8212;for heavy elements in giant planet atmospheres, so the fact that we can see it so clearly is really great,&#8221; said coauthor Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and director of the <a href="https://owl.ucsc.edu/">Other Worlds Laboratory</a>.</p>
<p>Stars and gas giant planets are made primarily of the lightest elements, hydrogen and helium, but the abundance of heavier elements&#8212;what astronomers call &#8220;metallicity&#8221;&#8212;is a critical factor in planet formation, Fortney explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to determine the amount of heavy elements in a planet is critical to understanding how it formed, and we&#8217;ll be able to use this carbon dioxide measuring stick for a whole bunch of exoplanets to build up a comprehensive understanding of giant planet composition,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Batalha&#8217;s team observed WASP-39b as part of a JWST Early Release Science program to study transiting exoplanets. A transiting planet passes in front of its star as viewed from Earth, enabling astronomers to analyze the starlight that passes through the planet&#8217;s atmosphere, where gases like carbon dioxide absorb certain wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>Using the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on JWST, the team obtained a high-resolution &#8220;transmission spectrum&#8221; showing the light transmitted through WASP-39b&#8217;s atmosphere separated into its component wavelengths. Batalha said the data yielded &#8220;exquisite light curves&#8221; and showed that the NIRSpec instrument is exceeding expectations for transmission spectroscopy. This bodes well for observations of small rocky planets, which are expected to have carbon dioxide in their atmospheres (when they have atmospheres) but won&#8217;t give as strong a signal as a giant planet like WASP-39b.</p>
<p>&#8220;This detection will serve as a useful benchmark of what we can do to detect carbon dioxide on terrestrial planets going forward,&#8221; Batalha said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the most likely atmospheric gas we&#8217;ll detect with JWST in terrestrial-size exoplanet atmospheres.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to carbon dioxide, the researchers detected another interesting feature in the spectrum of WASP-39b that they have not yet identified. &#8220;It&#8217;s a mystery feature for now,&#8221; Batalha said. &#8220;In this paper, we focused on a narrow range of infrared colors&#8212;this is only a preview of the features we expect to see in the full spectrum.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortney noted that WASP-39b appears to have a similar composition to Saturn. Saturn&#8217;s metallicity is 10 times that of the sun, and WASP-39b also seems to be enriched in heavy elements by about 10 times relative to the sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s super interesting, and we would love to know if all Saturn-mass planets have the same metallicity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was exciting to see this in another system, because we didn&#8217;t know what to expect when we went from the planets in our solar system to the atmospheres of exoplanets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Located in the constellation Virgo, WASP-39b is more than 20 times closer to its star than Earth is to the sun. Although it is about the same mass as Saturn, it is less dense and about 50 percent larger, probably due to heating from being so close to its host star. Previous observations showed it to have relatively clear skies, making it a good target for transmission spectroscopy.</p>
<p>When the first data from JWST were released in July, the UCSC exoplanet researchers were hosting 45 visiting astronomers for the Other Worlds Laboratory&#8217;s annual Exoplanet Summer Program. &#8220;We were all huddled around the laptop getting our first look at the spectrum and marveling at it,&#8221; Batalha said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a tremendous, almost euphoric feeling, seeing something for the first time that no other human has seen before&#8212;that&#8217;s what science is all about.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Batalha and Fortney, the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Team includes Xi Zhang, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC, postdoctoral fellows Aarynn Carter and Kazumasa Ohno, graduate student Sagnick Mukherjee, alumnus Zafar Rustamkulov (now a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University), and former postdoctoral fellow Natasha Batalha (now at NASA Ames), as well as a long list of coauthors around the world.</p>

But, in some states, they may have a harder time making their voices heard this year, in part, because it&#8217;s the first election following a redistricting cycle. New </span><a href="https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/rest_a_01204/111188/The-Targeting-and-Impact-of-Partisan?redirectedFrom=fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from UC Santa Cruz that focused on &#8220;swing states,&#8221; where political parties are evenly matched, suggests that whichever party controls the redistricting process in the state legislature engineers an 11 percentage point increase in its probability of winning a U.S. House race in the next election. And these advantages often run counter to the will of voters.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers attributed this effect to &#8220;gerrymandering,&#8221; which is the redrawing of voting district boundaries in ways that intentionally advantage one political party over the other. The redistricting process takes place every 10 years following the U.S. Census and is intended to ensure that each district remains representative of the state&#8217;s people as populations shift. But when this process is controlled by a state&#8217;s legislature, the party in the majority may instead shape districts strategically to either pack opposition voters into fewer districts or ensure a slight majority of their party's voters across a greater number of districts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, gerrymandering is a way for political parties to minimize the electoral impact of opposition voters without actually winning a greater share of votes. And to calculate just how much impact this can have, UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Economics Ajay Shenoy and World Bank economist Dahyeon Jeong applied data analysis techniques from the field of economics to study elections after redistricting cycles from 1970 to 2010 in hotly contested battleground states where legislatures controlled redistricting.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study&#8217;s unique methods applied &#8220;bunching tests&#8221; to real-world data to look for non-random patterns in election results that can only arise through strategic party behavior. And the finding that gerrymandering conferred an average 11 percentage point advantage in swing states was just the tip of the iceberg. The team also took a close look at the conditions under which these advantages arose and found that, in the election before a redistricting cycle, political parties systematically won narrow majorities in the legislatures of states where they had recently lost U.S. House races. Then, in the election after redistricting, the trend of that party&#8217;s losses at the federal level reversed, despite no change in their share of votes.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The deeper question of this work was not just a matter of whether parties that control redistricting use that to their advantage, but also where and why they wind up in control,&#8221; Shenoy explained. &#8220;And our findings suggest that parties seek control of redistricting in places where the electorate is turning against them, which is, in some ways, more concerning because it indicates that redistricting is being used to actively thwart the popular will.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenoy says parties seem to focus heavily on elections at the state level leading up to redistricting. They may strategically channel funds, delay retirements of incumbents, or prioritize particular election campaigns, all with the goal of winning a narrow majority in state legislatures where they have recently lost U.S. House seats. And if a political party succeeds in winning the majority, researchers found that they then switch from near-universal opposition to the new redistricting plan to near-universal support, demonstrating confidence that the process would work in their favor. A slightly larger share of Republicans than Democrats were willing to support a redistricting bill led by the opposition party.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study also documented some specific gerrymandering techniques. In particular, Republican legislatures were roughly 15 percentage points more likely than Democratic legislatures to move majority-Black census tracts to new districts, especially those districts that were already overwhelmingly Black.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That behavior might be consistent with racial gerrymandering,&#8221; Shenoy said. &#8220;You have a racial group that's visibly Democratic in its voting patterns, and these results may show how those voters are being packed into a smaller number of districts, where they have less of a chance of influencing the outcome of elections.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers identified another concerning trend that may warrant further research. Across most of the time period analyzed in the study, the initial advantage afforded to a party by gerrymandering would typically fade by the next election cycle, since continued shifts in voting trends ultimately outweighed redistricting advantages engineered on narrow margins. But when the team looked specifically at more recent data from the years 2001 through 2011, they found some evidence that the advantage of gerrymandering may be persisting longer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While more data is needed, this initial finding could be a warning sign. The research team suspects that increasingly sophisticated computer simulations of voter behavior, which have emerged since the mid-1990s, may be making gerrymandering easier and more effective than ever. Overall, Shenoy hopes the study&#8217;s findings may be useful to voting rights advocates and government authorities tasked with ensuring free and fair elections. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that federal courts could not judge cases of partisan redistricting, but legislators and state courts can still take action on these issues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;State supreme courts might be interested in this if their state constitutions have a guarantee of equal protection or equal representation,&#8221; Shenoy said. &#8220;We find fairly convincing evidence that partisan redistricting is substantially altering outcomes, especially in places where the electorate had been moving against a party, and that&#8217;s quite troubling if you are a court that believes it has a mandate to prevent that kind of thing.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d65a2b8d8072704629f12677525eba1c"><name>in-memoriam-audrey-stanley</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Audrey Stanley, Professor Emerita of Theater Arts</title><summary>Audrey Stanley was a beloved figure on campus, a pioneering faculty member closely associated with both Arts and Humanities divisions, and with Cowell College. </summary><start-date>1661410800000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: Audrey Stanley</display-name><path>/2022/08/in-memoriam-audrey-stanley</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/in-memoriam-audrey-stanley</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1661453609848</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1661453609848</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/05/images/audrey-stanley-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/05/images/audrey-stanley-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>audrey-stanley-500px.jpg</name><display-name>audrey-stanley-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>81347</file-size><width>500</width><height>326</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Audrey Stanley was born in Blackheath, London, on Monday, August 29, 1927. She was the second daughter of John Stanley and Alice (Smith) Stanley; her sister Joyce was eight years her senior. They lived over the Crown and Anchor beside the Thames in Woolwich, the inn that was the family business; however, because Audrey was declared &#8220;sickly,&#8221; they moved to the more salubrious seaside town of Whitstable on the north coast of Kent, where Audrey grew up very close to the sea. Living near London, she and her parents were regular theatregoers. From an early age she was taken to Christmas pantomimes where audience participation was encouraged; when still young she wrote and performed plays with friends.</p>
<p>She was educated at the William Gibbs Grammar School in nearby Faversham. Her years there coincided with the Second World War. Audrey nevertheless excelled at school; she had the good fortune to be taken with others to London to see productions with the great actors of the time, including Laurence Olivier and Alec Guinness. In 1946 she entered University of Bristol to study English and Philosophy; she chose Bristol rather than Oxford University because she observed that there were many women on the faculty there and the university evinced a more progressive attitude towards innovation and experimentation. When in 1947 Bristol established the first program in Drama in an English university, led by the eminent theatre historians Glynne Wickham, H. D. F. Kitto, and Bertram Joseph, Audrey with five others became the first students in the program, which involved study at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre. She graduated in 1950, by which time she had founded and been the president of the University Dramatic Society and directed its first tour to towns and villages in southwestern England; &#8220;Theatre should not be just for those in the cities,&#8221; she would say.</p>
<p>Upon graduating, she stayed another year to receive a Certificate of Education, a teaching qualification. She then spent a year as a schoolteacher in Yorkshire; taught for four years in an art school in Surrey; and served for eight years as a lecturer in two different teacher training colleges in the midlands, where she set up new programs in drama and taught a wide variety of courses including film making and appreciation. In 1965, when she was Senior Lecturer in Drama and Chair of the Drama Department at the City of Birmingham Training College, an opportunity arose for her to leave England. By coincidence, her doctor had recommended that she leave the English climate for the sake of her health.</p>
<p>After teaching the academic year in Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, she spent six months in Greece on a course at Delphi offered through the Dramatic Arts Department at Berkeley; Audrey had already been actively researching sites of Ancient Greek theaters. Inspired by this experience, which included stage managing a production in the theater at Delphi, in Fall 1966 she entered the newly established doctoral program at Berkeley as a means of advancing her research. When in 1970, after only four years, she completed her dissertation, which was accompanied by a film she made of three fifth-century BCE theater sites, she was the first student in the program to be awarded the Ph.D.</p>
<p>Audrey&#8217;s appointment in 1969 to the faculty at UCSC came at a critical moment for the future of theatre and of the arts in general on the campus. College Five (now Porter College) was to open in the Fall Quarter as the &#8220;arts college,&#8221; and that meant not only a great increase in the proportion of Arts faculty on campus but also changes in the curricula and administration of those fields, all of which were under the direction of the Division of Humanities. In the prior academic year, the Board of Studies in Literature had pressed for the establishment of Drama as a separate academic unit; previously faculty in Drama had been Lecturers in Literature on short contracts, providing courses most significantly through the colleges. In the spring of 1969, the Committee of Studies in Theater Arts was established. A few months earlier Audrey had been appointed as the first of two tenure-track appointments. At that time still lacking the doctoral degree, she was given the uncommon rank of Acting Associate Professor of Theater Arts. By the end of her first year, she had been awarded the degree and so became one of the first female tenured professors on campus and the first in Theater Arts.</p>
<p>Audrey&#8217;s leadership was fundamental in the development of Theater Arts. She embraced the union of drama, film, and dance, believing particularly in the need for students to be acquainted with filmmaking. She pushed for the appointment of faculty with diverse talents; attuned to the campus&#8217; openness to experimentation, she believed in the students&#8217; exposure to a great range of opportunities in their education. Although she was frustrated by the way in which the diminished budgets of the 1970s inhibited the expansion of Theater Arts, she was relentless in her quest for new positions and remained a powerful advocate for her department.</p>
<p>She was an excellent teacher, dynamic and demanding, setting very high targets for her students but always encouraging them as they confronted her challenges, asking them to respond imaginatively and to take risks; an admirer of Peter Brook and Joan Littlewood, she called her introduction to theatre course &#8220;Experiments in Theatre.&#8221; Her classroom was a place where practical activity was accompanied by an intellectual commitment to understanding and interpreting theatrical texts. Joy and delight in the communal activity were always manifest, but so were rigor and responsibility. She instilled in her students her own passionate involvement with the Ancient Greek dramatists and Shakespeare. Her first major production at UCSC was Aristophanes&#8217; The Congresswomen in May 1970, performed in the Quarry by two casts, one all male (as in Ancient Athens), the other conventionally gendered. Both were fine, entertaining comic performances; they were also instances of experiential research, examining (in a less gender-conscious period than the present) the representations of women and their relation to comic practice, particularly when the productions were presented in sequence on one scorching Sunday afternoon and evening. She did not, however, restrict herself to classic texts when she directed students in productions. Aristophanes and Shakespeare were featured, but she also directed plays by Ben Jonson, Henrik Ibsen, G&#252;nter Grass, Lee Blessing, and Emily Mann; she took particular delight in directing Oh What A Lovely War, a musical developed by Joan Littlewood&#8217;s company Theatre Workshop in London&#8217;s East End.</p>
<p>As a director she brought a meticulous attention to the language of the plays; she engaged in &#8220;word work&#8221; with her actors, taking them through the details of the words of their role, exploring possibilities and engaging imaginations. She rarely cut a Shakespeare text, manifesting an almost religious devotion to the Folio. In later years she conceded that responsible cutting could have positive consequences in performance; respect for the text replaced reverence of the text. Her productions were not notable for unique interpretive concepts or quirky readings. However, she liked to experiment with using new spaces to enlarge the audience&#8217;s experience. She performed the street fight that begins Romeo and Juliet in the plaza of the Performing Arts Complex before the audience moved inside to see the rest of the play enacted on the Main Stage. Her A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream took place in a meadow location opposite what would become the Sinsheimer-Stanley Glen; in this production, which also toured to other UC campuses, the audience sat on a large circular sheet while the action took place around them. This was not difference for difference&#8217;s sake, but a desire to see how the work would be created and operate in a new environment, and how the audience community could be constructed.</p>
<p>During the 1970s Audrey had an ambition to set up an annual festival of Greek theatre; she engaged in conversations about it with at least one prospective collaborating colleague, but nothing came of it. However, at the same time she began to receive invitations to direct Shakespeare plays at festivals. The founding Artistic Director of Ashland Shakespeare Festival (now the Oregon Shakespeare Festival), Angus Bowmer, invited her to direct The Winter&#8217;s Tale in the new indoor Bowmer Theater in 1975. She thus became the first woman to direct a Shakespeare play at Ashland, and the success of her production led to an invitation four years later to return to direct As You Like It. She directed Henry IV Part 1 at the Colorado Shakespeare Festival; Berkeley Shakespeare Festival engaged her to direct The Tempest. When, upon the death in 1980 of the eminent UCSC Shakespeare scholar Professor C. L. Barber, who had greatly admired her production of The Winter&#8217;s Tale, a group of faculty led by Professor Dane Archer proposed the establishment of a town-and-gown Shakespeare festival on the campus to honor his memory, Audrey was perfectly positioned to lead such an organization as Artistic Director. With characteristic boldness she persuaded Karen Sinsheimer, the new wife of Chancellor Robert Sinsheimer, to head the Board of Directors and they proved a dynamic pair.</p>
<p>She had numerous contacts among actors in the Royal Shakespeare Company in England as well as on the west coast of the U.S. She had for many years been connected with ACTER, an organization run by Professor Homer Swander of UCSB that brought troupes of five English actors, usually members or veterans of the RSC such as Tony Church, Julian Curry, Patrick Stewart, and Paul Whitworth, to tour US campuses, teaching classes and giving performances; Church and Stewart had enjoyed residencies on the Santa Cruz campus. Such contacts enabled her to envision a festival that would incorporate highly esteemed English actors with west coast, local, and UCSC student actors into an acting company performing plays in repertory, including non-Shakespearean works. She also saw a role for scholars; she believed that artists and academics could enhance each other&#8217;s work. The enterprise would be marked by imaginative creativity and intellectual responsibility. Such was the foundation of Shakespeare Santa Cruz, along with the identification of the Glen as an appropriate outdoor performance space that proved to be a fertile, versatile, magical, and much-loved venue.</p>
<p>What began in the summer of 1982 would prove to be Audrey&#8217;s greatest accomplishment: Shakespeare Santa Cruz and its successor company, Santa Cruz Shakespeare, have been an extraordinary gift to UCSC, to Santa Cruz, and to the theatre world. In the first season there were two productions: on the Main Stage King Lear, which she directed with two RSC actors, Tony Church and Julian Curry, and in the newly discovered Glen, later to be designated the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen, A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream. Forty years later the Festival continues to thrive, performing a full summer season in The Audrey Stanley Grove in DeLaveaga Park. During her period as Artistic Director she oversaw the initial development of the company: she increased the range of offerings presented in repertory and brought in new directors and actors, including Professor Michael Edwards, who succeeded her as Artistic Director in 1988, and Professors Danny Scheie and Paul Whitworth, who would follow Michael Edwards. She was unfailingly generous in her support of artists&#8212;directors, actors, designers&#8211;younger than herself. She had a particular desire to support women in their pursuit of careers in the theatre. She was always open to change, reluctant to frustrate what might be another&#8217;s dynamic approach or a genuine novel creative impulse.</p>
<p>Under successive artistic directors the Festival has grown into the current highly regarded professional Equity company that draws artists from across the country and runs a thriving intern program for young artists; the Festival has a national reputation. It has founded or developed the careers of numerous actors, directors, and designers. Hundreds of thousands of spectators have attended productions since 1982. It has staged all but seven of the Shakespeare plays, many several times; plays by dramatists as various as Tirso de Molina, Moli&#232;re, Ibsen, Chekhov, Shaw, Synge, Sartre, Beckett, Albee, and Mamet; and original winter holiday shows after the manner of English pantomimes, such as Cinderella and The Princess and the Pea written by Kate Hawley. Such a rich and varied diet of theatre is remarkable for a community of the size of Santa Cruz. The Festival has played and continues to play a major role in the city&#8217;s life; it has been responsible for introducing large numbers of local residents to the pleasure of live theatre and has had a lasting impact on many young people.</p>
<p>Audrey envisaged the Festival as contributing to the education of the general public and to the cultural enrichment of the local community. In 1982 she organized a discussion of the season&#8217;s plays between actors, university faculty, and local teachers; that event continues annually as Weekend with Shakespeare, a series of talks by scholars and discussions of the season&#8217;s plays, now organized by UCSC&#8217;s Shakespeare Workshop in collaboration with the Festival. In response to requests for presentations in local schools, the Festival developed Shakespeare To Go. In Spring Quarter each year Shakespeare To Go takes a shortened version of a play on tour to schools throughout Santa Cruz County and beyond. The program is now administered by UCSC&#8217;s Department of Performance, Play &amp; Design; the production is directed by a faculty member, but the organization and administration of the daily activities of the touring company are completely the responsibility of the students themselves, a manifestation of Audrey&#8217;s pedagogical principles at work. Currently Santa Cruz Shakespeare itself offers a week of matinees to local schools; each year as many as a thousand students attend them with their teachers.</p>
<p>She remained closely involved with the Festival for over forty years, devoting her life to its flourishing. However, Audrey&#8217;s dedication to theatre in Santa Cruz was not limited to the company she founded. She was also an ardent supporter of the city&#8217;s other professional theatre, the Jewel Theatre Company, which now resides in the Colligan Theater in the Tannery Arts Center. Until the last few months of her life, Audrey regularly attended the Jewel Theatre&#8217;s opening nights and was a generous financial supporter of the company on whose Advisory Committee she served.</p>
<p>Always fascinated by performance, Audrey rose to the challenge when invited to take to the Festival stage herself. Happy to be directed by others, she appeared in three Shakespeare Santa Cruz productions. She was a plaintive Duchess of Gloucester in Richard II in 1986, an Old Woman aiding Gloucester in King Lear in 1995, and most memorably a flying Puck in A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream in 1991. As Puck, Audrey made her spectacular entrances by zooming over the heads of the audience on a long descending zip-line fastened to a neighboring tree and landing stage-center&#8211;at the age of 63. The spirit of adventure and imaginative daring that she brought to the creation of the Festival was matched by her refusal at all times to be deterred from her aims. She was determined and persistent in the pursuit of her objectives; she did not like to take no for an answer. When in 2013 the UCSC campus decided to close Shakespeare Santa Cruz permanently, she joined an exploratory committee to investigate whether a new, independent non-profit company might be created to continue her legacy. At Audrey&#8217;s request, Patrick Stewart joined the advisory committee for this endeavor, placing her efforts in the national spotlight. The committee, with Audrey&#8217;s help and personal support, raised over $1.1 million to found Santa Cruz Shakespeare in 2014, and Audrey joined the new board of directors before transitioning to the role of &#8220;honorary director&#8221; in 2015. When the UCSC campus decided that after the 2015 season the Glen and other campus facilities would no longer be made available to the festival, she backed the effort to find a new venue. When a suitable site was located, she supported the project wholeheartedly and donated generously towards the construction of the playing space that bears her name, The Audrey Stanley Grove.</p>
<p>In retirement, Audrey did not confine herself professionally to directing, acting, going to plays, and promoting the Festival. She co-directed an NEH Institute at the Folger Shakespeare Library, and she regularly led workshops on the theatrical exploration of the Folio texts at the annual meetings of the Shakespeare Association of America, where she commanded great respect. She also returned to an earlier interest: playwriting. Having seen in 1984 an exhibition of Van Gogh&#8217;s work, in her mind she saw a play. After years of research she completed a play, Call Me Vincent, about Van Gogh and Gauguin which won an award in the New Works of Playwriting merit contest in 2005. Audrey reflected, &#8220;One of the things in retiring, I thought I would get back to playwriting and I found it fascinating because I suddenly realized that by doing that and learning what works, what doesn&#8217;t work, I began listening to Shakespeare&#8217;s plays entirely differently.&#8221;</p>
<p>As one of her former students observed, &#8220;She was a force of nature.&#8221; She was a visionary and a trailblazer. Small of stature, she was large in spirit, and indefatigable. Till late in her life she liked to fly to London and spend a week visiting those friends whom she called her &#8220;English family&#8221; and seeing one and sometimes two plays each day. As long as she could, she went to every performance in the Grove to greet people personally as they entered and to talk with them at intermission; she appreciated the fidelity and the intelligence of the audience. In her later years she still attended rehearsals regularly, sitting perfectly still over long periods watching the actors; if asked during breaks, she would make brief discerning and constructive observations. In her last season in 2021 she attended matinees, always sitting in the front row, delighting in being a part of an audience that she would describe as &#8220;breathing together&#8221; in their absorption with the stage action; the communal experience pleased her. After her youthful experience of the importance of the arts in communities during the Second World War, and in her devotion to Ancient Greek Theatre as an expression of urban identity, Audrey was profoundly committed to the role of the arts in a healthy society. She dedicated her life to enriching the lives of others through the theatre. It is fitting that the two performance spaces that bear her name are located in places dear to her heart&#8212;the UCSC campus and the city of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Audrey was a vibrant, witty, creative, strong-willed, and kindly woman who loved life and people; many will miss the distinctive sound of her laugh. On May 15 in the morning, she died in her Santa Cruz home with her beloved cat Lulu nearby. No immediate family survive her, but scores of friends, colleagues, fellow artists, and many generations of former students mourn her loss.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="db102a4c807270463bb2c7d36fd69049"><name>maltzahn-fairos-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>NSF award will support project to promote reproducibility in computer science</title><summary>With the support of a three-year, $900,000 grant from the NSF, Carlos Maltzahn will participate in collaborative research to increase the reproducibility of computer science research.</summary><start-date>1661529600000</start-date><path>/2022/08/maltzahn-fairos-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/maltzahn-fairos-award</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1661532645937</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1661532645937</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/carlos_350.png</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/carlos_350.png</link><site>news</site><name>carlos_350.png</name><display-name>carlos_350.png</display-name><file-size>205427</file-size><width>350</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Carlos Maltzahn.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/carlos_80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/carlos_80.png</link><site>news</site><name>carlos_80.png</name><display-name>carlos_80.png</display-name><file-size>16134</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Carlos Maltzahn.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Carlos Maltzahn (photo by Sullivan&#160;<span>Gaudreault).</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>With the support of a three-year, $900,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), Adjunct Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Carlos Maltzahn and the UC Santa Cruz Center for Research in Open Source Software (CROSS) will participate in collaborative research to increase the reproducibility of computer science research.&#160;<br/><br/>This grant comes from the inaugural year of an NSF initiative, called Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable (FAIR) Open Science Research Coordination Networks (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22553/nsf22553.htm">FAIROS RCN</a>), to create groups of researchers who lead by example to promote open science results and artifacts. Overall, 10 new project groups were funded to pool $12.5 million into creating open source communities, which foster a vibrant exchange of artifacts within common infrastructure.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;There's a huge shift going on,&#8221; said Maltzahn, director of UCSC CROSS. &#8220;I think it has to do with the realization of how much value the industry places on open source, and that open science and networks of expertise have to be more inclusive and involve stakeholders across academia, industry, government and open source communities. That becomes especially important when you talk about revitalizing U.S. high tech manufacturing.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>Maltzahn will work with the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2226407">Repeto project</a>, a group focused on practical reproducibility in computer science research. Reproducibility allows researchers to verify findings, accelerate the research process to more quickly gain insights, and have their products more widely used in research labs, classrooms, and industry. It also helps students gain a deeper understanding of the original researcher&#8217;s thought process.<br/><br/>Involving researchers from the University of Chicago and New York University, the Repeto project strives to make the reproducibility of computer science practical &#8211; where many experiments can be repeated cost-effectively. Overall, they will create infrastructure, teach and mentor students, lead workshops, and create community best practices related to this goal.<br/><br/>Through these efforts, Maltzahn and his collaborators hope to better understand and foster the &#8220;market of reproducibility&#8221; to ensure that artifacts, such as pieces of software, are available for replication, but that those artifacts are both useful and used.<br/><br/>&#8220;The aim of Repeto is that both creating reproducible artifacts is really easy, and consuming those artifacts is really easy,&#8221; Maltzahn said. &#8220;The overall thought is that convenient reproducibility artifacts will accelerate the cycle of research, so you will get a much faster succession of insights and a powerful toolkit to improve student training.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>UCSC&#8217;s role in this project will be to convene a world-wide program in 2023 called the &#8220;Summer of Reproducibility,&#8221; following the model of CROSS&#8217;s <a href="https://cross.ucsc.edu/programs/osreprogram.html">Open Source Research Experience</a> program, which matches students with mentors working on open source projects. Similarly, for the Repeto project, undergraduate students participating in the Summer of Reproducibility will work to replicate a published piece of research.<br/>&#160;<br/>This will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of the experiments they have repeated as compared to just reading about them, and allow the mentors to better understand what is needed in order for their work to be truly reproducible.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Maltzahn will collaborate with Assistant Director of UCSC CROSS Stephanie Lieggi to put on the Summer of Reproducibility. He will collaborate with lead principal investigator Kate Keahey, senior computer scientist at Argonne National Lab and CASE Senior Scientist affiliated with the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago, Haryadi Gunawi, associate professor of computer science at University of Chicago, and Fraida Fund, research assistant professor in electrical and computer engineering at NYU.<br/><br/>The University of Chicago researchers will focus on building and maintaining the infrastructure to make practical reproducibility possible. They will also convene workshops on topics around reproducibility. NYU will focus on best practices for teaching and applying reproducibility in the classroom.<br/><br/>With connections made through researchers interested in reproducibility as part of the <a href="https://reproducibility.acm.org/">Association for Computer Machinery Emerging Interest Group for Reproducibility</a> effort, Maltzahn and team have created an international steering committee for the project, involving people across disciplines including computer science, library science, and social science.<br/><br/>All of the 10 FAIROS RCN awardee groups are expected to work together in sharing artifacts and will have monthly meetings led by the program director. UC San Diego&#8217;s Supercomputer Center (SDSC) is also part of the cohort, making the UC system a major participant in this initiative. Members of the cohort such as the North Carolina Central University provide exciting outreach opportunities to students and faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority-Serving Institutions (MCIs).</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="db4d1ae8807270463bb2c7d34bdb721e"><name>katia-avilapinedo</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Full circle community</title><summary>As an Alumni Association Scholarship recipient now in her fourth year studying computer engineering, Katia Avila Pinedo  (Merrill ’24, computer engineering)  has not only benefited from UCSC’s strong community—she’s helped build and sustain it.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katia Avila Pinedo (Merrill &#8217;24, computer engineering) recognized early on the vital role that community can play in student success. That&#8217;s how Avila Pinedo, who hails from an educationally disadvantaged area near Los Angeles, immediately knew that UC Santa Cruz was the perfect fit for her.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The moment I stepped onto the campus, surrounded by the beauty of nature, I just knew this was the place for me. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. I could feel the community aspect and support,&#8221; Avila Pinedo says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an Alumni Association Scholarship recipient now in her fourth year studying computer engineering, Avila Pinedo has not only benefited from UCSC&#8217;s strong community&#8212;she&#8217;s helped build and sustain it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avila Pinedo has worked as a peer mentor for the MESA Engineering Program (MEP), which provides academic and personal support to encourage the academic success of aspiring engineering students&#8212;many of whom are first in their family to attend college or from historically marginalized backgrounds. She has also worked as Executive Lead for GraceHacks, a student hackathon that fosters a welcoming and supportive hackathon environment for women and non-binary students. In addition, she plays the violin with Mariachi Eterno de UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avila Pinedo says financial support combined with other UCSC resources have allowed her to experience much that the university has to offer and to give back to fellow students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My success and accomplishment have been because of community support,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It&#8217;s great to receive support from organizations like the Alumni Association that help financially, and also from places like MEP that help support students academically. Without financial support, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to invest in helping other students 10 hours a week because I&#8217;d have to spend that time working. The donors&#8217; contributions (to scholarship funds) are helping other students by helping me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wants contributors to scholarship funds to know that every gift helps.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want to tell them that it&#8217;s making an impact. Looking at the big picture, it might not seem like your individual contribution is making a difference. It is.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Financial support from the university is very helpful,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to worry about finances, which frees me up to focus on my studies. Otherwise I would be worried about food, my health, and housing security.&#160; And without scholarships, I would have been required to take out loans. The financial support really takes the pressure off me and my family.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avila Pinedo is currently working as a software engineering intern at Microsoft in Seattle. This fall, she will work as a CalTeach intern, as well as a full time research intern in the Tech for Good lab.&#160; UCSC&#8217;s CalTeach program supports undergraduate and transfer students interested in careers in education, and helps develop a pipeline of STEM teachers for California&#8217;s public schools. Tech 4 Good conducts research in social computing, exploring the intersection of computation systems and social interaction in order to develop systems that support flourishing in work, education, governance, and community engagement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avila Pinedo says UCSC has helped her discover a passion not only for engineering but for education. She dreams of helping future students by becoming a professor of engineering, and says UCSC is preparing her to achieve her goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love this place, I love these people, why can&#8217;t I help, too?&#8221; she says. And while her plans for grad school aren&#8217;t yet finalized, she&#8217;d be eager to return to UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to come back and support UCSC,&#8221; says Avila Pinedo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alumni Association Scholarship has provided financial assistance for UC Santa Cruz students for 31 years. The scholarship supports high-achieving </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">first-year and transfer students who are working hard to earn their degree while navigating financial hardship.&#160; Every student selected receives a $3,000 annual award until they graduate, as long as they maintain a good academic standing.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

<h2>Campus Badge Update</h2>
<p>The campus COVID-19 student badging system is no longer in use. The campus notification system remains in operation. When students test positive using a campus testing facility, notifications will be sent to the student&#8217;s instructors. All students who test positive (either on campus or off) have been asked to notify all of their close contacts, including their instructors.</p>
<h2>Isolation Update</h2>
<p><strong>COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>Most of our campus community is up-to-date on their vaccinations, and there are more therapeutics available now to reduce the severity of COVID. Students living in university housing who test positive for COVID-19 will need to isolate in place. For any roommates with underlying medical conditions, we have temporary accommodations available for the period their roommate is in isolation.</p>
<p><strong>Monkeypox (MPX)</strong></p>
<p>Students who test positive for monkeypox (MPX) may not isolate themselves in their on-campus residence. The isolation team will further instruct you about isolation at appropriate temporary accommodations.</p>

[Credit: ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO), J. Spilker et al (Texas A&amp;M), S. Dagnello (NRAO/AUI/NSF)]</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>While observing a newly-dormant galaxy using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), scientists discovered that it had stopped forming stars not because it had used up all of its gas but because most of its star-forming fuel had been thrown out of the system as it merged with another galaxy. If proven common, the results could change the way scientists think about galaxy mergers and deaths.</p>
<p>The team published their findings in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac75ea"><em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em></a>. Wren Suess, a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz, is a coauthor of the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we look out at the universe, we see some galaxies that are actively forming new stars, like our own Milky Way, and some that aren&#8217;t. But those &#8216;dead&#8217; galaxies have many old stars in them, so they must have formed all of those stars at some point and then stopped making new ones,&#8221; Suess said. &#8220;We still don&#8217;t yet understand all of the processes that make galaxies stop forming stars, but this discovery shows just how powerful these major galaxy mergers are, and how much they can affect how a galaxy grows and changes over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>As galaxies move through the universe, they sometimes encounter other galaxies. As they interact, each galaxy&#8217;s gravity pulls on the other. The ensuing tug-of-war flings gas and stars away from the galaxies, leaving behind streams of material known as tidal tails.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just what scientists believe happened to SDSS J1448+1010, but with a plot twist. The massive galaxy, which was born when the universe was about half its current age, has nearly completed merging with another galaxy. During observations with the HST and ALMA&#8212;an international collaboration in which the U.S. National Science Foundation&#8217;s National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) is a partner&#8212;scientists discovered tidal tails containing roughly half of the entire system&#8217;s cold, star-forming gas.</p>
<p>The discovery of the forcefully discarded material&#8212;equal to 10 billion times the mass of the sun&#8212;was an indication that the merger may be responsible for snuffing out star formation, and that&#8217;s something scientists didn&#8217;t expect.</p>
<p>&#8220;What initially made this massive galaxy interesting was that, for some reason, it suddenly stopped forming stars about 70 million years ago immediately following a burst of star-forming activity. Most galaxies are happy to just keep forming stars,&#8221; said Justin Spilker, an astronomer at Texas A&amp;M University and the lead author of the paper. &#8220;Our observations with ALMA and Hubble proved that the real reason the galaxy stopped forming stars is that the merger process ejected about half the gas fuel for star formation into intergalactic space. With no fuel, the galaxy couldn&#8217;t keep forming stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>The discovery is shedding light on the processes by which galaxies live or die, and helping scientists to better understand their evolution.</p>
<p>Because the new result is from a single observation, it is currently unclear just how common this tug-of-war and its resultant quiescence may be. However, the discovery challenges long-held theories about exactly how star formation stops and galaxies die and has provided scientists with an exciting new challenge: to find more examples.</p>
<p>&#8220;While it&#8217;s pretty clear from this system that cold gas really can end up way outside of a merger system that shuts off a galaxy, the sample size of one galaxy tells us very little about how common this process is,&#8221; said coauthor David Setton, a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh. &#8220;But there are many galaxies out there like J1448+1010 that we&#8217;re able to catch right in the middle of those crashes and study exactly what happens to them when they go through that stage. The ejection of cold gas is an exciting new piece of the quiescence puzzle, and we&#8217;re excited to try to find more examples of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spilker added, &#8220;Astronomers used to think that the only way to make galaxies stop forming stars was through really violent, fast processes, like a bunch of supernovae exploding in the galaxy to blow most of the gas out of the galaxy and heat up the rest. Our new observations show that it doesn&#8217;t take a &#8216;flashy&#8217; process to cut off star formation. The much slower merging process can also put an end to star formation and galaxies.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ebdf70a080727046589a7cadb09b6606"><name>fire-safety-awareness</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Campus fire safety and awareness</title><summary>Firefighters over the past week have extinguished two wildfires on our campus, both of suspicious origin.</summary><start-date>1661756400000</start-date><display-name>Campus fire safety and awareness</display-name><path>/2022/08/fire-safety-awareness</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/fire-safety-awareness</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1661814665356</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1661814665356</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Firefighters over the past week have extinguished two wildfires on our campus, both of suspicious origin.

<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Improved search</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;the new library features object detection which creates smart tags based on what is in each image. Need a photo of our redwoods? Just search for trees. Additionally, we are continuing to add additional tags to photos to support successful image searches.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Better organization</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;We&#8217;ve created a better system for sorting by creating three broad buckets that include: People, Places, &amp; Activities.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ability to search for specific people</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;we have the ability to tag people with their names so you can seach individuals and click the tag to find other photos of that person.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Easy to access upload links</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so others in our community can submit photos to be included in the library, and so much more!&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The photo library now includes more than 2,500 photos with more than 250 new pictures. Communications and Marketing&#160;will continue to take and add more photos in the year ahead.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ef7c55e28072704658b33552e869d39e"><name>vc-dei-anju-reejhsinghani</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC selects Anju Reejhsinghani as Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</title><summary>Anju Reejhsinghani has deep professional experience in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) work, both in the college classroom as an educator and as a senior administrator. </summary><start-date>1661842800000</start-date><display-name>Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</display-name><path>/2022/08/vc-dei-anju-reejhsinghani</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/vc-dei-anju-reejhsinghani</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1661875279309</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1661877736236</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Marc DesJardins</name><title></title><phone/><email>madesjar@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/anju-reejhsinghani-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/anju-reejhsinghani-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>anju-reejhsinghani-500px.jpg</name><display-name>anju-reejhsinghani-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>88325</file-size><width>500</width><height>332</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Anju Reejhsinghani</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/anju-reejhsinghani-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/anju-reejhsinghani-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>anju-reejhsinghani-80px.jpg</name><display-name>anju-reejhsinghani-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>35030</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Anju Reejhsinghani</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><br/>As VC DEI and Chief Diversity Officer, Reejhsinghani will partner with leadership campuswide to guide inclusivity efforts, working proactively to foster a more welcoming campus.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has selected Anju Reejhsinghani as its first-ever Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.</p>
<p>Reejhsinghani has deep professional experience in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) work, both in the college classroom as an educator and as a senior administrator. She comes to campus from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where she served most recently as Assistant Vice Provost for Strategic Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Administration. Previously she served as Executive Director at UW Madison&#8217;s Institute for Regional and International Studies. Before entering higher education leadership, she was a tenured associate professor in the Department of History and International Studies at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point, a four-year regional comprehensive campus.</p>
<p>Reejhsinghani&#8217;s appointment caps a national recruitment and campuswide stakeholder-engagement process that began in February; she begins her work at UC Santa Cruz on Sept. 12.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anju Reejhsinghani is an experienced DEI leader who has worked with students, staff and faculty,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;Understanding the nuanced perspectives of the many groups that make up our campus community is critical to successful DEI work. Her experience will help immensely as she partners with people around our campus to create a more welcoming and equitable institution. I&#8217;m thrilled that she&#8217;s joining our leadership team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larive praised the work of the VC DEI search committee, chaired by Vice Provost of Academic Affairs Herbie Lee, for bringing forth a strong slate of candidates. She also thanked all in the campus community who shared their insights during the VC DEI recruitment and stakeholder-engagement process. &#8220;We are grateful for the community feedback that helped to inform this process."</p>
<p>As VC DEI and Chief Diversity Officer, Reejhsinghani will partner with leadership campuswide to guide inclusivity efforts, working proactively to foster a more welcoming campus. The position will report directly to the chancellor and oversee the campus Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.</p>
<p>Reejhsinghani&#8217;s recent work at UW Madison touched nearly every corner of that campus. She reported directly to the university&#8217;s chief diversity officer and oversaw units in employee disability resources, affirmative action planning and programming, affinity group-based learning communities, and climate assessment, planning, and research. She was a key campus partner in the launch of new initiatives in DEI education and professional development for faculty and staff. She also co-chaired UW Madison&#8217;s Campus Climate Survey Task Force, which reviewed findings and developed recommendations for campus leadership from over 13,000 student survey responses; planned and directed an annual two-day hybrid Diversity Forum; and co-chaired campuswide award-selection committees recognizing research, teaching, community service, and advocacy on behalf of UW Madison&#8217;s communities of color and LGBTQ+ populations.</p>
<p>Reejhsinghani describes herself as an approachable, accessible leader who seeks to &#8220;lead by listening and being present. I let people know that I&#8217;m willing to reach them where they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said she initiates partnerships from a spirit of collaboration and an emphasis on shared values. &#8220;We all believe in access. We believe in supporting our communities. We believe in creating pathways to social advancement. With these as our goals, what DEI work really comes down to is thinking about what&#8217;s needed to get people there, then doing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>While some positions may seem to lend themselves more naturally to the work, she said, we all have something to contribute to that discussion. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want the conversation about DEI to be only about what can&#8217;t be done, but about what can be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>A historian specializing in the Asian and African diasporas, Latin America, and Latinx studies, Reejhsinghani was drawn to UCSC for a number of reasons, she said, including the campus&#8217; long history of student involvement in social movements and its many trailblazing academic programs. Having begun her teaching career as a lecturer in Asian American Studies, she specifically noted the Critical Race and Ethnic Studies program, which last year earned departmental status.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m impressed that UCSC has centered DEI in the academic enterprise,&#8221; she noted. &#8220;That can serve as a model for other R1 campuses nationwide.&#8221;</p>
<p>In joining UCSC, Reejhsinghani is excited to continue her professional trajectory at a public institution that shares the same commitment to broadening opportunity, expanding access, and building inclusive excellence that she found in the University of Wisconsin system, especially during her years as a faculty member working primarily with first-generation college students. &#8220;The Wisconsin idea, at its core, is about expanding the reach of public education to all. That same mission and energy is clearly evident at UCSC and in the wider UC system. It is an honor to accept this inaugural role and to help shape the agenda for how we can become a more inclusive, diverse, and equitable campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reejhsinghani holds a Ph.D. and a master&#8217;s degree, both in history, from the University of Texas at Austin. She earned a diploma in economics from the London School of Economics &amp; Political Science, and has a bachelor of arts in history from Princeton University, graduating summa cum laude.</p>
<p>Judith Estrada, Assistant Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, has served as interim Chief Diversity Officer since last summer. With Reejhsinghani&#8217;s appointment, Estrada will continue as the office&#8217;s assistant vice chancellor.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f0f61eac8072704658b335526a268f24"><name>vc-diversity-equity-inclusion</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC's first-ever Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</title><summary>We are excited to announce that Anju Reejhsinghani will serve as campus’ first-ever Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.

a three-year, $1.1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, which will fund his research on improving computer models for safety mechanisms within particle accelerators.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For this project, Lee will collaborate with scientists on the Advanced Photon Source (APS) Upgrade (APS-U) project at Argonne National Laboratory, the site of one of five of the U.S.&#8217;s ultra-bright light source facilities. These sites, called <a href="https://science.osti.gov/User-Facilities/User-Facilities-at-a-Glance/BES/X-Ray-Light-Sources"><span class="s2">X-Ray Light Source</span></a></span><span class="s3"> user facilities</span><span class="s1">, produce X-ray beams studied by scientists for a wide range of applications in medicine, biology, material science, astrophysics, and more.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The APS facility at Argonne National Lab is donut-shaped, with beams of electrons shot out from a linear particle accelerator in the center. The beams are then bent by magnets to travel in circles around the site at very close to the speed of light. When the electrons bend, they emit synchrotron radiation in the form of very bright X-ray light.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Amid this process, at some point, the electron beams must be stopped. This is what scientists call a &#8220;whole beam dump,&#8221; and special breakers, which are called collimators and made of solid metals, are used to prevent the beams from damaging the facility and injuring its employees when that happens. As the collimators stop the beams, they get scratched and damaged. The ongoing technical upgrade of the APS is expected to result in very intense electron beams, which will increase the damage to the collimators as they encounter extreme high-energy-density conditions that impact machine protection.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The crux of this project is to study these processes and ensure the integrity and reliability of the collimators. Lee&#8217;s role will primarily be to develop high-fidelity numerical models for the physics of the whole beam dumps with the new APS-U system. In addition to researchers at Argonne National Lab, Lee will collaborate with <a href="https://www.radiasoft.net/"><span class="s4">RadiaSoft</span></a>, whose physicists study accelerator particle physics as well as particle and material interactions.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Unlike many other typical proposals, this team has very unique expertise in different areas,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;This project is a fine example of how applied mathematics can help advance solutions to real world problems.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the last two years, Lee has been working on preliminary research into the gas dynamics of this problem with the support of seed funding from Argonne National Lab. The project team includes Lee&#8217;s former Ph.D. student Youngjun Lee, who worked on the initial studies with the seed funding and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Argonne. The funding will also support a new Ph.D. student in the UCSC Applied Mathematics Department.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lee uses <a href="https://flash-x.org/"><span class="s4">Flash-X</span></a>, a popular open-source community code for astrophysicists and high-energy-density physics, to develop his computational models. As part of the project, the team will deliver and make publicly available the numerical code for doing this research, making it available to the research community for the continuation of this pioneering work.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>

Trumpler Award, given annually by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific to a recent recipient of the Ph.D. degree in North America whose research is considered unusually important to astronomy.</p>
<p>Her dissertation, &#8220;Binary Neutron Star Mergers,&#8221; was integral in interpreting and analyzing one of the most important recent astrophysical events&#8212;the first detection of both gravitation waves and electromagnetic radiation coming from the same astronomical object. (See the <a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/neutron-star-merger/">UCSC Special Report</a> on this landmark event.)</p>
<p>Detected in 2017 and named GW/GRB170817, this neutron star merger engaged the astronomical community in intense research efforts and helped solve some key mysteries, including the origin of heavy elements (like gold and platinum) and the source of the short gamma-ray bursts detected in the cosmos. Murguia-Berthier worked with Enrico Ramirez Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, to provide a coherent theoretical framework for understanding the observations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ari is currently one of the best early-career scientists working in high energy astrophysics,&#8221; said Ramirez-Ruiz. &#8220;Her thesis shows unprecedented productivity and creativity as well as high impact. Ari&#8217;s scientific productivity, versatility, and depth have been remarkable, and I am delighted that she has been recognized with this magnificent award.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently a NASA Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow at Northwestern University, Murguia-Berthier already has an impressive publications record. By the time she had completed her doctorate, her 18 peer-reviewed articles had already been cited over 4,500 times. Of those, her seven first-author publications had been cited three hundred and fifty times. Her work appears in some of the most prestigious journals in science, including <em>Nature, Science,</em> and the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>
<p>Murguia-Berthier's main research interest continues to focus on studying the merger of compact objects through numerical simulations.</p>
<p>The Astronomical Society of the Pacific will celebrate Murguia-Berthier&#8217;s achievements at the ASP Awards Gala on November 19, 2022, in Burlingame, California.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f4edf404807270465a2acc6ac625f077"><name>contesting-race-and-citizenship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New book explores citizenship rights and Black anti-racist politics in Italy</title><summary>Associate Professor of Sociology Camilla Hawthorne’s latest book, Contesting Race and Citizenship, explores how Black Italians are fighting for change against the country’s restrictive citizenship laws. </summary><start-date>1661929200000</start-date><path>/2022/08/contesting-race-and-citizenship</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/contesting-race-and-citizenship</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1661966611437</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1661966611437</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/book-cover-hawthorne</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/book-cover-hawthorne</link><site>news</site><name>book-cover-hawthorne</name><display-name>book-cover-hawthorne</display-name><file-size>201402</file-size></image><image-alt>book cover showing a map of the mediterranean</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/08/images/book-cover-hawthorne-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/08/images/book-cover-hawthorne-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>book-cover-hawthorne-80.jpg</name><display-name>book-cover-hawthorne-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>23843</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>book cover showing a map of the mediterranean</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/04/images/hawthorne_380.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/04/images/hawthorne_380.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hawthorne_380.jpg</name><display-name>hawthorne_380.jpg</display-name><file-size>67387</file-size><width>380</width><height>308</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Professor of Sociology Camilla Hawthorne</span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Professor of Sociology Camilla Hawthorne&#8217;s latest book, </span><a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501762291/contesting-race-and-citizenship/#bookTabs=1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contesting Race and Citizenship</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, explores how Black Italians are fighting for change against the country&#8217;s restrictive citizenship laws. In Italy, citizenship is based primarily on descent or &#8220;blood,&#8221; which means children inherit citizenship if they have at least one Italian parent. But this system has meant that an estimated 600,000 to 900,000 Italian-born children of immigrants are not guaranteed citizenship in the country where they were raised. Among those are many Italians of African descent.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawthorne, who is herself the daughter of an African American father and an Italian mother, is a bilingual dual citizen who grew up splitting her time between the United States and Italy. Those experiences inspired her research into the unique and thorny intersections of race and citizenship in Italy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I'm an Italian citizen due to the same law that disenfranchises so many of my fellow Black Italians,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So I became really interested in understanding the racial histories of citizenship and how citizenship became a key strategy in Black anti-racist politics in Italy.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past decade, Hawthorne has delved into these topics, often by learning from and working alongside Black activists, artists, and entrepreneurs in Italy. She also studied media coverage of migration and citizenship issues in the country, explored the creative and philosophical work of Black Italians, immersed herself in relevant social media spaces, and dug through archives to trace the history of how race and geography relate to Italian national identity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contesting Race and Citizenship </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">shares findings from this research. The book sheds light on how a unique form of racism arose in the late-19th century as Italy sought to be accepted as European by differentiating itself from Africa. This new form of racial politics reimagined the Mediterranean as a dividing line, rather than the place of cultural, racial, and ethnic exchange that it had long been. Hawthorne sees echoes of this historical shift in the assertions of modern rightwing politians that Italy could lose its identity by being &#8220;overrun&#8221; with migrants and refugees from Africa. She says it has really only been within the last five to 10 years that Italian historians have begun to reckon with the country&#8217;s long history of racism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The prior common sense had been that, because Italy is this mixed Mediterranean nation, racial categories had always been really fluid until the influence of Hitler on Mussolini led Italy to become a racial state during the fascist period,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;But what the archives show is that the ideology of trying to define Italianness and Italian citizenship through race has been around as long as the state of Italy.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the social and historical context within which the Italian-born children of Black immigrants are now pushing for access to citizenship, and the book describes how activists have navigated that. Hawthorne says the movement is currently engaged in a careful balancing act. On the one hand, Black activists who were born in Italy are eager to assert their Italianness, and on the other, many also feel solidarity with first-generation migrants arriving from Africa. So they&#8217;re looking for ways to push for citizenship that don&#8217;t undermine the needs and rights of others.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Citizenship matters and brings material benefits, but it&#8217;s also a practice of exclusion, where someone will always be on the outside,&#8221; Hawthorne said. &#8220;So we also have to think about what kinds of solidarities get precluded when citizenship is the only focus. And what I&#8217;ve seen over time is that activists are still focusing on citizenship, but it&#8217;s not the end of their politics; they also see diasporic kin arriving as refugees and don&#8217;t think of those struggles as being separate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One area where Hawthorne sees a need for caution in how citizenship struggles are framed is the realm of Black entrepreneurship. Black-owned businesses are a source of immense pride and cultural celebration among Black Italians, and entrepreneurship has provided opportunities for women to build community and promote non-Eurocentric forms of beauty. But some entrepreneurs also hold up their economic contributions as evidence of their &#8220;worthiness&#8221; for citizenship, and this argument appears frequently in media coverage, too.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the book, Hawthorne discusses how this justification may backfire. She says it can be used to legitimize economic exploitation of immigrants and their children under the guise of celebrating &#8220;hardworking&#8221; individuals. At the same time, this line of reasoning marginalizes groups like refugees or people with disabilities who might be labeled as economically &#8220;unproductive.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contesting Race and Citizenship</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also details how building broader solidarities to combat anti-Black racism in Italy has required activists to develop a new vocabulary for social change. For example, while first-generation immigrants have traditionally been more likely to identify by their family&#8217;s specific country of origin, their children now also embrace terms like Black Italian or Afro Italian, in recognition of the shared experiences that come with growing up Black in Italian society. Activists have also had to adapt terms from other languages or define new ones to capture the unique circumstances of racial injustice in Italy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasingly, the movement has sought to navigate issues of race and citizenship in both local and global contexts. Hawthorne says the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 showed how exciting new forms of resistance and solidarity may arise from those efforts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Making Black lives matter in Italy means thinking about access to citizenship, the deaths of refugees crossing the Mediterranean, and the exploitation of undocumented migrants in agricultural labor, as well as police brutality,&#8221; she said. &#8220;During that moment, a lot of people were thinking about Black politics in Italy beyond just citizenship reform and seeing this whole constellation of issues that are connected through the regime of racial capitalism and colonialism. It&#8217;s a great example of how we can mobilize together across the diaspora.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="c9ec4823807270462612537c106df27a"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>August</title><start-date>1659340800000</start-date><display-name>August</display-name><path>/2022/08/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/08/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1639770245146</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1641091226717</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
