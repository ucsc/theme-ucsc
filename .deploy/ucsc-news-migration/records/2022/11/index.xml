Fishing vessels may disable their AIS devices, but a new analysis identifies intentional disabling events in commercial fisheries and shows that, while some disabling events may be for legitimate reasons, others appear to be attempts to conceal illegal activities.</p>
<p>The new study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abq2109">published November 2 in <em>Science Advances</em></a>, presents the first global dataset of AIS disabling in commercial fisheries, which obscures up to 6% of vessel activity.</p>
<p>First author Heather Welch, a project scientist in the <a href="https://ims.ucsc.edu/">Institute of Marine Sciences</a> at UC Santa Cruz, worked on the study with researchers at <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/">Global Fishing Watch</a>, which maintains an AIS dataset of vessel activity, and NOAA Fisheries. After Global Fishing Watch developed a way to distinguish intentional disabling from gaps in satellite coverage and other technical issues, Welch used a machine learning method to identify four primary reasons for AIS disabling.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some legitimate reasons why vessels disabled their AIS, but we found two situations in which it is done for potentially nefarious reasons, either to fish in unauthorized locations or to obscure unauthorized transshipments,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This dataset is now operationalized, and the data are produced in real time, so it can be used to target inspections and improve fisheries management.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the study, the researchers identified over 55,000 suspected intentional disabling events between 2017 and 2019, obscuring nearly 5 million hours of fishing vessel activity. More than 40% of the total hours obscured by suspected AIS disabling occurred across four hotspots, three of which are areas of concern for illegal fishing: the Northwest Pacific and areas adjacent to the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of Argentina and West African nations. These areas contain rich fishing grounds with limited management oversight.</p>
<p>&#8220;AIS data can tell us a lot, but so can the lack of it,&#8221; said coauthor Tyler Clavelle, a data scientist at Global Fishing Watch. &#8220;We might not always be able to see what vessels are doing, but knowing when they're intentionally hiding their movements provides valuable information that managers and scientists didn't have before. Having a better understanding of where vessels may hide their position allows authorities to deploy valuable on-the-water resources more strategically, supporting improved fisheries management.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disabling events were concentrated in waters adjacent to EEZ boundaries, suggesting that vessels may be disabling AIS before entering unauthorized locations to fish illegally. In many cases, vessels go dark as they approach the edge of an EEZ where they are not authorized to fish, Welch said. &#8220;For example, you might see a Korean-flagged vessel heading toward Argentina, and then it goes dark in international waters just outside of Argentina&#8217;s EEZ,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Notably, disabling was particularly common within and adjacent to EEZs with overlapping claims, such as the Falkland/Malvinas Islands that are disputed by the U.K. and Argentina. The political conflicts in these regions may create blind spots for enforcement.</p>
<p>Disabling events were also common in areas with high transshipment activity, where boats transfer their catches to refrigerated cargo vessels. Transshipment can be an efficient way to get the catch back to shore and resume fishing quickly, but it can also be used to obscure illegal fishing activity, effectively &#8220;laundering&#8221; the illegal catch through the cargo vessel. In addition, it can enable forced labor on fishing boats that never visit ports.</p>
<p>The study also found evidence that some disabling is done for legitimate reasons by vessels engaged in legal activities. In some cases, Welch said, AIS disabling may be done to hide the locations of good fishing grounds from competitors. The fourth disabling hotspot was caused by U.S. trawlers disabling in U.S. waters off the coast of Alaska. &#8220;This is one of the most intensely managed fishing grounds in the world, and these events likely constitute location hiding from competitors,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The other legitimate reason for disabling AIS is for protection from piracy. &#8220;Using a database of historical attacks, we can see that vessels switch off AIS in these historically dangerous waters, and that may be so that pirates aren&#8217;t able to track and intercept them,&#8221; Welch said.</p>
<p>The approach demonstrated in this study could be used to support surveillance and enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new dataset is an untapped resource that provides a real opportunity to detect previously unobserved behaviors and illegal fishing activities,&#8221; Welch said. &#8220;Authorities could use this information to decide where to send surveillance drones or patrol vessels, and it could also be used to focus port inspections on vessels that have disabled AIS adjacent to EEZ boundaries or in transshipment hotspots.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Education Hispanic Serving Institution grant will provide five years of funding to </span><a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/hsi-grants/cultivamos-excelencia2022.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultivamos Excelencia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charis Herzon, Hispanic Serving Institution Initiatives Director, is the Principal Investigator and Saskias Casanova, Assistant Professor of Psychology, is co-principal investigator on the grant, which will build a transfer-receptive culture for Latinx and low-income community college students to thrive in their transfer pathways to UC Santa Cruz, and beyond, opening opportunities to graduate studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is exciting to see how this research collaboration with the Services for Transfer and Re-Entry Students (STARS), which focused on understanding the lived experiences and strengths that transfer students of color bring to our campus, contributed to receiving the Cultivamos Excelencia HSI grant,&#8221; Casanova said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the grant support, I am eager to continue this work with our students, faculty, and staff colleagues as we develop and assess programming that intentionally centers the voices and needs of our transfer students of color and enhances transfer receptivity at UCSC.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz, a national leader as a Hispanic-Serving Research Institution, seeks to create systemic change that will improve and streamline these pathways and the lives of local community college Latinx, first-generation and low-income students and address issues of inequities of transfer, graduation, and advancing to graduate studies rates. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz has a long Latinx-serving history through student organizations, research, and academics. Earlier this year, UC Santa Cruz </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/seal-of-excelencia.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earned the Seal of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excelencia</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for intentional campus-wide efforts to serve Latinx students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Research Center for the Americas, established in 1992 and </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/rca-naming-dolores-huerta.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renamed in honor of Dolores Huerta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this month, is the first research center in the UC system to combine perspectives from the traditionally disconnected fields of Latinx ethnic studies and Latin American area studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, UC Santa Cruz faculty </span><a href="https://lals.ucsc.edu/graduate/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched the nation&#8217;s first Latin American and Latino Studies Ph.D. program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which offers an innovative transnational and interdisciplinary approach to the study of the peoples, cultures, societies and institutions of the Am&#233;ricas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same year, Latinx students made up more than 25 percent of UCSC&#8217;s undergraduate enrollment, making it the third UC to become a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) according to the U.S. Department of Education definition. Three years later, UC Santa Cruz was </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/hsi-award.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">awarded two Department of Education Title V grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help the campus increase achievement for Latinos and all students, as well as partner with San Jose City College to help transfer students earn their bachelor's degrees at a research university. The HSI Team has earned five multimillion dollar grants to </span><a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/hsi-grants/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advance educational equity, cultural inclusivity, and academic achievement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cultivamos Excelencia grant project aims to build and strengthen relationships with local community college colleagues and students; deepen understanding of transfer pathways at the departmental level and streamline the transfer process; and expand pathways for our transfers to participate in research and work toward graduate school, receive mentorship and foster connections with faculty.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What I value most about participating in this project is being able to foster a space of care and community where students can share their lived experiences at the university and how these experiences have impacted their academic careers,&#8221; Cultivamos Excelencia program coordinator Francia Cruz Silva said. &#8220;I am excited to develop and implement the Community College Partnership Program, which will develop meaningful relationships with our community college partners to better support and bridge the gap between the community college and the university"&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community college is the most common starting institution for Latinx students beginning their higher education journey. Transfer pathways also offer students a chance to re-engage with higher education if they left due to personal, family, or career needs, which were amplified by the Covid-19 pandemic.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Across higher education institutions, we see significant inequities in transfer rates among community college students of color into universities,&#8221; said Sara Radoff, STARS director. &#8220;The Cultivamos Excelencia HSI grant will enable us to innovate services and practices at UC Santa Cruz to intentionally serve transfer students of color. I'm most excited to continue partnering with students to understand their needs and activate learning into institutional change projects with my faculty and staff colleagues."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By enacting the interventions mentioned above, the Cultivamos Excelencia grant project will increase the number of newly enrolled Latinx transfer students by 10 percent; increase the number of degrees awarded to Latinx transfer students by five percent; further develop Latinx transfer students&#8217; sense of belonging; encourage Latinx transfer students&#8217; intention to attend graduate school; and expand the capacity at UC Santa Cruz to serve our transfer students of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It's not very often that researchers get the chance to put into practice research that can support transfer students of color, so I'm very excited to continue to engage in this process,&#8221; said Valeria Alonso Blanco, a psychology doctoral student researcher. &#8220;I also know many graduate students look forward to mentoring transferring students and supporting them in their path toward graduate school."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To advance efforts to increase opportunities for those historically underserved by higher education, UC Santa Cruz earlier this year </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/alliance-hispanic-serving-research-universities.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined other leading universities to form the Alliance of Hispanic Serving Research Universities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A coalition of 21 research universities, the alliance is working to double the number of Latinx doctoral students enrolled at member universities and increase by 20% the Latinx professoriate in member universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz holds the distinction of being only one of four institutions in the Association of American Universities that is both an HSI and an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution. The campus is continuing to advance and strengthen its work as a Hispanic-Serving Institution and is working to develop equity-minded partnerships that span across the region, state, and nation and through the academic pipeline.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="392ab7018072704662d78461a903883a"><name>flu-vaccination</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Flu vaccination requirement for UC faculty, other academic appointees, and staff</title><summary>We are reaching out today with additional information about requirements for compliance with the flu vaccination.</summary><start-date>1667372400000</start-date><display-name>Flu vaccination requirement for UC faculty, other academic appointees, and staff</display-name><path>/2022/11/flu-vaccination</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/11/flu-vaccination</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1667406411501</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1667406411501</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>Vaccination against influenza is an important measure in protecting the health of our communities based on a review of guidance from public health authorities and scientific studies, as well as consultation with UC experts.

A new report presents an ambitious plan to make major advances in understanding subduction zone hazards by bringing together a diverse community of scientists in a long-term collaborative effort, deploying new instrumentation in subduction zones, and developing more sophisticated and accurate models.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://purl.stanford.edu/hy589fc7561">report</a> from the <a href="https://www.sz4d.org/">Subduction Zones in Four Dimensions (SZ4D)</a> Research Coordination Network has been years in the making. After a 2016 workshop produced a &#8220;Vision Document&#8221; for the initiative, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the Research Coordination Network to develop a detailed plan. Through a series of meetings, workshops, webinars, and town halls to engage the U.S. research community and solicit input, the SZ4D initiative identified community priorities and the key infrastructure requirements and science activities needed to better understand geohazards and reduce their risks to society.</p>
<p>The implementation plan presented in the new report will inform ongoing discussions with NSF and other agencies regarding funding for the initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a huge community effort,&#8221; said Emily Brodsky, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz and chair of the SZ4D steering committee. &#8220;This is the right time to put serious resources into the question of whether these events are predictable or not. That&#8217;s something we&#8217;re poised to address now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Subduction zones are found around the world, mostly in coastal regions where an oceanic plate dives beneath a continental plate. The resulting geohazards include the largest earthquakes and tsunamis, active chains of volcanoes, and large landslides. Many large population centers are situated along subduction zones and are vulnerable to these hazards.</p>
<p>In the United States, the greatest risk is associated with the Cascadia subduction zone off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. According to Brodsky, however, Cascadia is not the best place to concentrate research efforts because it moves so slowly. The Chilean subduction zone is geologically active enough to provide useful information and is a good locale for comparative studies with Cascadia and Alaska. The SZ4D implementation plan recommends deploying instruments at all three sites, but with most of the observational efforts in Chile (70% of the instrumentation), along with a substantial portfolio of scientific activities in Cascadia and Alaska.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be able to translate what we learn in Chile to Cascadia and Alaska,&#8221; Brodsky explained. She said the initiative has already begun building partnerships with Chilean scientists and international groups studying the subduction zone there.</p>
<p>The implementation plan involves a major effort to improve observations of subduction zones in a systematic way, collecting a diverse set of measurements at a range of temporal and spatial scales both on land and under the sea. The infrastructure required for this includes extensive arrays of instruments to monitor different facets of subduction zone behavior as well as volcanoes and surface and environmental conditions related to landslides. In addition, the plan calls for researchers to study the geologic context, conduct laboratory experiments, and build computational models that integrate field observations and laboratory data.</p>
<p>The plan also emphasizes the need for close coordination among all components and deep integration throughout the program. The initiative brings together a diverse community of scientists and stakeholders with a wide range of geoscience backgrounds and expertise related to earthquakes, volcanoes, and surface processes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a complicated problem, and solving it requires stitching together a lot of different pieces. It&#8217;s not enough for individual scientists to focus on their individual pieces,&#8221; Brodsky said. &#8220;We need the infrastructure and the science, as well as the organizational structure to integrate all the pieces of the puzzle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Major advances in understanding the science behind subduction zone hazards could yield tangible benefits for communities in the affected regions, including the possibility of useful forecasts of large earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not promising that we will be able to predict anything, but we need to figure out if our inability to predict these things is related to the fundamental properties of the system, or because we just haven&#8217;t had the instruments in the right place at the right time,&#8221; Brodsky said.</p>
<p>George Hilley at Stanford University served as lead editor of the report. The SZ4D initiative is organized into three working groups (Landscapes and Seascapes, Faulting and Earthquake Cycles, and Magmatic Drivers of Eruption) and two integrative groups (Building Equity and Capacity in Geoscience and Modeling Collaboratory for Subduction), with a total of 74 members from 55 universities and institutions. The next SZ4D Community Meeting will be held November 14 to 16 in Houston.</p>

<p><span>State Parks will burn roughly 300 acres of a variety of forest habitats. The ignitions are scheduled to occur between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monitoring and patrol will continue through the following week and weekend. All burning will depend on weather and air-quality conditions that are favorable for smoke dispersal. If the conditions are not conducive for burning, the burns will be rescheduled.</span></p>
<p><span>Some trails will be closed temporarily to ensure public safety, including portions of the Englesmann Loop, Eucalyptus Loop, Old Cabin and Long Meadow Trail.&#160; Everyone is advised to keep clear of the designated zone during the scheduled burn. Smoke may be noticed in the area for one to two days after the burn.</span></p>
<p><span>This burn is part of the prescribed fire program for vegetation management, hazardous fuel-load reduction, wildlife-habitat improvement, and other ecological benefits.The treatment will enhance the health of the forest by removing duff, leaf litter and fuel buildup and restore essential nutrients to the soil and reduce the chance of wildfires.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>WHAT TO DO:</strong> </span><span>If you are affected by air-quality issues, stay indoors or leave the immediate area. Close windows until the burn has concluded. You can find information on the Air Quality Index (AQI) and local air-monitoring resources online. In addition, Environmental Health &amp; Safety provides information on wildfire smoke and ways to protect yourself.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>REDUCE EXPOSURE:</strong> </span><span>If the AQI is in the unhealthy, very unhealthy, or hazardous ranges, limit your outdoor activities and stay inside with the windows and doors closed, or if possible, leave the area. Drink plenty of fluids to keep your airway moist and easier to clear. If you are feeling ill due to poor air quality, seek advice from your medical provider.</span></p>

<p><span>Five committees, each focused on a thematic area and composed of a diverse group of campus stakeholders, have begun to meet. The membership and charge of each committee can be found on our </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/strategic-plan/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1667597579129000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1KKKwRYM6sFw8YjNEnkXWl" href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/strategic-plan/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Leading the Change website</span></a></span><span>. The committees are charged with broad engagement of campus stakeholders to identify opportunities for improvement related to their theme and propose measurable indicators of progress and success. In winter quarter, the committees will begin presenting the priorities that are emerging in their work and ask the greater campus community for input and feedback through a number of mechanisms including a campus survey.</span></p>
<h3><span><strong>Working together on community safety</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>We are restarting our Safe Ride program. The nightly van service on our residential campus was stopped in 2020 shortly after the start of the pandemic. The revamped program will be managed by TAPS. Students will be able to go online, fill out a ride request, and a van will shuttle them anywhere on campus. Details are still being finalized, but organizers hope to have it up and running after the November holiday break. More details are coming soon!</span></p>
<p><span>We are lucky to live, work and study in a remarkably beautiful setting and I am grateful to our whole campus community for sharing the responsibility of promoting safety.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roman Reggiardo, Biomolecular Engineering and Mathematics Program Ph.D. candidate and Bioinformatics Summer Bridge instructor, witnessed this success firsthand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bioinformatics field was new territory for many of the summer program participants, Reggiardo says&#8212;many didn&#8217;t even realize the area of study existed. By the end of the summer program, however, it was something they were interested in pursuing as a career pathway.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of our students who was on scholarship is now doing a programming internship at NASA&#8217;s Ames lab,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Genomics Institute began the Summer Short Course in Bioinformatics and Coding, and the Bioinformatics Summer Bridge Course in 2021. These courses&#8212;designed for for community college students and incoming UCSC students&#8212;strengthen a sense of belonging and broaden participation in genomics for first-generation college students and other historically underrepresented groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Summer Short Course in Bioinformatics and Coding, taught online over the course of four weeks, provides students with fundamental skills in programming, data management and visualization, scientific research, and the study of genomics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gepoliano Chaves, a Science Without Borders fellow and SIP mentor working with the pediatric cancer neuroblastoma at the University of Chicago under Dr. Mark Applebaum, is an instructor for the course &#8211; having worked with Dr Raja GuhaThakurta for 7 years, whose course served as inspiration for the Genomics Institute&#8217;s new programs. Chaves notes the incredible impact the program has on students&#8217; education and future careers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It's pretty much 90 to 95% of students, who have never had an experience with programming, and it&#8217;s the first time they hear about biological concepts like DNA sequencing technologies,&#8221; Chaves said. &#8220;It's an opportunity to get them exposed to that and have the mindset of what is expected or what's going to be expected from them in their academic year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zia Isola, the Diversity Director of the Genomics Institute Office, was inspired by astronomy professor Raja GuhaThakurta&#8217;s introductory python program. After seeing GuhaThakurta&#8217;s success in teaching students fundamental programming technical skills online and in a rapid and efficient timeframe, Isola had only one question:&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t we doing this for our [Genomics] students?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isola, knowing that community college and transfer students rarely&#8212;if ever&#8212;have the chance to take Computer Science or Bioinformatics, saw a need for a way to bridge the educational gap. The Summer Short Course provides an introduction to Genomics for students who would normally find such courses inaccessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Course participants, many of whom have little to no experience in programming or bioinformatics, spend a month with Ph.D. level practitioners and researchers, gaining connections and skills.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If they can do an intensive where they get these basic skills, then they can start applying them right away,&#8221; Isola says.&#160; &#8220;We want students to leave the workshops equipped with things that they can apply right now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaves sees the incredible potential put in the hands of his students through skills learned in the Summer Short Course.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you think about a disease like cancer, you need to understand a lot about the genetics and the gene expression that's going on, and you cannot study or understand that without going through learning these techniques,&#8221; Chaves says.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Genomics Institute seeks to expand their program and provide access to these vital scientific skill sets, Isola still makes sure that these Bioinformatics courses stay true to their ideal of broadening participation even in the pedagogy of their instructors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We're not just talking about reaching out to diverse participants,&#8221; Isola says.&#8220;We&#8217;re thinking about what we need to do on our end to make sure that our methods are inclusive and to make sure teaching is opening a door rather than putting up barriers.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With courses like the Summer Short Course in Bioinformatics and Coding, and the Bioinformatics Summer Bridge Course, the Genomics Institute is throwing doors wide open.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a second time, UC Santa Cruz has secured grant funding from The Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN). Leaders of PIT-UN &#8212;&#160; a partnership assembled by New America and the Ford and Hewlett foundations that supports 48 colleges countrywide in their pursuit to be inclusive in the wake of new technological advancements &#8212; announced a total of $2.3 million in funding at its annual gathering in New York City on Friday.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=smfalcon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sylvanna Falc&#243;n</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, associate professor of Latin American and Latino Studies and director of the Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas, is the successful recipient of the award and will work with a team of researchers &#8212; </span><a href="https://humanrights.berkeley.edu/about/staff-profiles/alexa-koenig"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexa Koenig</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://humanrights.berkeley.edu/about/staff-profiles/stephanie-croft"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie Croft</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of UC Berkeley&#8217;s Human Rights Center and </span><a href="https://law.ucla.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/jessica-peake"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Peake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Promise Institute for Human Rights at UCLA School of Law &#8212; for 16 months to evaluate and instruct around environmental crimes, which disproportionately affect marginalized communities in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falc&#243;n and her UC colleagues will be advancing their existing work with students that builds their investigative skill sets while supporting Latin American human rights organizations that would benefit from the added research support to complete comprehensive open source research. The UC faculty and students involved gather information from afar that helps their southern counterparts prepare to collect facts online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Environmental crimes are happening in precarious and dangerous conditions, and our research labs are often working at a safe distance,&#8221; Falc&#243;n said. &#8220;We are not experiencing surveillance in the same way that defenders are on the ground.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an expansion of the work of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Network for Human Rights and Digital Fact Finding, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which includes a group of more than 100 student and community partner technologists that are uniquely diverse. The UC labs are majority women of color who identify as bilingual or multilingual, immigrant or first-generation. Approximately thirty of these researchers attend UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been an unexpected career highlight to be able to work with such a richly diverse student community and to be able to empower them with these digital literacy skills,&#8221; Falc&#243;n added. &#8220;As you can imagine, the landscape of disinformation online has become so toxic and extensive that we are not short of work that we have to do.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falc&#243;n&#8217;s fellow scholar Peake hopes that her work toward fighting for fundamental human rights will translate into real-world accountability for those responsible for environmental harms and reparations for those most affected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Environmental harms are one of the biggest challenges facing humanity&#8230; We need to devote significant time and resources to holding accountable those who are hurting our global community, whether through extraction, pollution or destruction,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Under-resourced, under-represented and indigenous communities are often disproportionately affected by exploitative extractive industries and climate change, and we see this throughout Latin America where environmental human rights defenders have been subject to horrific attacks and worse by corporate actors.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a mission that resonates with program trainees, individuals who often come from underrepresented backgrounds. Graduates of the program have benefited from the hands-on mentoring from faculty and have gone on to launch careers in social justice after having made an immediate difference; past investigators, for example, had contributed to public reports on the 2019-20 uprisings in Chile all before receiving a degree.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/laptop-kiosk/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laptop kiosks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a collaboration between Information Technology Services and the University Library, were installed earlier this year. The program was created following conversations last academic year with students who asked for easier ways to borrow a laptop.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We strive to be a university that truly serves students and listening is part of that,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said during an event last week to celebrate the project. &#8220;Free and quick access can mean the difference between success and a missed assignment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past month, the laptops have been checked out 400 times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each kiosk is equipped with 24 Dell laptops running Windows and 12 chargers. Each laptop can be checked out for free on a first-come, first-served basis for up to 4 hours. Student information and work is automatically erased when it&#8217;s returned. The laptops include the </span><a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/software/student-software.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same applications and software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available to students through their CruzID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students can also participate in a survey at the kiosks to provide feedback on ways to improve and enhance the program. Since launching, more than 300 surveys have been completed with a satisfaction rate of 90 percent.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="591468a98072704602a1e466cd072039"><name>stay-informed</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Stay informed about the UAW labor strike</title><summary>The United Auto Workers—the union that represents University of California postdoctoral scholars, academic researchers, and graduate students employed as researchers, instructors, teaching assistants, tutors, and readers—is holding a systemwide labor strike at UC campuses.</summary><start-date>1671177600000</start-date><display-name>Stay informed</display-name><path>/2022/11/stay-informed</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/11/stay-informed</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1667941820568</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1672696540374</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><h3>NEWS: University of California graduate student workers end strike, ratify three-year contracts</h3>

The shredding of the star, known as a &#8220;tidal disruption event&#8221; or TDE, produced a flare of radiation that briefly outshone the combined stellar light of the host dwarf galaxy and could help scientists better understand the relationships between black holes and galaxies.</p>
<p>The flare was captured by astronomers with the <a href="https://yse.ucsc.edu/">Young Supernova Experiment</a> (YSE), a survey designed to detect cosmic explosions and transient astrophysical events. An international team led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz, the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen, and Washington State University reported the discovery in a paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01811-y">published November 10 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This discovery has created widespread excitement because we can use tidal disruption events not only to find more intermediate-mass black holes in quiet dwarf galaxies, but also to measure their masses,&#8221; said coauthor Ryan Foley, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz who helped plan the YSE survey.</p>
<p>First author Charlotte Angus at the Niels Bohr Institute said the team&#8217;s findings provide a baseline for future studies of midsize black holes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that we were able to capture this midsize black hole whilst it devoured a star offered us a remarkable opportunity to detect what otherwise would have been hidden from us,&#8221; Angus said. &#8220;What is more, we can use the properties of the flare itself to better understand this elusive group of middle-weight black holes, which could account for the majority of black holes in the centers of galaxies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supermassive black holes are found at the centers of all massive galaxies, including our own Milky Way. Astronomers conjecture that these massive beasts, with millions or billions of times the mass of the sun, could have grown from smaller &#8220;intermediate-mass&#8221; black holes with thousands to hundreds of thousands of solar masses.</p>
<p>One theory for how such massive black holes were assembled is that the early universe was rampant with small dwarf galaxies with intermediate-mass black holes. Over time, these dwarf galaxies would have merged or been gobbled up by more massive galaxies, their cores combining each time to build up the mass in the center of the growing galaxy. This merger process would eventually create the supermassive black holes seen today.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can understand the population of intermediate-mass black holes out there&#8212;how many there are and where they are located&#8212;we can help determine if our theories of supermassive black hole formation are correct,&#8221; said coauthor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and Niels Bohr Professor at the University of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>But do all dwarf galaxies have midsize black holes?</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s difficult to assert, because detecting intermediate-mass black holes is extremely challenging,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz said.</p>
<p>Classic black hole hunting techniques, which look for actively feeding black holes, are often not sensitive enough to uncover black holes in the centers of dwarf galaxies. As a result, only a minuscule fraction of dwarf galaxies is known to host intermediate-mass black holes. Finding more midsize black holes with tidal disruption events could help to settle the debate about how supermassive black holes form.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the biggest open questions in astronomy is currently how supermassive black holes form,&#8221; said coauthor Vivienne Baldassare, professor of physics and astronomy at Washington State University.</p>
<p>Data from the Young Supernova Experiment enabled the team to detect the first signs of light as the black hole began to eat the star. Capturing this initial moment was pivotal to unlocking how big the black hole was, because the duration of these events can be used to measure the mass of the central black hole. This method, which until now had only been shown to work well for supermassive black holes, was first proposed by Ramirez-Ruiz and coauthor Brenna Mockler at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;This flare was incredibly fast, but because our YSE data gave us so much early information about the event, we were really able to pin down the mass of the black hole using it,&#8221; Angus said.</p>
<p>This study was based on data from observatories around the world, including the W. M.

<p><a href="https://ims.ucsc.edu/people/directory-page1.php?uid=sbrodie">Stephanie Brodie, </a>an assistant project scientist with the Institute of Marine Sciences and a long-term affiliate of NOAA, received a three-year, $500,000 grant to work with the four California marine sanctuaries (Channel Islands, Monterey Bay, Cordell Banks, and Greater Farallones) to project climate impacts on marine predators and their prey across the West Coast. Brodie is the lead principal investigator, working with colleagues at the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Services and the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries.&#160;</p>
<p>Brodie&#8217;s research will primarily focus on protected species, whales, turtles, fish, sharks, and seabirds, and how they may be influenced by climate change as they move in and out of Sanctuaries as the ocean gets warmer.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;California&#8217;s marine sanctuaries need indicators of how climate change will impact them,&#8221; said Brodie. &#8220;We are looking at how species will shift their habitats in the future to&#160; prepare managers for change.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://oceansci.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=fiechter">Jerome Fiechter</a>, an associate professor in the Ocean Sciences Department, also received a three-year $513,000 grant from NOAA working with the same four California sanctuaries. Fiechter&#8217;s research, however, uses numerical models to understand past, present, and future population changes of keystone species for California coastal ecosystems, such as krill and anchovy. Fiechter is the lead principal investigator, working with colleagues at NOAA and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought when conditions were warmer, sardines would be more prevalent, and when it&#8217;s colder, anchovies would be more prevalent,&#8221; said Fiechter. &#8220;But between 2014-16, the ocean was abnormally warm on the West Coast, and the anchovy population exploded. So we are building models to understand these&#160; ecosystem surprises and better predict them in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brodie and Fiechter&#8217;s work also fits into the campus&#8217;s larger research initiative to address climate change in coastal regions in California and beyond. <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/07/keynote-state-budget.html">The Center for Coastal Climate Resilience</a> was announced this summer and named a new director this month.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5dee4f45807270462d16b99c43756fb3"><name>astronomy-mentoring-network</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New astronomy network catalyzes scientific excellence</title><summary>A new STEM mentoring network seeks to maximize scientific excellence and output within the astronomy and astrophysics community by cultivating inclusive environments where people with marginalized identities can thrive.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new STEM mentoring network seeks to maximize scientific excellence and output within the astronomy and astrophysics community by cultivating inclusive environments where people with marginalized identities can thrive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funded by the Heising Simons Foundation, the network&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsolved Problems in Astrophysics: A Network to Revolutionize Our Understanding of the Universe Through Inclusive Workplaces and Equitable Practices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;aims to create spaces for faculty and graduate students so they can create cutting edge science, says UC Santa Cruz astronomy professor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz. He is among the group of astronomers and astrophysicists who bring a broad range of scientific expertise and pedagogical approaches to the network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The network crosses institutional boundaries and establishes a formal support structure for faculty from historically marginalized communities in STEM, with the purpose of pushing science towards excellence. Each scientist brings unique expertise to the network, enabling members to collaborate and co-mentor students&#8212;ultimately bringing new and creative ideas to unsolved areas of astrophysics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The network is the first significant and sustained effort of its type in the field of astronomy and astrophysics. It goes beyond current efforts to diversify the field, with the understanding that improving workplace experiences significantly increases the creative output of the workforce and thus impacts scientific excellence overall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The network was inspired as a result of a national Decadal Survey panel, co-chaired by Ramirez-Ruiz, that looked at the investment of human capital in science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For the first time in the history of the field&#8212;perhaps in the history of science&#8212;the Decadal Survey created a panel, the State of the Profession panel, to look at not only how agencies invest in software, hardware, equipment, but how they must invest in people,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz explains.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are never going to be truly scientifically excellent until every single voice is at the table,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathryne (Kate) Daniel, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">associate professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona and an associate astronomer at Steward Observatory</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was a key member of the panel with Ramirez-Ruiz.&#160; She emphasized the importance of mentorship networks, noting that they have been shown to more effectively support students, and academics at all stages, in terms of retention, sense of belonging, and feeling valued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In some sense, the panel itself was a demonstration of how having a network of support and a truly diverse set of thinkers can achieve something truly novel and impactful,&#8221; Daniel says. &#8220; It was our very composition that created the generative, innovative atmosphere that allowed us to write a report I am very proud of.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> received multiple awards including being named the Inaugural Distinguished Vera Rubin Visiting Professorship at UC Santa Cruz (2021), a Scialog Fellow (2019) and an AAUW Fellow (2015).&#160; In 2020, Daniel co-founded the Society of Indigenous Physicists. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel is one of a small handful of astronomy faculty in the world who are of Indigenous ancestry.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies show that academic institutions largely do not represent the demographics of the national population, reflecting significant underrepresentation of those from historically marginalized groups. According to Ramirez-Ruiz, of the 38 astronomy departments in the country, 16 departments have only one historically marginalized faculty member identifying as Indigenous, Black, or Latinx. UC Santa Cruz&#160; and the University of Arizona have two faculty members from historically marginalized backgrounds&#8212;the remaining 20 departments have none.&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Mentoring success(ion)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The faculty participating in the network have a proven record of success as research advisers and have already built, as a model for the more formal network, spaces for creative co-collaboration and co-mentoring that have led to the training of students in a novel approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura Lopez, associate professor of astronomy at the Ohio State University, and Sarah Ballard, professor of astronomy at the University of Florida co-mentored Romy Rodriguez Martinez, a graduate student at Ohio State University, who was recently selected as a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NASA ExoExplorer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-mentorship by Lopez and Ballard provided Rodriguez Martinez the opportunity to interact with faculty with a variety of expertise&#8212;giving her the opportunity to develop interdisciplinary projects and enhance her future science and career potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Serving as a mentor has the potential to assist early career professionals to see what is possible,&#8221; Ballard says. &#8221;By serving as influential guides, we can help them find their place in astronomy and provide them with support so they can realize transformative work in the field.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballard earned her undergraduate degree in astrophysics at UC Berkeley in 2007, before attending Harvard University for her PhD. She was a NASA Carl Sagan Fellow at the University of Washington where she did postdoctoral work and was awarded a Women in Science Fellows postdoctoral fellowship by L'Or&#233;al USA to continue her research at MIT. She took part in the discovery of four exoplanets before she turned 30 years old, including Kepler-19c, the first exoplanet found using the transit-timing variation method on data from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kepler</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez was Ramirez-Ruiz&#8217;s first graduate student, completing her Ph.D. at UCSC in 2011. She was awarded the prestigious 2022 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Astronomical Society&#8217;s High Energy Astrophysics Division (HEAD) Early Career Prize, given for a significant advancement in high-energy astrophysics. She is also a recipient of the Annie Jump Cannon Award of the American Astronomical Society (2016).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez is grateful for the mentoring support she received at UCSC and credits the university and Ramirez-Ruiz for launching her career. She hopes the network will help transform the culture within academia and science.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My vision [for the future] is that all students will have the careers they dream of,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Those who want to be astronomers will have the careers they hoped for. I hope we can change the culture to be more supportive, more inclusive. I hope we can transform the culture and climate to enable better science.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>UCSC as a role model</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s astronomy program is one of the most diverse in the country&#8212;more than 30 percent of the department&#8217;s Ph.D. students are from historically marginalized communities. Ramirez-Ruiz stresses the important role the network can play in providing a formal structure of support for grad students, by providing access to role models who have similar lived experiences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nia Imara is an assistant professor of astronomy &amp; astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I'm grateful to be part of a network of such creative, innovative scientists who are also actively working to achieve equity in academia," Imara says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imara&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was appointed as a John Harvard Distinguished Science Fellow and Dean&#8217;s Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. She joined the Astronomy Department at UC Santa Cruz in 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her research involves understanding how stars are formed in vast regions occupying interstellar space called molecular clouds.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramirez-Ruiz says UC Santa Cruz should celebrate the work it has done to attract students of color. Now, he says, it&#8217;s time to create&#160; effective&#160; support structures for students and faculty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramirez-Ruiz credits the Heising-Simons Foundation for their vision and support.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Heising-Simons Foundation is thinking about how they catalyze the creation of such&#160; transformative support structures,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to give credit to the Heising-Simons Foundation for not just thinking about what&#8217;s out there and not just recreating what already exists, but really creating a structure that emanates from the needs of faculty and students&#160; of color,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The network will be coordinated out of UCSC&#8217;s Center for Reimagining Leadership. The center is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dedicated to establishing workplaces and learning environments that reflect our equity-forward values and allow the full human diversity of our nation and the world to meaningfully contribute to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://retirees.ucsc.edu/scholarships/brucelanescholarship/#:&#126;:text=The%20UCSC%20Retirees%20Association%20Bruce,weeks%20after%20high%20school%20graduation."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruce Lane Memorial Scholarship for military veteran students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;funded by the UCSC Retirees Association&#8212;was established in memory of Bruce Lane, who worked at UC Santa Cruz for 27 years as a project architect, educational facilities planner, and director of capital planning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lane served in Europe as a noncommissioned officer and commissioned engineer officer in the Army Reserves for 35 years. He was a recipient of the World War II GI Bill, and after working at UCSC for almost three decades, he became passionate about supporting UCSC military veteran students. The driving force behind the scholarship is Maxine Lane, who has carried on her husband&#8217;s wishes following his passing in 2008.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These people all volunteer. They risk losing their lives or becoming wounded or becoming affected psychologically,&#8221; Maxine said in a 2018 interview. &#8220;I know Bruce would be so happy about what we&#8217;re doing for the veterans.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC student and Bruce Lane Memorial Scholarship recipient Austin Kirby (Oakes &#8217;23, cognitive science) shares similar interests to Baker. A former Marine Corps administrative specialist, Kirby studies cognitive science and is fascinated by the brain&#8217;s possibilities. Kirby says the Bruce Lane Memorial Scholarship supports him financially during his time at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I would have had to have a part-time job without scholarships and grants,&#8221; Kirby says. &#8220;Without having that extra burden of working while going to school, I&#8217;ve been able to volunteer and gain experience in research labs, which is close to my hopeful future career. The scholarship has given me time, which I definitely appreciate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirby transferred to UCSC from South Puget Sound Community College in Olympia, WA, where he received his associates in pre-nursing. He says he is proud to be a Banana Slug.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love the campus, and I love the people,&#8221; Kirby said. It&#8217;s a unique place, and everybody&#8217;s okay with whoever you are. It&#8217;s a come-as-you-are type of place, and I really appreciate that. I think it&#8217;s a unique place to be and get a degree at. I love UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Angel Riotutar (Oakes &#8217;14, sociology) attended UC Santa Cruz, she engaged with the campus&#8217;s four ethnic resource centers, </span><a href="https://elcentro.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Centro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://aapirc.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAPIRC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://aarcc.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AARCC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the </span><a href="https://airc.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIRC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She was a self-described untraditional student who came to UCSC with an extensive background working with native organizations in programming, event planning, and providing resources. She served as a mentor for students and continues to do so as UCSC&#8217;s newly appointed Director of the </span><a href="https://airc.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Indian Resource Center (AIRC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riotutar started in the AIRC Director position in mid-July and said it&#8217;s been a wonderful experience to come full circle back to her alma mater.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What drew me back to this position was the opportunity to work in the ethnic Resource Center and work with Native students and be able to take it to a different level than what I was doing before,&#8221; Riotutar said. I was really excited about that and just being in an environment that&#8217;s comfortable, homey, and safe. Also, loving the interaction of the students and watching them excel in their academics is just amazing. It&#8217;s a win-win situation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AIRC&#8217;s objectives are to promote the value of a college education for American Indians, to serve as a supportive space for students, to center Indigenous knowledge and practices in activities and help preserve the culture and heritage of American Indian students, and to serve as a liaison between Native communities and the university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riotutar encourages students to visit the AIRC office, even if they are not looking for anything in particular.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I emphasize that the space is open to everyone regardless if they need resources or not,&#8221; she says. &#8220;If they just need a place to come and relax, to get away, or have some quiet time to just sit with themselves and study, the space is open to anyone who needs a space like that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AIRC supports the needs of American Indian students and increases Native visibility on campus by hosting student-centered programs and cultural events and providing tools for academic success and personal well-being.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center is a vital link between American Indian students, the University, and tribal communities that fosters growth through mentoring leadership opportunities, and scholarly development.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The environment is really conducive to support and community,&#8221; Riotutar says. &#8220;What I want to encourage when you&#8217;re in a college setting is being in community with other folks and being able to feel that this is where you&#8217;re meant to be.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to returning to UCSC in the AIRC Director role, Riotutar volunteered for various Native Organizations as a Board Chairperson, Board Member, and organizer of traditional ceremonies. She also volunteered with the Santa Cruz Indian Council, the Indian Health Center of Santa Clara Valley, the Costanoan Research Institute, and has supported various American Indian organizations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riotutar attended Cabrillo College, Gavilan College, earning her A.A. degree, and received her B.A. in Sociology from UCSC as a first-generation graduate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It has been absolutely amazing [at UC Santa Cruz],&#8221; Riotutar said. &#8220;When I think about coming back here full circle, it just reminds me that we&#8217;re all on a journey, and we don&#8217;t always know where our journey is going to take us, but it&#8217;s important to be able to embrace it, and then to realize that we are where we are meant to be. So I truly believe that I am where I am meant to be, and I&#8217;m excited.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="62884fa18072704618e4fea6022b1d51"><name>uaw-labor-strike</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Announced labor strike at UC campuses beginning Monday, Nov. 14</title><summary>The United Auto Workers has announced that it will be holding a systemwide labor strike at UC campuses beginning 8 a.m. on Monday, Nov. 14, until UCand the UAW resolve their differences at the bargaining table.&#13;

<p><span>Dear Campus Community,</span></p>
<p><span>The United Auto Workers&#8212;the union that represents University of California postdoctoral scholars, academic researchers, and graduate students employed as researchers, instructors, teaching assistants, tutors, and readers&#8212;has <span class="il">announced</span> that it will be holding a systemwide <span class="il">labor</span> <span class="il">strike</span> at <span class="il">UC</span> <span class="il">campuses</span> beginning 8 a.m. on Monday, Nov. 14, until <span class="il">UC</span>and the UAW resolve their differences at the bargaining table.</span></p>
<p><span>The <span class="il">strike</span> will include all four bargaining units: Postdoctoral Scholars, Academic Researchers, Academic Student Employees, and Graduate Student Researchers.</span></p>
<p><span>Up-to-date information will be published on the <span class="il">UC</span> Santa Cruz website at </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ucsc.edu/status&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668185101559000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1E_Fd3rXrdiF5rXZh95MRn" href="http://ucsc.edu/status" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ucsc.edu/status</span></a></span><span>. For questions, you may call your Employee &amp; <span class="il">Labor</span> Relations Analyst in Staff HR or email <a href="mailto:elrinfo@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">elrinfo@ucsc.edu</a>. Academic employees may reach out to <a href="mailto:apo@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">apo@ucsc.edu</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>In advance of potential demonstration activity, I write to share important and helpful information and resources.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Highlights</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>UC&#8217;s current proposal focuses on compensation, employment stability, and workload</li>
<li>UCSC supports protected free speech activities</li>
<li>Blocking access roads harms members of the campus community</li>
<li>Campus community should stay informed, remain flexible&#160;</li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong><span class="il">UC</span>&#8217;s current proposal focuses on compensation, employment stability, workload</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>These are systemwide contracts, and the <span class="il">UC</span> Office of the President has worked hard to try to reach agreements with the union&#8217;s leadership for all four bargaining units.&#160; <span class="il">UC</span>&#8217;s latest proposals, which reflect genuine responsiveness to union concerns related to compensation and benefits, show the university to be bargaining in good faith and working &#160;to address the most important issues raised during negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span>Academic Researchers, Postdoctoral Scholars, Graduate Student Researchers and Academic Student Employees are all valued members of the UCSC community and play important roles in supporting the University&#8217;s mission. We support the right of these employees to <span class="il">strike</span>, and the campus is also taking steps to sustain the continuity of its research and instructional operations in the event a <span class="il">strike</span> cannot be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span>You can learn </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://universityofcalifornia.edu/UAW%23offers&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668185101559000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3j6k57COdrlSn3LaCHz5qj" href="https://universityofcalifornia.edu/UAW#offers" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more online about the proposals <span class="il">UC</span> has passed</span></a>&#160;</span><span>at each of these bargaining tables.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>UCSC supports protected free speech activities</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><span class="il">UC</span> Santa Cruz is committed to ensuring that all people may exercise their constitutionally protected rights of free expression, speech, and assembly. The ongoing opportunity for the expression of a variety of viewpoints is at the core of this commitment. The right of free speech in a university includes the right to acts of peaceful dissent, protests in peaceable assembly, and orderly, nondisruptive demonstrations which include picketing.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Our campus </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://freespeech.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668185101559000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ev0yyoer83nItyElwB4wV" href="https://freespeech.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Free Speech website</span></a>&#160;</span><span>provides additional information.</span></p>
<p><span>No employee is ever obligated to engage in collective <span class="il">labor</span> activities, such as striking, picketing, or protesting. Unions are legally prohibited from threatening or coercing members in other ways to keep them from coming to work. Academic and staff employees should remain in contact with their supervisors, managers, and chairs to discuss their schedules and work locations when warranted.</span></p>
<p><span>If you feel you are being threatened, harassed, intimidated about crossing the picket line, or are prevented from working by picketers or striking employees, please immediately notify your supervisor and your campus employee and <span class="il">labor</span> relations office. In cases of emergency, please dial 9-1-1.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Blocking access roads harms members of the campus community</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Preventing vehicles or individuals from entering or leaving campus imposes burdens on those who already must overcome obstacles in their day. Students, staff, and faculty with mobility challenges face additional difficulty getting to the academic core because buses are unable to cross onto campus. Parents face uncertainty or delays taking their children to school or childcare. Students, staff, faculty and their families living on campus experience stress about getting to off-campus jobs or appointments on time.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Campus community should stay informed, remain flexible</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Though we do not know precisely how these <span class="il">strike</span> activities will impact the operation of the residential campus, we are working to do everything we can to ensure continued operations. Campus Transit shuttles will be operational. However, potential <span class="il">strike</span>-related disruptions at the main and/or west campus entrances may result in transportation delays, including an inability of METRO buses to access campus. In that situation, we anticipate that METRO campus routes will instead stop at the Barn Theater, and riders can board a Campus Transit shuttle nearby.</span></p>
<p><span>TAPS Transit Operations will give highest priority to providing Disability Van Service (DVS) clients transport between on-campus locations while suspending the Bike Shuttle, Westside Connector, and modifying regular Loop and Upper Campus services as needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Dining Services will prioritize food service at the dining hall at College Nine and John R. Lewis College and open additional dining halls based on staffing levels. Dining hall hours will be limited from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and the types of prepared food available may be limited as well. We also anticipate that all cafes and restaurants operated by <span class="il">UC</span> Santa Cruz Dining may be closed.</span></p>
<p><span>We anticipate that Student Health Services will be open during the <span class="il">strike</span>, but services may be limited. CAPS services will be available, but may be offered remotely.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Los Trabajadores de Autos Unidos (UAW, por sus siglas en ingl&#233;s) &#8212; sindicato que representa a los estudiantes post doctorales, investigadores acad&#233;micos y estudiantes de post grado de la Universidad de California empleados como investigadores, instructores, auxiliares docentes, tutores, y conferencistas &#8212;anunci&#243; que iniciar&#225; una huelga laboral a nivel de todo el sistema en los campus de la UC a partir de las 8 a.m. del lunes, 14 de noviembre, hasta que la UC y la UAW resuelvan sus diferencias en la mesa de negociaciones.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Las actuales propuestas de la UC enfocan la compensaci&#243;n, la estabilidad de empleo y la carga de trabajo</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Estos contratos abarcan a todo el sistema, y la Oficina del Presidente de la UC ha hecho un esfuerzo tratando de alcanzar acuerdos con los dirigentes sindicales de las cuatro unidades negociadoras.&#160; Las m&#225;s recientes propuestas de la UC, que reflejan una sensibilidad genuina hacia los intereses sindicales en relaci&#243;n con la compensaci&#243;n y los beneficios, demuestran que la universidad est&#225; negociando de buena fe y trabajando en direcci&#243;n a los asuntos m&#225;s importantes que han surgido durante las negociaciones.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Los Investigadores Acad&#233;micos, Estudiantes Postdoctorales, Estudiantes de Postgrado Investigadores y Estudiantes Acad&#233;micos Empleados son todos miembros apreciados de la comunidad de la UCSC y desempe&#241;an papeles importantes en apoyo de la misi&#243;n de la Universidad. &#160;Apoyamos el derecho de estos empleados a la huelga, y el campus tambi&#233;n est&#225; tomando medidas para mantener la continuidad de sus operaciones docentes e investigativas en caso de que no se pueda evitar una huelga.&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ud. podr&#225; saber <a href="https://universityofcalifornia.edu/UAW#offers">m&#225;s en l&#237;nea acerca de las propuestas que la UC ha presentado en cada una de estas mesas de negociaci&#243;n</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>La UCSC apoya las actividades de libre expresi&#243;n protegidas</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">La UC Santa Cruz tiene el compromiso de asegurar que todas las personas puedan ejercer sus derechos constitucionalmente protegidos de libertad de expresi&#243;n, palabra y asamblea. La oportunidad en curso de expresar una variedad de puntos de vista radica en el mismo centro ese compromiso. El derecho a la libertad de expresi&#243;n en una universidad incluye el derecho a disentir pac&#237;ficamente, a protestar en asambleas pac&#237;ficas, y a manifestaciones ordenadas y no disruptivas, las cuales incluyen piquetes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">El <a href="https://freespeech.ucsc.edu/">sitio web de Libertad de Expresi&#243;n</a> <span>de nuestro campus proporciona informaci&#243;n adicional.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ning&#250;n empleado jam&#225;s estar&#225; obligado a involucrarse en actividades laborales colectivas, tales como irse a una huelga, piquetear, o protestar. A los sindicatos les est&#225; legalmente prohibido el amenazar o coaccionar a los miembros por otros medios para que no vayan a trabajar. Los empleados acad&#233;micos y del personal deber&#225;n mantenerse en contacto con sus supervisores, administradores y directores para conversar sobre sus horarios y sitios de trabajo cuando sea necesario.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Si Ud. se sintiera amenazado, hostigado o intimidado respecto a cruzar la l&#237;nea de piquetes, u otros empleados en huelga o en los piquetes le impidieran llegar a su trabajo, por favor notif&#237;quelo inmediatamente a su supervisor y a la oficina de relaciones laborales del empleado de su campus. En casos de emergencia, por favor llame al 9-1-1.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bloquear las v&#237;as de acceso perjudica a los miembros de la comunidad del campus</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Impedir que veh&#237;culos o individuos entre o salgan del campus entorpece a aquellos que ya de por s&#237; tienen que superar obst&#225;culos durante el transcurso del d&#237;a. Estudiantes, personal y miembros de la facultad con limitaciones de movilidad encaran una dificultad adicional para llegar al centro acad&#233;mico porque los autobuses no podr&#225;n cruzar al campus. Para los padres que llevan sus hijos a la escuela o guarder&#237;a infantil esta situaci&#243;n plantea incertidumbre y/o demoras. Los estudiantes, el personal, la facultad y sus familiares que vivan en el campus enfrentar&#225;n el estr&#233;s de llegar a tiempo a sus empleos o citas en el campus.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>La comunidad del campus deber&#225; mantenerse informada y permanecer flexible</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Aunque no sabemos precisamente c&#243;mo estas actividades de huelga impactar&#225;n a las operaciones residenciales del campus, estamos trabajando para hacer cuanto podamos a fin de asegurar la continuidad operativa. Los medios de transporte internos para el Tr&#225;nsito del Campus seguir&#225;n operando. Sin embargo, las disrupciones potenciales debidas a la huelga en las entradas de campus central y/o el del oeste pudieran causar demoras en el transporte, incluso la incapacidad de los autobuses del METRO para acceder al campus. Ante semejante situaci&#243;n, prevemos que las rutas del METRO al campus har&#225;n sus paradas en el Barn Theater, y los pasajeros podr&#225;n abordar un bus del Tr&#225;nsito del Campus cerca de all&#237;.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Operaciones de Tr&#225;nsito (TAPS, por sus siglas en ingl&#233;s) le dar&#225; su mayor prioridad a proporcionar Servicios de Camionetas para Discapacitados (DVS, por sus siglas en ingl&#233;s) a los clientes que necesiten transportarse a sitios dentro del campus mientras se suspendan el Bike Shuttle, el Westside Connector, y se modifiquen los servicios regulares del Loop y Upper Campus a medida que sea necesario.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Los Servicios de Comidas dar&#225;n prioridad al servicio de alimentos en los comedores de College Nine y John R. Lewis College y se abrir&#225;n comedores adicionales basados en los niveles del personal disponible. El horario de los comedores estar&#225; limitado de las 7 a.m. a las 8 p.m. y los tipos de comidas preparadas tambi&#233;n pudieran limitarse. Tambi&#233;n prevemos que todos los caf&#233;s y restaurantes operados por UC Santa Cruz Dining pudieran quedar cerrados.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Se prev&#233; que los Servicios de Salud Estudiantil (SHS, por sus siglas en ingl&#233;s) seguir&#225;n abiertos durante la huelga, pero algunos servicios pudieran estar limitados. Los servicios CAPS estar&#225;n disponibles, pero pudieran ofrecerse de forma remota. Para servicios m&#233;dicos, contacte nuestra L&#237;nea de Consejos de Enfermer&#237;a en el 831-459-2591.

<p>All-In, which was held from Oct. 26-28, 2022, at multiple locations around Santa Cruz, included five plenary sessions, 87 presentations across 42 breakout sessions, a poster session, numerous spoken word performances, including by <a href="https://www.says.ucdavis.edu/about">Sacramento Area Youth Speaks (SAYS)</a>, Monterey County Poet Laureate <a href="http://www.danielsummerhill.com/">Daniel Summerhill</a>, and <a href="https://www.fongtran.com/">Fong Tran</a>, and a screening of the award-winning film <a href="https://www.fruitsoflaborfilm.com/">&#8220;Fruits of Labor.&#8221;</a> There was also a reception at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History (MAH) with cultural performances by <a href="https://scsenderos.org/">Senderos Centeotl Danza y Baile</a> folkloric dance group.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;This was not your traditional academic conference,&#8221; said Chris Benner, professor of environmental studies and sociology and faculty director for IST. &#8220;Right now, we face a crisis of racial and economic inequality, climate change, democracy, and undermining faith in political solutions; this requires all of us to collaborate. Sharing strategies to expand and deepen the co-production of knowledge will help us tackle these pressing social issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>All-In centered on the idea of critical community-engaged scholarship, an action-oriented, equitable collaboration towards achieving structural change and social justice. The goal is to build stronger relationships between universities and the communities they serve by addressing issues of power and equity and deeply engaging undergraduate students.</p>
<p>According to Benner, All-In demonstrated that the university is well-positioned to be a leader and convener for like-minded higher education institutions across California interested in community-engaged scholarship. Grassroots organizations like the <a href="https://www.acceinstitute.org/">ACCE Institute</a> say they can see the value.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to ask people from the universities to come out of the university and into the community first to listen, and then to help us really understand what they [the universities] are missing,&#8221;&#160; said Christina Livingston, ACCE&#8217;s executive director during the All-In closing plenary session. &#8220;There is real wisdom and knowledge that the community members hold, but we don&#8217;t know everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conference also marked the debut of the new <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/work/campus-community/">Campus + Community initiative</a>, led by Rebecca London, associate professor of sociology.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We now have a web of engaged scholarship that reaches across disciplines, throughout our campus, and into our various communities,&#8221; London said during the opening plenary session.&#160;</p>
<p>According to many who attended, the conference inspired participants with the range of ideas and examples for effective university-community partnerships and energized by the possibilities of co-creating systemic change for justice.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>All-In was initially scheduled to be held in March 2020 but was canceled abruptly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The organizers wanted to keep the conversation going in the interim, so they hosted a <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/all-in-events/">series of virtual events in 2021</a> to encourage conversation and collaboration. But this year&#8217;s event was the first opportunity for All-In to meet in person.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span>&#8220;Colleges and universities seem to have discovered community engagement and the importance of raising their visibility off campus, rolling out new programs like service learning, and touting scholarship opportunities that serve the public good,&#8221; said Steve McKay, associate professor of sociology and director of the <a href="https://labor.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Center for Labor Studies</a>, who presented at the conference. &#8220;But such loose definitions of the &#8216;public good&#8217; can sometimes lead to a kind of shallowness that may sound nice and does not cost much, but also does not strike at the heart of inequality or injustice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many at the All-In conference aspired to do even more.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to push this budding movement beyond &#8216;performative engagement&#8217; - that is beyond slogans and colorful banners with &#8216;diverse&#8217; faces and community handshakes,&#8221; said McKay. &#8220;Critical community engagement means not settling for &#8216;public good,&#8217; but working for the &#8216;public better.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h2>What is happening?</h2>
<p>The University of California is currently in contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers (UAW) regarding four separate academic bargaining units: Postdoctoral Scholars, Academic Researchers, Academic Student Employees (teaching assistants/readers/tutors), and Graduate Student Researchers.</p>
<p>UC&#8217;s primary goal in these negotiations is multiyear agreements that recognize these employees&#8217; important and highly valued contributions to UC&#8217;s teaching and research mission with fair pay, quality health and family-friendly benefits, and a supportive and respectful work environment.</p>
<p>UC believes its offers are generous, responsive to union priorities, and recognize the many valuable contributions of these employees. UC&#8217;s proposals include pay increases, expanded paid leaves, increased family support and child care benefits for postdoctoral scholars, ASEs, and GSRs, and full coverage of all campus fees for eligible ASEs and GSRs. This is in addition to full UC coverage for tuition, healthcare, and student services for eligible ASEs and GSRs.</p>
<p>Throughout negotiations, UC has listened carefully to UAW priorities with an open mind and a genuine willingness to compromise. Negotiations are progressing, and many tentative agreements have been reached on key issues such as a respectful work environment and health and safety matters. UC is committed to continuing to negotiate in good faith and reaching full agreements as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>How is UC Santa Cruz responding to the strike?</h2>
<p>Working closely with the University of California Office of the President, we are seeking to ensure the continuity of learning and research and keep our campus community informed and updated about the strike.</p>
<p>These are systemwide contracts, and the UC Office of the President has worked hard to try to reach agreements with the union&#8217;s leadership for all four bargaining units. UC&#8217;s latest proposals, which reflect genuine responsiveness to union concerns related to compensation and benefits, show the university to be bargaining in good faith and working to address the most important issues raised during negotiations.<br/><br/>Academic Researchers, Postdoctoral Scholars, Graduate Student Researchers and Academic Student Employees are all valued members of the UCSC community and play important roles in supporting the University&#8217;s mission. We support the right of these employees to strike, and the campus is also taking steps to sustain the continuity of its research and instructional operations in the event a strike cannot be avoided.&#160;The Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning is providing a <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/resources/labor-actions/">range of support and information for instructors</a>.<br/><br/>You can learn more online about the <a href="https://universityofcalifornia.edu/UAW#offers">proposals UC has passed</a> at each of these bargaining tables.</p>
<h2>What is the University of California&#8217;s response to the UAW&#8217;s allegations of unlawful behavior?</h2>
<p>The UAW alleges that the University of California has engaged in unlawful behavior, which is not true. Throughout the negotiations, UC has listened carefully to the union&#8217;s concerns and bargained in good faith, as illustrated by the many tentative agreements reached thus far including on topics underlying the UAW&#8217;s allegations. Despite these unfounded claims, UC remains committed to continuing its good faith efforts to reach agreements with UAW as quickly as possible.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="769bb77f807270467b86176519836f18"><name>student-labor-strike-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Stay informed about the announced labor strike</title><summary>This message provides students with information about what to expect on campus during the potential strike, what resources are available to support students, and how students might prepare for the potential impacts of the strike.&#13;

We do, however, encourage you to plan for possible delays. Potential strike-related disruptions at the main and/or west campus entrances may result in transportation delays, including the inability of METRO buses to access campus. In that situation, we anticipate that METRO campus routes will instead stop at the Barn Theater, and riders can board a Campus Transit shuttle nearby. The campus will post directional signage to help guide those METRO passengers to a Campus Transit shuttle.&#160; </span><br/><span>&#160; </span><br/><span>TAPS Transit Operations will give highest priority to providing Disability Van Service (DVS) clients transport between on-campus locations while suspending the Bike Shuttle, Westside Connector, and modifying regular Loop and Upper Campus services as needed. </span><br/><span>&#160; </span>

<p>The study, accepted for publication in <em>Environmental Pollution</em> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749122017626">available online</a>, included testing microplastic particles recovered from the murres for estrogenic activity, which indicates the potential for hormone disrupting effects. The researchers found that all the murres examined had microparticles in their digestive tracts, and almost a quarter (23%) had particles that exhibited estrogenic activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;These tiny plastic particles are leaching substances that have the potential for hormonal disruption that can have cascading effects on reproductive and immune functions,&#8221; said senior author Myra Finkelstein, adjunct professor of environmental toxicology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The study, led by UCSC graduate student Sami Michishita, sought to quantify the prevalence and composition of microparticles in Monterey Bay. The researchers found that 58% of anchovies and 100% of murres had microparticles (particles smaller than 5 millimeters) in their digestive tracts. Most of the particles (78%) were fibers, and more than half of the particles (57%) were identified as plastic using an optical technique called Raman spectroscopy.</p>
<p>The Raman spectroscopy was done in collaboration with Jenessa Gjeltema at UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, and testing for estrogenic activity was done in collaboration with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re looking at tiny fibers under the microscope, you can&#8217;t always tell if it&#8217;s cotton or polyester, so we took that next step to determine what it was, and then took the further step of testing them for estrogenic activity,&#8221; Finkelstein said.</p>
<p>Seawater samples obtained from two intake systems&#8212;one in Santa Cruz and one in Moss Landing&#8212;contained about 2 microparticles per 1,000 liters. Anchovies would most likely accumulate the particles in their digestive systems because they feed by filtering tiny plankton from the seawater. As a significant component of the murres&#8217; diets, the anchovies are probably a major source of the microplastics in the murres&#8217; digestive systems.</p>
<p>Finkelstein has been studying the impact of plastic pollution on seabirds for years. Many seabirds consume relatively large pieces of plastic (&#8220;macroplastics&#8221;), mistaking it for food.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the main problems with macroplastics is that they&#8217;re taking the place of food. With microplastics, a major concern is the toxic compounds that may be leaching out of it,&#8221; Finkelstein said.</p>
<p>Many of the chemicals associated with plastics are known as endocrine disrupting compounds because they can mimic hormones such as estrogen by binding to the hormone receptors in the body and disrupting physiological functions. In this study, the researchers did not try to determine how the murres or anchovies might be affected by the microplastics. That&#8217;s a harder question to study and one that Finkelstein&#8217;s lab is currently working to answer in collaboration with San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next step is to see how this may be affecting the birds,&#8221; she said. &#8220;With microplastics, it seems we are finding them anywhere we look. But we need to do more work to find out what the biological impact is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher Tubbs, associate director of reproductive sciences at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, said, &#8220;We know plastic debris, both large and small, in our oceans and waterways is an issue. This partnership between UCSC and San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance gives us the chance to dig into the reproductive consequences for seabirds when they consume microplastics. We believe this is the first time this type of estrogen-based assessment is being conducted for this type of widespread marine pollution.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Michishita, Finkelstein, and Tubbs, the coauthors of the paper include Corinne Gibble at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife; Rachel Felton at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance; and Jenessa Gjeltema and Jackelyn Lang at UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.

Since 1976, the ARCS Foundation's Northern California Chapter has given nearly $3 million in scholarships to UCSC students.</p>
<p>The ARCS Foundation, founded in 1958, is a national organization that provides scholarships and fellowships for the country's most promising science, medical, and engineering students. This year's ARCS scholars at UC Santa Cruz represent the Science Communication Program and the Departments of Astronomy and Astrophysics; Biomolecular Engineering; Chemistry and Biochemistry; Computer Science and Engineering; Earth and Planetary Sciences; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Environmental Studies; Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology; Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology; Ocean Sciences; and Physics. The scholars and their interests are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Reilly Raab, Computer Science and Engineering: </strong>Raab is interested in socially responsible applications of machine learning. He is currently exploring the dynamics of prejudiced social norms in a multiagent setting as well as the long-term effects of fairness interventions using reinforcement learning. His research frames the dynamics of social disparities and sustainability as control problems in multiagent systems, combining theoretical results in evolutionary game theory, empirical approaches to multiagent reinforcement learning, and the concerns of fairness and accountability in machine learning.</p>
<p><strong>Rae Taylor-Burns, Ocean Sciences: </strong>Taylor-Burns&#8217; general research interests include climate adaptation, hydrodynamic modeling, coastal science and policy, physical oceanography, and coastal engineering. She is studying the influence of marshes on wave transformation in a sheltered estuary; the impacts of stakeholder identified marsh restoration on flooding in San Mateo County; and the interactions between marsh habitat and levee failure in San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Philpott, Chemistry and Biochemistry:</strong> Philpott&#8217;s research focuses on the molecular details of mammalian circadian rhythms, using structural biology to draw connections between structure and function in the molecular circadian clock, which ultimately controls our physiology and behavior. His research uses biophysical methods such as X-ray crystallography and NMR to interrogate the interactions between core clock components that give rise to 24-hour rhythms.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Trebino, Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology</strong>: Trebino&#8217;s research project focuses on understanding the mechanism and regulation of biofilm formation in the human pathogen <em>Vibrio cholerae,</em> which causes cholera. Biofilm formation is important component of <em>V. cholerae&#8217;s </em>infection cycle, and it is controlled by integrated regulatory networks that allow this pathogen to sense and respond to changing environmental conditions. This research will provide novel insights into <em>V. cholerae</em> biofilm formation during infection and transmission.</p>
<p><strong>Kateryne Voitiuk, Biomolecular Engineering and Bioinformatics:</strong> Curious about how the brain processes information, Voitiuk is interested in neural interfaces, closed-loop neuroscience, and biologically inspired machine learning algorithms. Her research project involves studying neural activity in 3D stem-cell-derived organoid and connectoid models of brain regions and activity changes with closed-loop stimulus-response training. The experimental setup integrates high-density multi-electrode array recordings with electrical and optogenetic light stimuli.</p>
<p><strong>Will Chapman, Earth and Planetary Sciences:</strong> Chapman specializes in understanding processes of erosion and sediment transport in rivers. His research focuses on how rivers both respond to and reflect changes in land use and climate, combining careful fieldwork, analysis of high-resolution topographic data, and big data analysis. Currently, he is exploring a fundamental problem in fluvial geomorphology: How do non-perennial rivers in arid settings move the same amount of sediment as perennial rivers in temperate settings, despite having far less water?</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Tyler DeWitt, Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology:</strong> Tyler DeWitt&#8217;s research is focused on discovery of the molecular mechanisms that control cell growth and size, with the goal of understanding why nearly all cancer cells have severe defects in control of cell size. His work aims to better understand growth-dependent signaling in the context of the cell cycle and cell size control, using budding yeast as an initial model for investigation and then testing for conservation in mammalian systems.</p>
<p><strong>Mays Mohammed Salih, Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology:</strong> Salih studies immune response regulation with a focus on regulation through RNA and splicing. Her thesis focuses on how RNA splicing proteins can regulate the immune response and alter the transcriptional and translational profile of a cell after an infection. Studying mechanisms of immune regulation will help better understand how organisms respond to pathogens, mechanisms by which inflammatory and autoimmune diseases arise, and ways to target them via therapeutics.</p>
<p><strong>Nolan Smyth, Physics:</strong> Smyth works at the intersection of dark matter, black holes, astro-particle physics, and machine learning. His research projects include exploring the impact of a period of dark matter kinetic recoupling on small scale structure; determining whether a dark QED model can produce black holes in the pair-instability mass gap; parameter estimation and potential detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background from a machine learning approach to time-series data; and determining whether a cosmic axion background is detectable from resonance of higher modes at ADMX.</p>
<p><strong>Rosa Wallace Everson, Astronomy and Astrophysics:</strong> Everson is active in one of the most challenging and novel areas of modern astrophysical research: the evolution of binary stellar systems, including black holes and neutron stars. With the advent of gravitational wave astronomy, understanding the fate of interacting binary stars has become paramount. Supported by insights from local and global computational simulations of binaries undergoing common envelope evolution, Everson&#8217;s work is updating a decades-old analytical framework for predicting the outcomes of these systems.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Murphy, Astronomy and Astrophysics:</strong> Murphy is interested in what the population of precisely characterized &#8220;exoplanets&#8221; (planets orbiting stars other than the sun) can tell us about the physical processes that govern planet formation and evolution in our galaxy. He is a member of the TESS-Keck Survey (TKS), a large, multi-institution Doppler survey of promising planet candidates discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. His work with TKS includes observing with the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck I telescope as well as the characterization of small planets amenable to future atmospheric observations.</p>
<p><strong>Francis Joyce, Environmental Studies:</strong> A restoration and community ecologist, Joyce studies ecological processes affecting recovery in tropical forests to inform restoration and conservation strategies. His dissertation focuses on factors limiting the recruitment of late-successional tree species in former agricultural land in southern Costa Rica that was restored almost two decades ago using different methods. He is also analyzing long-term monitoring data to understand how bird communities change in restored forests over time.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Kustra, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology:</strong> Kustra&#8217;s research focuses on cryptic female choice&#8212;a process in which females bias fertilization to favor specific males. He uses empirical work on the ocellated wrasse <em>(Symphodus ocellatus) </em>to understand how females can influence the evolution of male behavior and individual-based models to understand how cryptic female choice can cause speciation (the creation of new species).</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Adamczek, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology:</strong> Adamczek&#8217;s research focuses on the intersection between health, behavior, and fitness using marine mammals as a model system. Her dissertation work explores the fitness impacts of growth and investment into large body size and how these factors influence reproductive success and resilience to anthropogenic and environmental disturbance.</p>
<p><strong>Anna Marie Yanny, Science Communication:</strong> Yanny earned a B.S. in behavioral neuroscience at Western Washington University in 2018 and spent four years conducting research on genetic cell types at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. Her research comparing cell types in the human brain to those of other mammals was published in the journal <em>Nature</em>. Her science communication pieces have been featured in the <em>Seattle Times</em> and the Allen Institute news.</p>

<p>Known for her extensive knowledge of emerging diseases and public health, Garrett said she has become &#8220;deeply angry and disappointed with what has happened with COVID, not just in our nation but worldwide.&#8221; She went on to describe numerous missed opportunities to better control the pandemic and limit its impact, which, she said, &#8220;I fear will be missed again with the next microbe and the next&#8212;and believe me, there will be a next, and a next, and a next.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garrett&#8217;s books include <em>The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World out of Balance</em> (1994), <em>Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health</em> (2000), and <em>I Heard the Sirens Scream: How Americans Responded to the 9/11 and Anthrax Attacks</em> (2011). She has received the Pulitzer Prize, Peabody Award, and Polk Award (twice) for her work.</p>
<p>Chancellor Cynthia Larive introduced Garrett, noting that &#8220;her work reflects our deep campuswide commitment to social justice, to science, truth, and community engagement, and her association with UC Santa Cruz is a source of pride for me and for our campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event was sponsored by UCSC&#8217;s Global and Community Health Program. With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to disrupt people&#8217;s lives and the global economy, the need for strong local, national, and global public health programs has never been more apparent.</p>
<p>In her remarks, Garrett emphasized the devastating economic toll of the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re now calling this the $16 trillion virus,&#8221; she said, referring to an estimate of the total cost of the pandemic by economists David Cutler and Lawrence Summers, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771764">published in the medical journal <em>JAMA</em></a> in 2020.</p>
<p>Could this have been avoided? Garrett described two possible scenarios for responding to COVID that she presented in April 2020 to the leaders of United Nations agencies. In the first scenario, she said, &#8220;the rich world takes care of itself,&#8221; and vaccines get rolled out first in the wealthy nations (which is essentially what happened). Uncontrolled circulation of the virus in unvaccinated populations would allow it to evolve, and newly emerging strains would cycle back and forth between the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere. The result, she told them, would be &#8220;a permanent burden on the U.N. system, just like with HIV.&#8221;</p>
<p>The alternative scenario, Garrett said, would require effective disease surveillance and vaccination on a global scale. She outlined the technologies and policies needed to achieve this, including point-of-care diagnostic tools; universal, transparent access to information and data on infections and vaccination rates; a vaccine that is effective at blocking transmission and affordably priced; funding to establish the infrastructure for vaccine distribution; identification of animal carriers of the virus and closing of live animal markets; environmental surveillance to detect the virus; and effective communications to combat misinformation.</p>
<p>This second scenario of a global response to control the virus would also require China and the United States to collaborate, and the U.N. leadership told her that was not likely to happen, Garrett said. The problem, she said, is that &#8220;we are lacking any global governance that can protect human health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garrett ended her prepared remarks by repeating her call for a system of environmental surveillance to detect emerging diseases. &#8220;We need a permanent and long-term way of knowing what is going on in our environment,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Garrett was then joined onstage by two of the core faculty in global and community health, Assistant Professor of Sociology Alicia Riley and Assistant Professor of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology Valerie Cortez.</p>
<p>Riley, noting that Garrett has been &#8220;making these calls for an early warning system for detecting emerging infection threats since her first book,&#8221; asked how her views have evolved as she has lived through the emergence of new diseases. In her response, Garrett sounded discouraged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where we are now, the CDC has lost its reputation, and our own credibility as a voice of how to fight disease has been undermined by the U.S. having the highest death burden in the world, and we seem incapable of acting in any kind of solidarity as a nation to combat COVID,&#8221; she said. &#8220;At this point, when I say we need to be out there funding surveillance, I feel like there&#8217;s less listening today than 20 years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cortez asked Garrett to address &#8220;what we as educators can do&#8221; to prepare students to address these issues so that our public health systems can be better prepared to handle future emerging diseases. Garrett noted that &#8220;the financial incentives are all in the wrong place,&#8221; and funding for public health is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The interest is there among the kids&#8212;they want to be out there doing something meaningful, and global health is attractive to them,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The problem is who&#8217;s going to finance them. Schools of public health have to teach kids politics 101&#8212;how to put a bill before your city council. They have to become skilled at making the argument for sustained funding that will make it possible for them to achieve their goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riley said that actually fits well with the goals of UCSC&#8217;s interdisciplinary Global and Community Health Program, which aims to give students a broad set of knowledge and skills by bringing together faculty in a range of disciplines, from the social sciences to biomedicine.</p>
<p>As Chancellor Larive said in her introductory remarks, &#8220;Our goal is to educate a new generation of health leaders and health workers with expertise drawn from a wide array of disciplines, and with the ability to communicate and learn from one another across a diversity of perspectives. Through this interdisciplinary education, we hope to contribute to the health of all communities, global and local, in which our students will work in the future.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="77db773a807270467b861765aafbba56"><name>josephson-mud-batteries</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Engineer deploys research on 'mud batteries' for powering sustainable agriculture </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Colleen Josephson published new research on the current state and future potential of microbial fuel cells for powering sustainable agriculture systems. </summary><start-date>1668445200000</start-date><path>/2022/11/josephson-mud-batteries</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/11/josephson-mud-batteries</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1668458182434</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1669161177218</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/11/images/colleen_300.png</path><link>site://news/2022/11/images/colleen_300.png</link><site>news</site><name>colleen_300.png</name><display-name>colleen_300.png</display-name><file-size>254480</file-size><width>300</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>Colleen Josephson holds a microbial fuel cell in front of a plowed row of dirt.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/11/images/colleen_80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/11/images/colleen_80.png</link><site>news</site><name>colleen_80.png</name><display-name>colleen_80.png</display-name><file-size>18438</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Colleen Josephson holds a microbial fuel cell in front of a plowed row of dirt.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Colleen Josephson has deployed research on "mud batteries" at the UCSC farm.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The UCSC farm hosts one of the first field research sites for studying the potential of microbial fuel cells 
</article-subhead><article-text>With growing populations, climate change, and high levels of consumption, many areas of the world can expect to face water shortages by 2050. The majority of freshwater on earth is used for agriculture, driving the need for soil moisture sensing systems that are proven to help farmers more efficiently water their crops. While this tool has the potential to minimize or avoid a water crisis, it is not widely used due to cost and difficult maintenance.&#160;<br/><br/>Microbial fuel cells, a method for gathering tiny amounts of energy from bacteria that live in soil, are a potential solution to provide renewable energy to power soil moisture detection systems on farms. UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Colleen Josephson <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3568113.3568117">published new research</a> exploring the current state of this technology and future opportunities for expanding its efficacy and impact.<br/><br/>The farm at UCSC currently hosts one of the only sites in the world to test this technology in the field, as Josephson&#8217;s group and her collaborators experiment with the efficacy of microbial fuel cells, also called mud batteries, outside of a laboratory.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;To our knowledge, we&#8217;re the first to be looking at how we can use these microbial fuel cells in outdoor sensor networks,&#8221; Jospehson said. &#8220;Some of our early results have been pretty exciting, showing that we can incubate these cells in a laboratory environment and then move them out to a farm field and generate power in a relatively steady state.&#8221;<br/><br/>Past research has shown that monitoring the levels of water in a crop field can help farmers better water their crops, maintaining yields while using 20 to 50 percent less water. But today, fewer than 10 percent of farms in the U.S. use intelligent watering systems. Josephson and her coauthors on the new research (Weitao Shuai and George Wells at Northwestern University, Pat Pannuto and Gabriel Marcano and UC San Diego, and Josiah Hester at the Georgia Institute of Technology) believe this technology can be leveraged for the resilience of food-producing ecosystems, allowing us to farm and feed ourselves as sustainability as possible while minimizing impact on the planet.<br/><br/><strong>An emerging technology</strong><br/><br/>While employed at Microsoft Research before joining Baskin Engineering, Josephson worked on a project to develop lower-cost sensing solutions for agriculture, an area that combined her expertise in low-power wireless communication systems and her personal interests in biology, gardening, and food systems.&#160;<br/><br/>After a few years of research, her team came up with <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3460112.3472326">technology that could monitor soil moisture</a> at a fraction of the cost of other systems and was significantly easier for farmers to deploy and maintain. The system was designed to last five-years on a single coin-cell battery, but the researchers wanted to push for a renewable system where the users would never have to worry about their power source.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;We had been looking at how we can overcome the challenges of supplying power to the farm field, and we found out about some work that had been going on about harvesting energy from naturally occurring microbes in the soil,&#8221; Josephson said. &#8220;That seemed like a really exciting thing to pair with this low-cost soil moisture sensing work.&#8221;<br/><br/>Microbial fuel cells work by harvesting energy from specific soil bacteria called exoelectrogens. As these bacteria eat nutrients, they essentially &#8220;breathe out&#8221; solid state electron acceptors, which can be routed to a circuit and used to produce power. The microbial fuel cell itself operates at a very low voltage, so the scientists use a power harvesting chip to condition the electricity to be at a voltage compatible with the electronics system.&#160;

<br/><br/>But the researchers have found that today&#8217;s power harvesting chips that are optimized for other energy sources such as solar or kinetic don&#8217;t do a good job of harvesting energy from mud batteries. The algorithms baked into these state-of-the-art chips end up negatively affecting the bacteria, making them produce power at far below their peak. To their surprise, the researchers found a simple, static resistor does a better job of harvesting energy than existing smart algorithms for other applications.&#160;<br/><br/>Josephson is planning future research around how to redesign the power harvesting chips to more effectively use microbial power sources.&#160;<br/><br/>Microbial fuel cells are not a new invention and have been an area of interest for researchers such as civil engineers looking to harvest energy from wastewater. But harvesting energy from the soil is a less common area of research, and one that traditionally has not been an area of focus for electrical engineers, likely because until recently, electronics were not low-power enough to effectively leverage the tiny amounts of power these fuel cells produce.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;This is not a replacement for your wall jack &#8211; this is a special power source designed for really rugged environments, where we can put long-lived sensor systems in places we've never been able to have them before.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Future opportunities</strong><br/><br/>The health of microbes is extremely important for the overall health of the soil, just like the health of the microbes in our guts is key to a healthy digestive system. In addition to powering soil moisture sensing, monitoring the power output of the soil microbes could give clues to the well-being of the environment.<br/><br/>&#8220;It's not perfect, but at the very least it could be a very interesting way to do early detection,&#8221; Josephson said. &#8220;If these electrogenic bacteria are dying, maybe all the other bacteria are unhappy, too, and then you could go and do some additional testing.&#8221;<br/><br/>It is currently difficult to do real-time, in-ground monitoring of some of the factors that play into microbe health, such as the nitrogen levels in the soil. But because power that&#8217;s produced fluctuates based on temperature, soil moisture, and the nutrients in the soil, Josephson thinks that analyzing&#160; traditional metrics like soil moisture, temperature and electrical conductivity along with the novel metric of power output of the microbial system could be a way to keep an eye on overall microbial health &#8211; a concept called &#8220;sensor fusion.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;If you know how the microbes normally behave given temperature, time of year, and irrigation level, and you see that the power output is anomalous given the current system conditions, then you can infer that some property we can&#8217;t yet effectively monitor might be the culprit.&#8221;<br/><br/>While the mud batteries are currently being tested on the farm at UCSC as well as at Stanford University, Josephson is <a href="https://patpannuto.com/pubs/madden2022smfcCurrentSense.pdf">looking to deploy them</a> on farms around the country to see how the fuel cells behave in other climates, under pressures such as different soil makeup or the freezing temperatures of the Midwest and New England. In addition to furthering the batteries themselves, this would benefit the development of sensor fusion in that having more data from a diversity of climates could help the researchers better understand what conditions keep the bacteria healthy.<br/><br/>Beyond agriculture, Josephson says that she and her collaborators are interested in further innovating these systems to monitor wetlands, marshlands, and ocean water environments.<br/><br/>&#8220;We think it's time that more people are hearing about these fuel cells and how interesting and impactful they could be,&#8221; Josephson said.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="784dee52807270467b8617656136e449"><name>mikros-madrid-exhibit</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New algae exhibit in Madrid: a collaboration that inspires</title><summary>UCSC Arts and Digital Arts &amp; New Media professor Jennifer Parker is the founding director of the OpenLab Collaborative Research Center at UC Santa Cruz, and co-founder of The Algae Society.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate change, visual art, the intersection of art and technology&#8212;how are these connected at UC Santa Cruz and beyond?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short answer is algae, a fascinating and powerful group of organisms. The longer answer relates to several artists, scientists, and designers that have come together to increase awareness about algae. These individuals, known as </span><a href="http://algaesociety.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Algae Society</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Bio Art &amp; Design Lab, explore algae&#8217;s power and create exhibitions worldwide while utilizing algae as a &#8220;non-human research partner.&#8221; Their newest exhibition is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MIKROS: Un Mundo Oculto</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MIKROS: A Hidden World</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) which opened on Nov. 11 at the </span><a href="https://www.planetmad.es/exposicion-mirkos-un-mundo-oculto/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madrid Planetarium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Spain and continues through Jan. 31.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MIKROS is a new multi-sensory audiovisual exhibition that invites viewers to enter a hidden world of drifting algae as an immersive art and science experience. MIKROS aims to create an imaginary world of the overlooked unicellular algae, cyanobacteria, or foraminifera in support of life on Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We hope visitors to MIKROS walk away from the show feeling the power and curiosity of algae as an incredible species supporting life as we know it on the planet,&#8221; says Jennifer Parker, co-founder of the Algae Society and UCSC Arts and Digital Arts &amp; New Media Professor. &#8220;Our wish is for the exhibition to spark joy and excitement with respect for the biodiversity of our planet.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parker is the founding director of the OpenLab Collaborative Research Center at UC Santa Cruz. She co-founded The Algae Society in 2019 with several artists and scientists, including Jos&#233; Carlos Espinel, who resides in Madrid and serves as director/organizer for The Society&#8217;s Madrid operations. He is a Professor in Art at Bellas Artes Universidad Complutense in Madrid, where he created the Sostenibilidad, Ciencia y Arte, or Sustainability, Science and Art (SCIART) Research Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parker and Espinel co-curated MIKROS and contributed works as artists. One of their goals with MIKROS is &#8220;to bring people across generations together to be as inspired by Algae as we are,&#8221; says Parker. In addition to founding directors Parker and Espinel, there are several founding members and participants from across the globe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Society&#8217;s members hope that as people visit MIKROS, they will be motivated to learn more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to be a conversation starter for folks&#8212;to provide an embodied experience that includes all human senses and engages people in real-time to explore and feel the creativity of the ocean and human strivings to embrace wonder and awe,&#8221; says Parker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When The Algae Society creates exhibitions, they utilize a variety of algal species. These range from the microscopic scales of phytoplankton and chlorophytes to the giant kelp of the Pacific Northwest and the Sargassum blooms in the Atlantic Ocean. MIKROS primarily focuses on the &#8220;micro scales,&#8221; but larger seaweeds and kelps will also be present.&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Inspiration for The Algae Society&#160;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The roots of The Algae Society go back many years. Parker established OpenLab, a faculty-led center focused on interdisciplinary research covering science, art, technology, and community, in 2010. In 2012, she worked on a project called Blue Trail: Imagination + Innovation for Ocean Sustainability. Gene Felice, at the time a graduate student in the Digital Arts and New Media MFA program, was working with Parker in OpenLab.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He pitched an idea to create a project with phytoplankton as part of that initiative,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Shortly after, Gene accepted a faculty position and established his own studio/lab (Coaction lab), enabling us to continue working together and developing interdisciplinary mixed media projects with phytoplankton.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, Parker and Felice invited global artists and scientists working at the intersection of art, technology, design, and ecology to expand what they had been doing with phytoplankton to include all species of algae. Parker says the open collaboration hatched the idea of being a &#8216;society&#8217; that could engage locally and globally.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ideas behind OpenLab are fundamentally connected to the philosophy of The Algae Society. Four founding members of The Society&#8212;Dr. Juniper Harrower and David Harris, in addition to Espinel and Felice&#8212;worked with Parker in OpenLab when they were graduate students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is a special place to experiment and push the boundaries of what is possible. &#8220;They all share a deep interest and connection to their research beyond the confines of any discipline. OpenLab helped fund and support projects they were working on and tapped into the intrinsically human need for creativity in support of knowledge building &#8212;as individuals curious about the world and our position as humans on the planet,&#8221; Parker says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working together across the arts and sciences enables them to share resources, push the boundaries of interdisciplinary work, and support more opportunities for public engagement around climate change issues, which is at the core of OpenLab&#8217;s collective motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything Parker does as a professor and OpenLab director comes from her roots as a creative practitioner.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No matter if we call it teaching, practice, or service, it all has the potential to transform Society. I see how we live, work, and teach as one piece that we can contribute to the community. This belief is also part of the cultural identity I bring to my position at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Algae fun fact</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know algae first came into this world more than a billion years ago? This was specifically &#8220;unicellular algae.&#8221; By producing oxygen, algae changed our planet. Algae has gone through some alterations since then. Today, algae contribute nearly 70% of the Earth&#8217;s oxygen and absorb up to half of our CO2.

Beck is adding a new role to his resume: director of the campus&#8217; recently announced <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/07/keynote-state-budget.html">Center for Coastal Climate Resilience</a>. The center is part of the university&#8217;s renewed research focus on climate change, resilience, and coastal sustainability. Beck assumed his director position on Nov. 1.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am honored and excited about the opportunity to lead the Center for the University,&#8221; said Beck, who is a research professor in the Institute of Marine Sciences and an adjunct professor in Ocean Sciences and the Coastal Science and Policy Program. &#8220;The Center will focus our campus efforts on addressing the challenges we face from climate change and in identifying solutions that can benefit people and nature in coastal communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beck, who holds the AXA Chair in Coastal Resilience, also recently started as co-director of the new <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/nsf-coastal-hub.html">Climate Risks and Equitable Nature-based Solutions Hub</a>, backed by a $20 million National Science Foundation grant to assess climate risks in coastal communities.&#160;</p>
<p>Beck has extensive expertise in assessing coastal risk and identifying solutions to reduce these risks for vulnerable communities. He has overseen the <a href="https://coastalresilience.ucsc.edu">Coastal Resilience Lab</a> on campus for more than 20 years and, for much of that time, served as Lead Marine Scientist for The Nature Conservancy.&#160;</p>
<p>The focus of the Center for Coastal Climate Resilience will be to engage partners across communities, agencies, and businesses to advance innovative solutions that build resilience to climate change on our coasts. It aims to establish UCSC further in addressing these challenges in California and beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;Climate change is putting people and nature at great risk on our coasts in California, the U.S., and worldwide. The center will focus on solutions to address these risks and to help to build resilience to them,&#8221; said John MacMillan, interim vice chancellor for the Office of Research, which is heading up the center&#8217;s efforts.</p>
<p>University leaders emphasize that partnerships will be essential to the success of identifying and implementing solutions as the center ramps up its work.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz has a huge role to play in building the workforce needed to address the challenges of climate change, and the center will help to grow and engage these dynamic leaders,&#8221; said UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;It will take all of us in public and private partnership to make our coasts safer and more resilient in the face of climate change.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="78aa97b5807270467b861765631c39ec"><name>2022-highlycited</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>List of most highly cited researchers features 19 UCSC scientists and engineers</title><summary>A new list of the world's most highly cited researchers includes 19 scientists and engineers at UC Santa Cruz.&#13;

The events were conducted by Physical Planning, Development and Operations (PPDO) and Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) to better understand what works and what could be improved for campus travelers. Feedback received will be incorporated into a draft toolkit of implementation measures that best meets the campus's needs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the great turnout last week and thoughtful responses we received, we will no longer be conducting the tabling events this week, originally scheduled for Oakes and East Remote parking lots. Additional campus engagement will occur in Winter and Spring 2023.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For questions about the project, or if you were not able to attend a tabling session and would like to send feedback about your transportation experience via email, or would like to participate in a focus group in early 2023, please contact Physical and Environmental Planning Services at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pep@ucsc.edu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the subject line: TRANSPORTATION FEEDBACK.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="78cf29f4807270467b86176511a8c31f"><name>digital-scholarship-applications</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Applications for the 2022–23 Undergraduate Digital Scholarship Fellowships are open</title><summary>The University Library Center for Digital Scholarship invites applications for the 2022–23 Undergraduate Digital Scholarship Fellowship.</summary><start-date>1668412800000</start-date><path>/2022/11/digital-scholarship-applications</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/11/digital-scholarship-applications</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1668474153441</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1668474153441</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}" data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The University Library Center for Digital Scholarship invites applications for the 2022&#8211;23 Undergraduate Digital Scholarship Fellowship.

The prestigious grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation will fund the creation of a new media work related to the history of Santa Cruz&#8217;s Chinatowns. The piece, presented by </span><a href="https://www.santacruzmah.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (MAH) and also supported by the </span><a href="https://ari.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arts Research Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at UCSC, will make its debut in 2024.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://susanaruiz.org/last-chinatown"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Last Chinatown&#8221; </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(working title) is an interactive public memorial and augmented reality film. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the lens of historical erasure, the work speaks to the rich narrative landscape of Santa Cruz with a focus on its last Chinatown. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a performative interpretation of an original story by author and UCSC Professor Emerita of Literature Karen Tei Yamashita supported with insights from community members and historical documents. The final work will incorporate theater and gameplay and will be experienced on mobile devices, including augmented reality glasses, at historically important sites in downtown Santa Cruz to render visible the lives, legacies, and labors of those who lived there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz had four distinct Chinatowns throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Chinese immigrants, who were fundamental in building California&#8217;s infrastructure and furthering its economy, were confined to the limits of these Chinatowns, where they often shared space with other individuals who had been marginalized by the infrastructures of white supremacy. They were precarious sites subject to repeated floods and fires. Santa Cruz&#8217;s last Chinatown, located in present-day downtown just two blocks from the MAH, was swept away by the overflowing San Lorenzo River on Christmas night 1955.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruiz and Truong, who have long had an interest in the erased histories of BIPOC communities in Santa Cruz, were unaware of the existence of the city&#8217;s Chinatowns until they attended a 2018 performance by dancer, choreographer, and UCSC Professor of Performance, Play &amp; Design Cynthia Ling Lee in which she embodied characters spanning a century of Chinese presence in the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruiz and Truong were shocked. &#8220;How could there be no remnants of these neighborhoods in this progressive community?&#8221; says Ruiz. &#8220;They were invisible completely. But our archival research made us very intrigued by these communities. These Chinatowns were a place for many BIPOC people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duo&#8217;s research led them to a number of history-makers and leaders in the Santa Cruz AAPI community, including George Ow Jr., an elder and one of the last residents with memories of living in the last Chinatown. Ow&#8217;s vivid stories offered tantalizing opportunities to use AR technology to place people physically in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;George&#8217;s grandmother had a large garden next to the river,&#8221; says Truong. &#8220;Participants will be able to stand next to the river on that spot&#8212;with the sound of the water, the smell of the plants, and the wind on their skin&#8212;and experience his story through AR and volumetric filmmaking in the actual space. It&#8217;s so immersive and compelling.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are both media artists,&#8221; adds Ruiz. &#8220;We are intrigued by technologies that allow us to tell stories in a new way. Most of the ways we experience stories don&#8217;t ask us to think about our bodies in the space. The physicality is such a strong component of the work. We&#8217;re so excited to be working with Karen Tei Yamashita to bring story, history, embodiment, and space to life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruiz and Truong, who is also a former Lecturer in Film and Digital Media at UCSC, have long partnered artistically. They are founding partners, with documentary filmmaker Ashley York, of the multiple award-winning </span><a href="https://susanaruiz.org/takeactiongames"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Action Games</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (TAG), an artist&#8217;s studio with a portfolio traversing games, art, justice activism, and storytelling. Their work has garnered multiple accolades. TAG&#8217;s game &#8220;Darfur is Dying&#8221; earned the studio the prestigious Governor's Award (the Emmy's highest honor) at the 2006 Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Emmys as a core component of the MTV transmedia campaign in Sudan and was presented to members of the U.S. Congress in the United States Capitol during the National Online Town Hall Meeting on Darfur. TAG&#8217;s &#8220;RePlay: Finding Zoe/ReJouer: O&#249; est Zo&#233;?&#8221; was honored with the Adobe 2009 MAX Award for Social Responsibility and was included in a United Nations report titled &#8220;The Global Assessment on Women&#8217;s Safety&#8221; as an exemplar of an innovative partnership between a social justice organization and a media developer.&#160;</span></p>

<p>Researchers have found two exceptionally bright galaxies that existed approximately 350 and 450 million years after the big bang. These and other observations are nudging astronomers toward a consensus that an unusual number of galaxies in the early universe were much brighter than expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve nailed something that is incredibly fascinating. These galaxies would have to have started coming together maybe just 100 million years after the big bang. Nobody expected that the dark ages would have ended so early,&#8221; said Garth Illingworth, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;The primal universe would have been just one hundredth its current age. It&#8217;s a sliver of time in the 13.8-billion-year-old evolving cosmos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two research papers, led by Marco Castellano of the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome, Italy, and Rohan Naidu of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have been published in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. Illingworth is a coauthor of the Naidu et al. paper.</p>
<p>These initial findings are from a broader JWST research initiative involving two Early Release Science (ERS) programs: the Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS), and the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS).</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything we see is new. Webb is showing us that there's a very rich universe beyond what we imagined,&#8221; said Tommaso Treu at UCLA, a principal investigator on one of the Webb programs. &#8220;Once again, the universe has surprised us. These early galaxies are very unusual in many ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>With just four days of analysis, researchers found the two exceptionally bright galaxies in the GLASS-JWST images. These galaxies existed approximately 450 and 350 million years after the big bang (with a redshift of approximately 10.5 and 12.5, respectively). Future spectroscopic measurements with JWST are needed to confirm their distances.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the distances of these early sources still need to be confirmed with spectroscopy, their extreme brightnesses are a real puzzle, challenging our understanding of galaxy formation,&#8221; noted Pascal Oesch at the University of Geneva in Switzerlandd, second author of the Naidu et al. paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Webb, we were amazed to find the most distant starlight that anyone had ever seen, just days after Webb released its first data," said Naidu of the more distant GLASS galaxy, referred to as GLASS-z12, which is believed to date back to 350 million years after big bang. The previous record holder is galaxy GN-z11, which existed 400 million years after the big bang (redshift 11.1) and was identified in 2016 by Hubble and Keck Observatory in deep-sky programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on all the predictions, we thought we had to search a much bigger volume of space to find such galaxies,&#8221; said Castellano.</p>
<p>Another surprise was the discovery of galaxies with compact disks at such early times, which was only possible because of JWST&#8217;s much sharper images, in infrared light, compared to Hubble.</p>
<p>"Our team was struck by being able to measure the shapes of these first galaxies; their calm, orderly disks question our understanding of how the first galaxies formed in the crowded, chaotic early universe," said team member Erica Nelson of the University of Colorado.</p>
<p>Illingworth emphasized the two bright galaxies found by these teams have a lot of light. He said one option is that they could have been very massive, with lots of low-mass stars, like later galaxies. Alternatively, they could be much less massive, consisting of far fewer extraordinarily bright stars, known as Population III stars. Long theorized, they would be the first stars ever born, blazing at blistering temperatures and made up only of primordial hydrogen and helium&#8212;before stars could later cook up heavier elements in their nuclear fusion furnaces. No such extremely hot, primordial stars are seen in the local universe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, the farthest source is very compact, and its colors seem to indicate that its stellar population is particularly devoid of heavy elements and could even contain some Population III stars. Only Webb spectra will tell,&#8221; said Adriano Fontana, second author of the Castellano et al. paper and a member of the GLASS-JWST team.</p>
<p>Present Webb distance estimates to these two galaxies are based on measuring their infrared colors. Eventually, follow-up spectroscopy measurements showing how light has been stretched in the expanding universe will provide independent verification of these cosmic yardstick measurements.</p>
<p>&#8220;The secrets of the earliest galaxies are only now starting to be revealed by Webb&#8212;the real discoveries lie ahead,&#8221; Illingworth said.</p>

The first floor is now named for alumna Kathryn Sullivan, an astronaut and earth scientist who has been called &#8220;the world&#8217;s most vertical person&#8221; for having been the first person to both walk in space and reach the earth&#8217;s deepest ocean point. This floor is inspired by the sea &#8211; both themes are reflected in the decoration of the spaces.<br/><br/>In naming the two floors after successful women scientists, the Science &amp; Engineering Library is designed to inspire women and students from historically marginalized backgrounds who are pursuing STEM degrees and careers.<br/><br/>&#8220;Both Sandy and Kathy have helped UC Santa Cruz become a place where students, irrespective of identity or background, can enter a space of learning, such as this library, and dream about what is possible &#8211; and then go out and do it,&#8221; said Elizabeth Cowell, UCSC&#8217;s university librarian, at the dedication event.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>The Faber third floor initially opened in January of 2020, but was then closed until July 2022 due to the pandemic. During this time, the first floor renovations were planned and executed, supported by the empty campus but stymied by supply chain difficulties.&#160;<br/><br/>Improvements to the library, which were guided by extensive feedback from representatives of the campus community, including students, include moveable furniture, increased outlets, collaboration spaces with whiteboards, compact shelving to allow for more efficient use of space and growth of the collection, and the new makerspace called the Digital Scholarship Innovation Studio. A mix of quiet areas and collaborative spaces are available to suit students&#8217; needs.<br/><br/>&#8220;Libraries might not be the first things that come to mind when contemplating student success, but they should be,&#8221; said UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive at the dedication event. &#8220;The great University libraries of today, like ours, are assembled with students in mind. This space functions almost as a student union &#8211; it&#8217;s a safe, functional, and flexible space for undergraduate and graduate students. Student success is all about removing barriers, and I am excited to say that this new library space, and the library staff inside it, do just that.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>The Digital Scholarship Innovation Studio, located on the first floor, is a makerspace available to all students, staff, and faculty. The space was designed to democratize access to technology, increase collaboration, and foster open experimentation and innovation.<br/><br/>The Innovation Studio offers a variety of equipment, including two types of 3D printers, four laser cutters, 3-D modeling tools, a Realfiction Dreamoc Diamond display for holographic visualizations, and the training to use the tools.&#160;<br/><br/>The Science &amp; Engineering library now hosts one of two <a href="library-kiosks.xml">laptop kiosks</a> on campus, which increases access to technology by offering students Dell laptops to be checked out for free on a first-come, first-served basis for up to four hours. The building also now has several gender-neutral restrooms and a lactation room.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Students have been able to return to (somewhat) normalcy this year, and part of that is meeting your friends or study partners at the library,&#8221; Cowell said. &#8220;We are so thrilled that we could provide students with an updated Science &amp; Engineering library that meets their needs."<br/><br/>The second floor has yet to be named.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these existing educational inequalities, requiring new solutions to democratize access to this field.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">UC Santa Cruz researchers have developed a method for using remote-controlled, internet-connected microscopes to enable students anywhere in the world to participate in designing and carrying out biology experiments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(22)02884-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2405844022028845%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">A new study</a> in the journal <i>Heliyon</i> details this novel and scalable framework for bringing project-based STEM education to students who otherwise would not have access. The researchers implemented the microscope technology in the biology classrooms of several Latinx communities in the United States and Latin America, and found their technology to be</span><span class="s2"> an effective and scalable approach for giving students underrepresented in STEM the ability to conduct complex experiments remotely.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Taking an internet-connected camera and putting it into the viewpiece of a microscope is something that a lot of labs could do,&#8221; said Pierre Baudin, a computer engineering Ph.D. student at the Baskin School of Engineering and first-author on the paper. &#8220;By laying out the framework in this paper, the idea was to create a roadmap so any lab that feels some kind of mission or desire to create educational resources for their community or others may be able to set up a similar kind of experiment, allowing this concept to spread.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tissue culture experiments are typically unheard of in high school and even the first few years of college, and yet in user studies run for this research, underserved highschool students at Alisal High School in the rural Salinas Valley near Santa Cruz were able to do these experiments.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We are allowing students to do experiments that are normally not feasible for [many] schools around the world, either because the materials are hazardous or because the equipment is expensive or requires specific training for both the teachers and the students,&#8221; said Mohammed Mostajo-Radji, the senior researcher on this study.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Developing the new method</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While project-based learning has proven to be an effective method for teaching STEM concepts, it is restricted by barriers such as cost and logistics of shipping materials to isolated communities, limited teacher training, under-resourced schools, and potential exposure to hazardous materials. Through deep experience working with education non-profits, UCSC Genomics Institute&#8217;s Mostajo-Radji determined that a successful solution needs to be scalable and affordable, adaptable to a school&#8217;s local context, and allow students to fully explore the scientific method.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mostajo-Radji and many other researchers at the UCSC Genomics Institute involved in this project believe running complex biology experiments via remote-controlled microscopes can be a solution that fits these criteria.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The technology that powers these remote experiments was originally developed to enable researchers from multiple geographically-separate institutions to collaborate on stem-cell research as part of a multi-institution group called the <a href="https://braingeneers.ucsc.edu/team/"><span class="s3">Braingeneers</span></a>. Graduate students Baudin and Victoria Ly developed the tool to control microscopes remotely from anywhere in the world, to enable non-invasive observation of cell cultures in incubators.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mostajo-Radji, who was formerly the Bolivian Ambassador for Science, Technology and Innovation, recognized that the microscopy technology could be leveraged for remote education amid growing equity educational gaps during the pandemic.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;[The remote-controlled microscopes] were not developed for the purpose of education,&#8221; Mostajo-Radji said. &#8220;What we did was take a lot of lessons that we learned from mine and others&#8217; nonprofit work to build something that is pretty remarkable.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mostajo-Radji believes this paper is the first to describe a method that is both truly remote and fully using the scientific method, bringing inquiry and active learning into lessons, which can be especially important for students who are less memorization-based learners.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Learning from students worldwide&#160;</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The paper outlines a framework for other labs and classrooms to run remote-controlled experiments, in which students design an experiment, make observations, analyze data, and present their findings.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The researchers learned from several user studies which employed this method locally with Advanced Placement Biology students at Alisal High School in Salinas, and abroad with students from two different universities in Bolivia and multinational students involved with the nonprofit organization Science Clubs International. The experiments were conducted in Santa Cruz and San Francisco and accessed completely remotely by the students. Each group&#8217;s lessons reflected the student&#8217;s local context and augmented an already existing curriculum.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first pilot of the program began in Fall 2020 at the height of the pandemic. Programs varied among the different groups, typically running about eight weeks. The researchers met weekly for lessons with some of the groups of students, and with other groups they gave a&#160; tutorial on how to use the technology at the beginning and allowed them to run the experiments independently.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One experiment that was run with students in Salinas was a &#8220;clinical trial in a dish&#8221; which allowed students to see the effect of novel drugs on neuroblastoma, a cancerous tumor, in cell lines. In other experiments, students studied the biocompatibility of custom-made gold and graphene nanoparticles</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Surveys run at the end of the user-study programs showed that this method positively impacted STEM identity among both cohorts, although more strongly among Bolivian students, and led to an overall increased interest in STEM for participating students. These results offered an opportunity to understand STEM motivation among Latinx populations without the extrapolation of conclusions from one, geographically-limited study.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;For a lot of these education strategies and policies, [researchers] like to think that a study done in a particular region of the world is representative to inform policy in a different part of the world,&#8221; Mostajo-Radji said. &#8220;Here, for the first time, we are thoroughly comparing&#160; groups of Hispanics [in California] and Hispanics abroad, in the context of the exact same class, exact same lesson, and exact same experiments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Expanding the program</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The team is now in the process of applying for grants to build the infrastructure to expand this work. They envision an app that would allow high school and community college students from anywhere in the world who might not otherwise go into research to design and execute experiments completely remotely. The researchers recently created the <a href="https://genomics.ucsc.edu/cloud-based-technologies/"><span class="s3">Live Cell Biotechnology Discovery Lab</span></a> to scale up the use of their technology.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally, they would have hundreds of microscopes running different experiments. Mostajo-Radji imagines that students from different parts of the world could be in the same group and learn from the same data together.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The researchers are actively looking for more partners through conferences to create relationships beyond the schools they worked with for this study. To this end, Mostajo-Radji recently was invited to join the U.S. National Academy of Sciences at the International Frontiers Symposium in Nairobi, Kenya to share this idea and create educational partnerships to bring these technologies to more students.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The researchers are also interested in moving beyond microscopy. Areas of interest include devices to teach programming through microfluidics, and techniques for teaching electrophysiology, the study of the electrical properties of biological cells and tissues, to non-visual learners.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Microscopy, in a way, was a low-hanging fruit,&#8221; Mostajo-Radji said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just the beginning.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">UCSC graduate students Raina Sacksteder, Atesh Worthington, Kateryna Voitiuk, and Victoria Ly were all major contributors to this study. This work was supported by the Schmidt Futures initiative and the National Science Foundation.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

400;">Underscoring more than a half century of pioneering work in organic farming, University of California President Michael V. Drake announced today that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIfuMExrgX0">UC Santa Cruz will be designated as an Agricultural Experiment Station</a> (AES).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz and UC Merced are the first campuses to receive this designation in 50 years, and join UC Davis, UC Berkeley and UC Riverside as AES campuses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Both UC Santa Cruz and UC Merced have long conducted research on agricultural issues, so it is appropriate that these campuses also receive this designation and have their work recognized as contributing to the overall UC agriculture research portfolio,&#8221; said President Drake. &#8220;Congratulations to these two new campuses on this wonderful milestone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AES is a system of campus-based scientists with the mission to develop cutting-edge knowledge and technologies to address agricultural, natural resources, and health issues. UC's AES faculty conduct land-grant mission research and transfer basic and applied knowledge to the public through UC Cooperative Extension offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our campus has been working toward this designation for some time and I&#8217;m so pleased that the hard work of our faculty and staff has paid off,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;UC Santa Cruz has a more than 50-year track record of pioneering work in organic farming and building sustainable food systems. This designation will allow us to continue building programs and have a positive impact on our community and on the wider field of sustainable, regenerative agriculture.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading at the intersection of innovation and social justice, UC Santa Cruz has a long history of ground-breaking work in agroecology and regenerative agriculture. The campus has a well-earned reputation as a </span><a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2017/03/strawberry-fields-for-better/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trailblazer in organic agriculture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a standing supported by continued efforts among campus researchers to find new ways to fight agricultural disease and pests without using chemicals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz was a pioneer in organic agriculture and sustainable farming and is unique for the longevity of our work in those fields,&#8221; said Carol Shennan, emeritus professor of environmental studies and former director of the campus Center for Agroecology. &#8220;This designation will allow the campus to broaden our community impact by continuing to expand on the foundation already in place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://agroecology.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Agroecology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, rooted in the Social Sciences Division, brings a social justice perspective to envision an equitable future for food systems. Founded more than 50 years ago, the center created an intersectional space for researchers to study the science, policy and community aspects of organic and sustainable agriculture.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we&#8217;re really changing food systems and access to sustainable agriculture, we need to create spaces where people who have deep knowledge and experience, like farm and farmworker families, help shape the system as it grows,&#8221; said Darryl Wong, executive director for the Center of Agroecology. &#8220;UC Santa Cruz is very well positioned to lead that work, from an interdisciplinary perspective.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz has played a vital role in the flourishing of organic farming on the Central Coast and beyond, through undergraduate education, training provided by the apprenticeship programs, and faculty research projects. The Central Coast is well known around the world for the high concentration of organic production, and UC Santa Cruz is internationally recognized as a hub of organic activity and expertise.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven Gliessman, emeritus professor of environmental studies, led the groundbreaking research on organic strawberry farming that transformed the industry. UC Santa Cruz researchers continue to work to find profitable alternatives to chemical use in agriculture.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joji Muramoto, a Cooperative Extension specialist with the Center for Agroecology and the first Cooperative Extension specialist dedicated to organic agriculture, coordinates a statewide program focused on the organic production of strawberries and vegetables. The center is in the process of hiring an additional specialist, as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Agroecology offers an apprenticeship program that immerses seasoned beginners in experiential study of soil health and cultivation, plant physiology, and crop production and distribution. Around the world, graduates of the program are improving the health of the environment through organic food production, education, advocacy, and social service programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center manages the Alan Chadwick Garden, a 3-acre organic and bio-diverse garden on the UCSC campus founded in 1967, and the UCSC Farm, a 30-acre organic farm founded in 1971 that serves as an outdoor classroom and research site. For more than 50 years these sites have hosted students, residential apprentices, and community members who learn about organic gardening, farming, and the food system.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe the new AES designation will facilitate the continued success of the UC Santa Cruz Farm in supporting relevant on-farm research with the goal of improving our collective ability to sustainably produce food for our communities in a rapidly changing environment,&#8221; said Jim Leap, former UCSC Farm manager.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center staff participate in interdisciplinary research projects that focus primarily on improving organic farming practices and increasing the sustainability of local food systems. They collaborate with UC Santa Cruz faculty and students, local farmers and gardeners, the UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources (UCANR), and others to study farming and food systems issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having worked with the Center for Agroecology for over 15 years, it has been an incredible journey to see how the projects we have stewarded impact the Central Coast, the state, and connect to national and international dimensions of the food system.&#8221; said Tim Galarneau, UCSC food systems education and research specialist. &#8220;I look forward to advancing new and innovative efforts from the field to the plate."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building on work happening in the Environmental Studies department and at the Center for Agroecology, a new </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/04/casfs-agroecology.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agroecology undergraduate major</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was introduced in fall 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The undergraduate bachelor of arts degree rounds out UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s programming in agroecology, adding to pioneering faculty research, hands-on experience for students and transformational alumni contributions to the field and organic farming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The AES designation expands our capacity to do research, but it also codifies this sense of community involvement and engagement that is at the core of the work we do,&#8221; said Wong. &#8220;This is an agricultural experiment station for the community.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="82430e59807270467d37c581153260da"><name>negotiations-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCOP negotiation update</title><summary>To keep you informed on the UC systemwide labor negotiations with the four United Auto Workers (UAW) bargaining units, I want to share this update from Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Michael T.

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep you informed on the UC systemwide labor negotiations with the four United Auto Workers (UAW) bargaining units, I want to share this update from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Michael T. Brown. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It includes information on what UC has offered the units, contextualization of costs, and proposals UC has made to the union to use a third-party mediator.&#160;</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The negotiations are ongoing and we will share additional information as we learn more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am grateful for all you are doing in support of our students and to ensure that our students are able to continue learning through this labor strike.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sincerely,<br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lori</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lori Kletzer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</span></p>
<hr/>
<p>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Colleagues:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After months of earnest good faith negotiations, over 50 bargaining sessions, and progress on a range of issues important to our academic employees and graduate students, union members have chosen to strike. I respect their choice and am writing to inform you of the University&#8217;s latest offers, to update you on negotiations, and to provide information on the outstanding areas of disagreement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our ability to attract and enroll top talent is core to UC&#8217;s teaching and research missions, which is why we aim to offer the best support we can. The part-time, professionally relevant work in which student employees engage helps recruit and support them while they earn their graduate degrees or, particularly in the case of postdocs, prepare to advance in their careers as scholars. The University is committed to achieving agreements that allow us to provide this support during their training. The current offers from the University reflect this aim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under our current proposals, our academic student employees would be among the highest compensated among public universities in the Association of American Universities (AAU), with compensation similar to what top private institutions offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Details about our offers and the Union&#8217;s requests are available below:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several areas separate us from the UAW&#8217;s proposal, however. The first area is a proposal by the Union to tie compensation directly to local housing costs. We are clear that housing costs are a significant challenge for many Californians. We will continue to work diligently to provide support to our students in this area through below-market housing programs and other means.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tying compensation directly to housing costs, however, could have overwhelming financial impacts on the University. One review of the Union&#8217;s proposal predicts an annual unfunded obligation of at least </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hundred million dollars, with inflationary pressure and no cap.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second particularly challenging proposal is waiving out of state tuition for international and other non-resident graduate students. We are a state funded institution; taxpayer funding partially subsidizes the cost of educating California resident students. That subsidy does not exist for non-residents. We have a range of ways in which we support international graduate students, and we work hard to attract the best talent in the world. But if we were to provide remission of out of state supplemental tuition, non-California student employees would in effect receive a larger compensation package than California resident student employees for doing the same work. Note that for all Academic Student Employees (TAs/Readers/Tutors) and Graduate Student Researchers with a 25% appointment or greater, UC already covers $13,707 to $22,248 for tuition and fees, depending on the charges assessed by the campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note the increases in compensation under our proposal. Our current offer to the Union represents an average 7.2% increase for ASEs, and 10.5% for GSRs in wages.&#160; Specifically, UC has offered pay increases for ASEs and GSRs that range in increases from 5% to 26% (see chart above).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also important to note that ASEs and GSRs are limited to 50% appointments. Under UC&#8217;s current wage proposals, salaried ASEs/GSRs will have salaries ranging from $24,874 to $47,012, for 50% time. In contrast, the Union is proposing a salary range of $54,084 to $97,775 for ASEs/GSRs for 50% appointments. In other words, the University is offering salary range increases averaging 7-10%, whereas the union is requesting average increases of approximately 120% for 50% appointments.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other areas where the University has offered additional support include enhancements to paid leaves and childcare reimbursements &#8212; key Union concerns. In addition, we have reached tentative agreements with the Union on many other important areas including work environment and health and safety matters.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We negotiated throughout this past weekend and will continue to do so. Recognizing the fundamental differences remaining, we have proposed to the UAW that the University and the Union engage with a third-party mediator as a way to move forward. We hope the Union accepts our invitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope that we will be able to come to a fair and responsible resolution with the Union as soon as possible so that we can get fully back to the business of teaching and research.&#160; We will continue to update you as things progress, and please reach out if you have any questions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>

Yet offshore wind farms pose significant risks to seabirds and other marine wildlife.</p>
<p>A new study led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz outlines a framework for addressing the impacts of offshore wind farms on marine bird populations and highlights conservation strategies that could potentially more than offset those impacts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all want wind energy, but we also want to make sure it can be sustainably produced,&#8221; said lead author Donald Croll, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Coauthor Aspen Ellis, a doctoral student in Croll&#8217;s <a href="https://ccal.ucsc.edu/">Conservation Action Lab</a>, explained that funding from offshore wind energy development can be used to reduce other threats to seabird populations. This can be effective with seabirds because studies have shown significant increases in their populations after interventions such as removing invasive species from nesting sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a case where we have the data and the knowledge to make it work,&#8221; Ellis said. &#8220;Seabirds breed in colonies, so their populations are concentrated there during the breeding season and conservation strategies can have a big impact. We have a suite of proven tools to increase seabird population sizes, as well as established methods that can predict the population-level impact of these different tools on each seabird species.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seabirds are already the most highly threatened group of birds. The potential impacts of offshore wind farms include displacement of birds from areas where they forage for food and direct mortality from collisions with the blades of wind turbines. Both displacement and mortality can have detrimental effects on the overall population of an affected species.</p>
<p>Croll and Ellis worked with an international team of experts on seabirds and wind energy to study these issues and how to address them. They came up with a comprehensive framework, published <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320722003482">November 10 in <em>Biological Conservation</em></a>, for assessing and mitigating the impacts of offshore wind farms on marine birds.</p>
<p>While the impacts of land-based wind turbines on eagles and other raptors have been well documented, assessing the impact of offshore facilities on seabirds is more challenging.</p>
<p>&#8220;On land you can find carcasses under the turbines, but in the ocean they just disappear,&#8221; Croll said.</p>
<p>In the absence of effective monitoring techniques, collision risk models can still provide useful estimates of collision frequencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been studying these species for years, so we have a fair amount of information from surveys and tracking studies about what species are out there and where they go,&#8221; Croll said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve also been developing population models that can be used to assess the impacts on seabird populations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study outlined three steps for mitigating environmental impacts: avoid, minimize, and offset. While efforts can and should be made to avoid and reduce the impacts of wind energy development on marine birds as much as possible, the researchers concluded that eliminating impacts is impossible with avoidance and minimization approaches alone.</p>
<p>Offsetting the impacts (also called &#8220;compensatory mitigation&#8221;) offers the potential for wind energy development to have a net positive effect on seabird populations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t have to be a choice between addressing climate change or protecting wildlife&#8212;it could be a win-win for both. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to do here,&#8221; Ellis said.</p>
<p>In addition to eliminating invasive species from islands where seabirds breed, researchers have also had success moving seabirds from existing colonies to other sites, either to establish new breeding colonies or to restore colonies that were extirpated in the past. Mitigation funding could also be used to implement strategies for reducing seabird bycatch in fisheries.</p>
<p>&#8220;These interventions can be expensive, and there&#8217;s a limit to the funding available from government agencies and nonprofits,&#8221; Croll said. &#8220;I&#8217;m hoping the funding from offshore wind energy development will increase the resources available for these interventions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study presents a broad framework that can be applied globally for assessing and mitigating the impacts of offshore wind energy development. Extensive offshore wind farms have been developed in Europe and the United Kingdom. In the United States, offshore wind energy is starting to grow on the East Coast, but until recently it has not been feasible on the West Coast, where the continental shelf drops off quickly into deep water.</p>
<p>With the development of technologies for floating wind turbines, however, there is increasing interest on the West Coast. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has identified two areas on California&#8217;s coast for wind energy leases, one on the North Coast near Humboldt County and the other on the Central Coast near Morro Bay.</p>
<p>Ellis is currently applying the approach outlined in the study to evaluate potential wind energy developments on the West Coast, with support from NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries through a 2022 Nancy Foster Scholarship.</p>
<p>In addition to Croll and Ellis, the coauthors of the paper include scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey, British Trust for Ornithology, Research and Technology Center (Kiel, Germany), Biodiversity Research Institute, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, NOAA Fisheries, American Bird Conservancy, National Ocean Service, Audubon Seabird Institute, Conservation Metrics, Waardenburg Ecology (Netherlands), UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology, Ecological Dynamics Group (Netherlands), Blue Point Conservation Science, Pacific Rim Conservation, and Nhydra Ecological (Canada).</p>
<p>This research was supported by BOEM through a grant to the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at UC Santa Barbara.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8bdcda8b8072704633327addcb372170"><name>testing-after-breaks</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Fall and winter break return testing and flu vaccine reminder</title><summary>With fall and winter breaks quickly approaching, we would like to share some important information about COVID testing and a reminder regarding the flu vaccine requirement.</summary><start-date>1668672000000</start-date><display-name>Fall and winter break return testing and flu vaccine reminder</display-name><path>/2022/11/testing-after-breaks</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/11/testing-after-breaks</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1668793817719</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1668793817719</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>(Unit Managers and Supervisors: Please post a paper copy of this message for people in your area who do not have regular computer access.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we look forward to the upcoming fall and winter breaks, we are writing to share guidance to&#160; help our campus community mitigate the spread of influenza and COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 Break Testing Guidance</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are traveling over fall break, we strongly encourage you to take a COVID-19 rapid antigen test before returning to campus, especially if you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop symptoms&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have known contact with a positive COVID case</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel to an area where infection rates are high</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attend a high risk event&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling sick? It could be COVID-19 or the flu. Stay home &amp; away from others, take a COVID-19 test, and call your doctor if you have any symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, new loss of taste or smell, or sore throat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you test positive for COVID, please delay your return to campus and follow these </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/covid_positive_directions_students.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 Positive Test Result Instructions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even if your COVID test is negative, do not return to campus if you have flu-like symptoms to help prevent the spread of flu in our community.</span></p>
<p><strong>Where to pick up a Rapid Antigen Test&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapid Antigen Tests are available at the Amah Mutsun COVID testing site, Bay Tree Campus Store, college housing offices, as well as in the Affiliated Residential Community Housing (ARCH) offices. We encourage you to pick up a test before you leave for both the fall and winter breaks so you are prepared to test before your return to campus. Please note that on-campus PCR testing will not be available during fall break. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students remaining on campus over the break can get a rapid test on an as-needed basis. Contact the Resident/Neighborhood Assistant (RA/NA) on call or, during evening hours, a Community Safety Officer (CSO) to get one.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Flu Vaccination Requirement&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder, at UC Santa Cruz, all students are </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/11/student-flu-requirement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required to receive or decline influenza vaccination by December 1, 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Campus Vaccination Clinics</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flu shots and the Moderna </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/vaccinationclinic.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 bivalent booster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be available to students at vaccination clinics on November 30 and December 1 at Stevenson Event Center.

The annual competition draws together student teams from around the globe to present their synthetic biology projects that aim to address 21st century grand challenges.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 350 teams from 45 countries participated in the competition in Paris, France. Team projects presented at the competition focused on timely topics, including climate change, diagnostics, therapeutics, environmental science, manufacturing, and artificial intelligence.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC 2022 iGEM team project, known as Helo, addressed the high costs and limited availability of Type 2 diabetes medication through the production of a yeast-based therapeutic that can be grown locally and affordably.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only did team UCSC win gold at the competition, but they were also one of five projects in their division to be nominated for &#8220;Best Therapeutics Project,&#8221; making them the first team in UCSC iGEM history to receive both a best projects nomination and a gold medal.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="iGEM team member Lauren Paule and co-captain Elizabeth Beer are shown working in the lab." height="200" src="images/paule-beer-in-lab.jpg" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" width="300"/>&#8220;The weight of being nominated for best therapeutics project isn&#8217;t conveyed to the public in the way that it should,&#8221; said Elizabeth Beer, co-captain of this year&#8217;s team and biomolecular engineering (BME) student. &#8220;We were in the second largest division, up against 26 other projects, and to be one of the five best projects nominated was a huge success. We were screaming because we were so happy and proud.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 team includes </span><a href="https://2022.igem.wiki/ucsc/attributions" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">14 Baskin School of Engineering undergraduates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is led by David Bernick, associate teaching professor of biomolecular engineering. Throughout the year, the team received mentorship from UCSC Ph.D. student Eric Malekos and additional support from Hartnell College intern Gabino Guzman. Guzman was selected to join the team through a community engagement partnership between UCSC iGEM and Hartnell College, a community college located in Salinas, CA.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A yeast-based Type 2 diabetes therapeutic&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before carrying out their proof-of-concept in the lab, the team spent months brainstorming, researching, and connecting with global and community health experts, including endocrinologists and UCSC Global Health Professor Matt Sparke, to ensure their project focus was viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, they led a number of community engagement efforts throughout the year, which included participating in local community outreach events, hosting Soquel High students in their lab, working with the </span><a href="https://engineering.wordpress.ucsc.edu/news/girls-in-engineering-2022-program/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Girls in Engineering 2022 summer program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and speaking to students at their former high schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of our goals for our project was to increase accessibility of synthetic biology, starting with our diabetes medication idea and extending to engaging our community members, especially the ones who have been historically underrepresented in STEM, in a conversation about synthetic biology and its benefits,&#8221; said Kiana Imani, co-captain of this year&#8217;s team and BME student.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People living with Type 2 diabetes either lack insulin sensitivity or resist insulin. A class of medication currently used to treat Type 2 diabetes is called GLP1 RA, glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists. GLP1 RA medications enhance insulin secretion, improving insulin sensitivity for diabetic patients, but are expensive and inaccessible to many areas around the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Exendin-4, a commonly used GLP1 RA, is a naturally-derived peptide and can be produced within a microbial host, team UCSC set out to produce a bio-encapsulated version of Exendin-4 using </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;also known as baker&#8217;s yeast&#8212;as the host to ensure the medication can be grown locally and affordably.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="iGEM team member Thiago Brasileiro Feitosa is shown working in the lab." class="" height="200" src="images/thiago.jpg" style="float: right;" width="300"/>Working in the lab every weekday over the summer, the team made major strides in proving their concept and modeling their therapeutic design. After choosing baker&#8217;s yeast as their host organism, they carried out a gene insert design method to produce Exendin-4 in the host organism. By the end of summer, they were successful in inserting the Exendin-4 gene into the yeast&#8217;s genome.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Celebrating project milestones, looking toward the future</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 jamboree was a culmination of the team&#8217;s work completed over the past year. The team fundraised more than enough to send every member to the competition. This was significant for co-captains Beer and Imani, who noted many of the teams at the jamboree were only able to send a few of their members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We knew our fundraising efforts were not complete until we raised enough money to send all 17 of us to the competition,&#8221; Imani explained. &#8220;It was a lot of work, but we did it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first two days of the jamboree, the team presented their project during both closed-door judging sessions and breakout sessions to the public. On the closing day, the celebration began when the team found out they were nominated for &#8220;Best Therapeutics Project&#8221; and won a gold medal.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teams are judged on their virtual project posters, wiki pages, and video presentations. They are awarded gold medals if they demonstrate excellence across multiple categories and uphold the key iGEM principles of respect, community, and honesty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am honored by the persistence that this team brought to the project,&#8221; Bernick said. &#8220;These students, like most of our students, endured a college experience where labs were delivered over Zoom, social interactions were few, and yet this group came together to consider projects of global importance, where the skills of the bioengineer could be brought to bear for the common good. While this is a common trait of UCSC iGEM, it became strongly evident with the 2022 team.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-captains Imani and Beer spoke highly of their team&#8217;s dynamic, praising their team&#8217;s unwavering motivation and dedication and collaborative nature. Along with the captains being pushed to learn valuable leadership and organization skills, every team member had to learn how to work together and leverage each other&#8217;s strengths to progress their project forward. The team quickly became a strong group of friends, bonding over their shared interests in making a positive impact in their communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;iGEM is by far one of the best experiences we&#8217;ve had as undergraduates,&#8221; Beer said. &#8220;This is an experience that I know we'll carry with us forever and will help propel us forward in our future academic and professional careers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several members from the team are interested in moving forward with their project either through independent study work or as an extracurricular activity. Team Helo&#8217;s next steps will focus on bioencapsulation, dosing, and distribution of the yeast-based therapeutic treatment.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

<p>Initial results from observations of WASP-39b with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/08/exoplanet-carbon-dioxide.html">reported in August</a>, included the first unequivocal detection of carbon dioxide in an exoplanet atmosphere. At the time, the team noted an interesting feature in their results but had not yet identified the molecule responsible for it.</p>
<p>Now they have identified the &#8220;mystery molecule&#8221; as sulfur dioxide and determined that it is produced by photochemistry&#8212;chemical reactions in the atmosphere driven by light from the planet&#8217;s host star, similar to the formation of ozone by photochemical reactions in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#8220;The discovery of photochemistry in the atmosphere of a &#8216;hot Jupiter&#8217; exoplanet like WASP-39b is important, allowing us to test our photochemistry models and opening new avenues of investigation,&#8221; said Natalie Batalha, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz who leads the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Early Release Science Team.</p>
<p>The team reported their latest findings in a set of five new papers, three of which are in press and two of which are under review. They observed the planet as it passed in front of its host star, enabling them to analyze the starlight transmitted through the planet&#8217;s atmosphere, using spectroscopy to separate the light into its component wavelengths and reveal the &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; of the molecules that make up the planet&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a panoply of atoms and molecules in the atmosphere of WASP-39b, including sodium, potassium, water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and the mystery molecule, sulfur dioxide,&#8221; Batalha said. &#8220;The process used to identify molecules also gives us information about elemental abundance ratios&#8212;such as the ratios of carbon to oxygen and potassium to oxygen&#8212;which are tracers of planet formation processes.&#8221;</p>
<p>WASP-39 b&#8217;s chemical inventory suggests a history of smashups and mergers of smaller bodies called planetesimals to create an eventual goliath of a planet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The abundance of sulfur [relative to] hydrogen indicated that the planet presumably experienced significant accretion of planetesimals that can deliver [these ingredients] to the atmosphere,&#8221; said Kazumasa Ohno, a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz who worked on the Webb data. &#8220;The data also indicates that the oxygen is a lot more abundant than the carbon in the atmosphere. This potentially indicates that WASP-39 b originally formed far away from the central star.&#8221;</p>
<p>The results also showed evidence of patchy clouds in the exoplanet&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>WASP-39b is a hot Saturn-mass gas giant exoplanet orbiting very close to its host star. Its close orbit and high temperature are typical of the abundant &#8220;hot Jupiter&#8221; class of exoplanets. The planet&#8217;s proximity to its host star&#8212;eight times closer than Mercury is to our Sun&#8212;makes it a laboratory for studying the effects of radiation from host stars on exoplanets. Better knowledge of the star-planet connection should bring a deeper understanding of how these processes create the diversity of planets observed in the galaxy.</p>
<p>The team obtained transmission spectra during four transits of WASP-39b, using three different instruments on JWST: NIRSpec (in two different observing modes), NIRISS, and NIRCam. This yielded transmission spectroscopy data covering the infrared wavelengths from 1 to 5 microns.</p>
<p>&#8220;The broad wavelength coverage provides a more complete picture of the conditions in the atmosphere,&#8221; Batalha said. &#8220;Moreover, each transit observation yields a planetary spectrum at distinct but overlapping wavelengths, allowing us to test the reproducibility of each instrument.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spectra from different instruments were consistent in the overlap regions. All the instruments performed at or above expectations, which is good news for astronomers planning future observations. That includes probing the atmospheres of smaller, rocky planets like those in the TRAPPIST-1 system.</p>

<p>With a mix of new construction and renovation, UC Santa Cruz is building more housing, constructing new classroom space, and ultimately strengthening the student experience.</p>
<p>California lawmakers awarded $89 million to UC Santa Cruz in the 2022-23 state budget, which enabled the campus to move forward with plans that would provide housing for nearly 990 undergraduates at Kresge, which is over 600 more beds than what the residential college originally held. Beginning in fall 2025, UC Santa Cruz will be able to offer lower cost housing rates to 320 students. Regents unanimously approved the new plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are steadfast in our commitment to student success, and housing is a critical component in providing access to a UC Santa Cruz education,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;I am so grateful to our state leaders for investing in our housing efforts. It will make a real difference in the lives of our students for decades to come.&#8221;<br/><br/>UC Regents first approved the renewal project in March 2019 and construction began later that year. The first phase, which includes new residential halls and a 35,000-square-foot academic center and plaza, is set to be finished in summer 2023. The Kresge Academic Center will have classrooms serving the entire campus and will include a 600-seat lecture hall, the largest on campus; a 150-seat lecture hall; 50- and 35-seat classrooms; a 48-seat computing lab; as well as departmental space. The new residential halls include a new cafe, which will be built close to the front of the Academic Plaza, and a pedestrian trail that will weave in and out of student community rooms on the ground floor.</p>
<p>In the second phase of the project, the iconic Kresge architecture will be reconstructed and renovated to retain the college&#8217;s historic design, only with more durable and resilient materials. UC Santa Cruz will renovate and add a third floor to seven of the 12 existing buildings for housing and construct a new housing building at the south end of the college. Most of the residential space in Phase 2 is designed as apartments and smaller residence hall rooms, with primarily double and triple occupancy and some singles.</p>
<p>The entire project including the second phase of construction that will begin in summer 2023 is expected to be finished in fall 2025.</p>
<h2>Supporting students from low-income backgrounds</h2>
<p>The $89 million in state funding is enabling UC Santa Cruz to build more much-needed housing and to also implement new lower-cost housing rates for undergraduate students.</p>
<p>Beginning in fall 2025, UC Santa Cruz will be able to offer 320 undergraduates rental rates that are about 20 percent below the average campus housing rate. The program will span all 10 residential colleges and will help UC Santa Cruz retain students and support them in achieving their educational goals.</p>
<p>With the goal of supporting educational equity, advancing diversity, and cultivating a sense of belonging, UC Santa Cruz will prioritize access to these units for Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) students including foster youth/former foster youth, current military/veterans, undocumented students (not qualifying for federal aid), first-generation students, low-income or low-socioeconomic-background students, those who experienced homelessness before UCSC, those formerly incarcerated or system-impacted, and others.</p>
<h2>Plans to build more student housing</h2>
<p>In the decade ahead, UC Santa Cruz plans to move forward on a bold plan that will continue to increase the amount of housing for current and future students. Campus leaders are implementing a multi-year housing plan that includes parallel planning pathways. This will allow UCSC to more quickly move on to another project if one is delayed and to regularly deliver beds to meet campus housing goals.</p>
<p>These plans build on the campus&#8217;s longstanding commitment to provide an on-campus residential experience for students. The campus currently provides housing for more than half of its undergraduates. While this is one of the highest percentages in the UC system, UC Santa Cruz leaders say it is not high enough. Campus efforts to build more on-campus housing continue in earnest.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, the campus has increased its student housing capacity by 3,300 beds through structural modifications, such as adding floors, major building redesigns and by increasing the density in residence halls.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9c1de2be807270463f9789cc5e10c132"><name>solidarity-with-colorado-springs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>In solidarity with Colorado Springs and our LGBTQ+ community members</title><summary>Vice Chancellors Akirah Bradley-Armstrong and Anju Reejhsinghani offer a message of support and solidarity in response to the tragic shooting in Colorado Springs.</summary><start-date>1669017600000</start-date><display-name>In solidarity with Colorado Springs and our LGBTQ+ community members</display-name><path>/2022/11/solidarity-with-colorado-springs</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/11/solidarity-with-colorado-springs</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1669066515101</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1669066668308</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>Dear UC Santa Cruz students, staff, and faculty, </span><br/><span>&#160; </span><br/><span>Our hearts are heavy as we grapple with the devastating news of Saturday&#8217;s senseless shooting at Club Q in Colorado Springs. The news that five people were murdered&#8211;and 25 more injured&#8211;in an LGTBTQ+ nightclub is agonizing. It is unbearable once again to realize that our everyday spaces of safety and joy can so quickly descend into those of terror and violence.

And that&#8217;s what we know. Tragically, many violent crimes committed against trans and nonbinary people go unreported. This latest act of hate violence, layered with the hate violence the LGBTQ+ communities have long endured, compounds our grief, increases our sorrow, and deepens our pain.&#160; </span><br/><span>&#160; </span><br/><span>As we grieve, we also acknowledge the very real fear, sadness, and loneliness many in our community may be feeling as a result of this weekend&#8217;s horrific shooting.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winner of Best Historical Documentary at the Toronto Documentary Film Festival this past July and Best Documentary Feature at the Lonely Seal International Film Festival in October, the film explores the racial inheritance of Japanese American family incarceration during World War II through multigenerational conversations with two survivors and their descendants, both of whom have Bay Area roots including Parre&#241;as Shimizu&#8217;s own father-in-law, Dr. Tadashi Robert Shimizu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the film, Parre&#241;as Shimizu employed a distinctive approach, gathering children and grandchildren around the two elders to explore, in conversation with one another, the impact that Executive Order 9066 has had on all of their lives&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the loss of their Japanese names, rituals, and language or the way trauma is passed on in the ability to express love</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The result is a moving and tender portrait of these families as they share memories both painful and joyous, reflect on the inheritance of their histories, and process these together to form a new understanding of themselves and one another.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This lens on multiple generations particularly struck Jonas Rivera, the multiple Oscar Award-winning Executive Vice President of Film Production at Pixar, who recently hosted a private screening of 80 YEARS LATER at Pixar&#8217;s studios on October 27 and joined Parre&#241;as Shimizu and Pixar Associate Producer Krissy Cababa for a Q &amp; A.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love your choice to interview someone, always flanked by other generations and family members, almost like they are listening with us,&#8221; commented Rivera, whose credits include </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside Out</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toy Story 4</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soul</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;The echo through generations in time is really powerful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This movie is so personal for me,&#8221; said Cababa, who is part Japanese and has worked on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coco</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brave</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luca</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is the producer of the SparkShorts series, and associate producer of the upcoming 2023 feature </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elemental</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;It&#8217;s a reminder about how important the human experience is and underscores how important it is to make sure that the art we are making and putting out into the world has an emotional core. There is a human behind every story. How do we create empathy and understanding and make people feel?&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rivera also reflected on the influence a movie like 80 YEARS LATER has on his work. &#8220;When I see your films, I think about moments of human authenticity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Even though we make animated films set in fantastic worlds, we want audiences to connect to people, so watching a film like this makes me think of the tools you need to do that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further screenings this year of 80 YEARS LATER are scheduled at the Las Vegas International Film Festival, Bangkok International Documentary Film Festival, Asian Film Festival in Los Angeles, and at the Culver City Film Festival where Parre&#241;as Shimizu&#8217;s film </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Celine Archive </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">won Grand Prize in 2021. The film will also screen next month in the Bay Area at the Silicon Valley International Film Festival.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">80 YEARS LATER has also been shown in K-12 public schools in St Louis, MO and Cincinnati, OH.</span></p>

Research and creative activities provide the opportunity to take classroom learning and put it into practice in real world settings using deeper intellectual inquiry to find solutions, create knowledge and new means of cultural creation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is creating more pathways into research, opening doors that take undergraduates into worlds they never knew existed,&#8221; Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer said. As a student-centered public institution with high-impact research, there are opportunities in every academic division across campus &#8211; arts, humanities, engineering, physical and biological sciences and social sciences. &#8220;These research and artistic endeavors benefit the undergraduates, faculty mentors, and the university.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidifying its commitment to increasing the diversity of its faculty, both underrepresented minorities and female faculty, last year, the University of California launched the </span><a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/growing-our-own-developing-faculty-reflects-california"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing Our Own initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It aims to equip students to apply to graduate school, continue their research in a UC doctoral and post-doctoral program and ultimately become UC faculty members. The goal is that by 2030, over 40 percent of UC PhDs will have come from a UC or CSU campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A partner in this vital work, UC Santa Cruz is increasing its outreach, encouraging more students to get involved in research &#8211; the sooner, the better, especially those who haven&#8217;t been exposed to research or the careers it can lead to. Research experience is a critical component in opening doors to career opportunities and to preparing undergraduates to apply to graduate school.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Coming to a place like UCSC enables you to do the type of research that actually gives you freedom, freedom to evolve into any direction that you come up with,&#8221; said Karlton Hester, a professor and composer in the Music Department, associate dean of diversity, equity and inclusion and director of the Digital Arts &amp; New Media.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Students constantly bring something new to the table, whether it&#8217;s enthusiasm or a new perspective or new ideas,&#8221; said Roxanne Beltran, assistant professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Student researchers in the Beltran Lab do fieldwork at A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve collecting data that helps monitor the demographics of the northern elephant seals. &#8220;The students&#8217; ideas really invigorate me, and we do much better science when we do it together,&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raquel Lozano, an undergraduate in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department, recently worked on a paper with Professor Beltran on the duration and timing of molt of the elephant seals. &#8220;I by no means come from a science background or a math background, but I now feel like a scientist.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having students work on the projects helps me see it with new eyes,&#8221; said Greg O&#8217;Malley, associate professor of history. &#8220;They bring new perspective. They ask questions that make me stop and rethink some of the assumptions behind the work.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some areas such as virtual reality, students are even ahead of their professors. &#8220;It&#8217;s great to work with undergraduate students because they&#8217;re very well informed about the newest games and the newest virtual reality technology,&#8221; said Professor Sri Kurniawan, in Baskin Engineering&#8217;s Computational Media Department.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I came in thinking that I was going to mainly do an educational track to become a teacher and I&#8217;m leaving actually wanting to do more research,&#8221; said history major Gavin Williams. &#8220;And how I came about that was really just asking the questions I wanted to know more about to my professors even if I didn&#8217;t really think they had to do with the class. But if I felt they had the knowledge, I just asked and then eventually I started wanting to find those answers myself.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students can also develop their own independent research project. Nancy Chen, professor of anthropology, directs the Global and Community Health Wellbeing Fellows program and sponsors undergraduates in their independent research projects. &#8220;The journey actually takes students to places they never expected,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Sometimes it might be graduate school, other times, a new career opportunity. And through this research or other projects, they find themselves prepared in amazing ways.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with growing their academic knowledge, students develop professional skills including time management, learning to work independently, problem-solving, and gaining self-confidence.&#160;</span></p>

With plans in motion to open OSSCE by Fall 2023, the division is currently conducting a nationwide search for the office&#8217;s first </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XMHYeSp-yTi5VU03tRDDYrk78ThW73rC3yEQcgfzMoA/edit?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Dean of Students and Director of Student Conduct and Conflict Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the general direction of the Associate Vice Chancellor and Dean of Students, the Associate Dean of Students and Director of Student Conduct and Conflict Education will manage and provide visionary leadership for the campus wide non-academic student conduct and conflict education systems. Responsibilities will include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing the long term organizational goals and strategic plans of the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Education</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directing supervisors and/or managers that report into the role</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overseeing program analysis and evaluation</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing the OSCCE budget and human resources </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representing OSCCE and the Dean of Students Office with external organizations</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formulating and developing policies </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educating the campus community about OSCCE programs</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serving as a resource and consultant to students, faculty, staff, and external constituencies</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Conduct and Conflict Education will serve as the campus office of record for non-academic student conduct and related files, maintaining confidential records, and ensuring institutional compliance and reporting. The incumbent will serve as the "responsible official" for specifically designated conduct cases, advise the AVC/DOS on a variety of complex policies and campus climate issues, serve as a member of the Dean of Students leadership team, and may act as operational backup to the AVC/DOS.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creation of OSSCE is a direct outcome of the student, staff, and faculty task force commissioned by Chancellor Larive in February 2021 to review UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s student conduct program. With equity at the forefront, the ultimate goal of this task force was to recommend newer, more just, equitable, and student-centered approaches in the administration of student conduct. The task force&#8217;s efforts spanned the 2021 winter and spring quarters and included a self study as well as an external review by noted experts in the field of student conduct and diversity, equity, and inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the task force&#8217;s recommendations, OSCCE will have two wings: 1.) student rights and responsibilities and 2.) conflict education and healing. Formal and informal adjudication will take place within the student rights and responsibilities wing while new positions are being created in conflict education and healing to both augment UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s restorative justice program and add and expand methods for resolving student conduct and conflict concerns. New and expanded methods could include shuttle diplomacy, conflict coaching, and educational interventions around alcohol and drug use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once fully established, DSAS projects approximately two-thirds of all student conduct referrals will be handled within the conflict education and healing wing while the most serious cases will be reserved for adjudication. This approach will reduce the number of disciplinary records created for less serious concerns. OSCCE also plans to develop an array of peer-facilitated programs staffed by paid student employees in both wings of the office.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, an advisory board of students, staff, and faculty will be established to partner with OSCCE and will serve as an institutionalized mechanism for providing regular guidance and recommendations regarding policies, processes, and practices. The Division of Student Affairs and Success will soon be in touch with the Academic Senate, Student Union Assembly, Graduate Student Association, and Staff Advisory Board to request nominations for this new advisory board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While recruitment for the Associate Dean of Students and Director of Student Conduct and Conflict Education represents the first hire for this newly minted office, it certainly will not be the last. The Division of Student Affairs and Success anticipates creating new positions in the coming months and will initiate recruitments for them accordingly.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial review date for the Associate Dean of Students and Director of Student Conduct and Conflict Education is November 30, 2022. Stay tuned for updates about finalists&#8217; on-campus interviews and how you can attend.

Batalha, professor astronomy and astrophysics and director of astrobiology at UC Santa Cruz and leader of the NASA </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/11/astrobiology-consortium.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interdisciplinary Consortium for Astrobiology Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, presented her team&#8217;s initial scientific findings from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to the </span><a href="https://science.house.gov/subcommittees/space-117th-congress"><span style="font-weight: 400;">space and aeronautics subcommittee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Nov. 16 during a hearing titled, &#8220;</span><a href="https://science.house.gov/hearings/unfolding-the-universe-initial-science-results-from-the-james-webb-space-telescope"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfolding the Universe: Initial science results from the James Webb Space Telescope</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of the congressional hearing was to receive expert testimony on the initial science and scientific findings of the JWST, as well as plans for future scientific investigations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz astronomers are involved in projects within each of the four main science themes JWST is studying (first stars and galaxies, galaxies over time, lifecycle of stars, and planetary systems). Batalha is leading a large international team who are studying planets around other stars (exoplanets), one of the most exciting areas in which JWST is expected to open new territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batalha described to the subcommittee how the JWST is ushering in a new era of exoplanet science. She noted that this progress is largely due to the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres as enabled by JWST technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a groundbreaking discovery earlier this year, Batalha and her team found </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/08/exoplanet-carbon-dioxide.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unambiguous evidence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of an exoplanet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The discovery demonstrated the power of the JWST to deliver unprecedented observations of exoplanet atmospheres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In research that was released today, Batalha and her team used the JWST to observe a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/11/exoplanet-spectra.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturn-mass planet called WASP-39b</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which orbits very close to a sun-like star about 700 light-years from Earth. They were able to identify multiple chemical species in the planet&#8217;s atmosphere, including sodium, potassium, water, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. They also detected sulfur dioxide, a molecule produced from chemical reactions triggered by high-energy light from the planet&#8217;s host star. Batalha explained that this type of chemistry, called photochemistry, is fundamental for life on Earth to thrive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spectrometers aboard the JWST allow scientists to measure the amount of light blocked at each wavelength, building up a &#8220;spectrum&#8221; that reveals the chemical makeup of a planet&#8217;s atmosphere. When a planet, in orbit around its host star, transits in front of the star, some of the starlight passes through the planet&#8217;s atmosphere on its way to Earth&#8217;s telescopes. The atoms and molecules in the atmosphere absorb the starlight at distinct wavelengths, effectively blocking slightly different fractions of light from reaching a telescope. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This method of studying planetary atmospheres is called transmission spectroscopy, and it has been employed by the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes on a small number of planets. The JWST is extending the capability and increasing the sensitivity of this method by collecting more light in a stable environment across a broader range of (infrared) wavelengths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about what she&#8217;s most excited to learn from the JWST, Batalha noted that the most common type of planet scientists know about is a type of planet that is not found in our solar system: an &#8220;intermediate&#8221; between rocky, terrestrial planets such as Earth or Mars, and gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. Scientists do not yet understand their nature or whether such planets can host life, but the JWST will be able to characterize and shed more light on this class of planets.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batalha concluded that transmission spectra, which &#8220;contain so many clues about the nature of the universe,&#8221; are &#8220;extremely compelling, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing more spectra so we can understand the diversity of all of the worlds that are out there.&#8221;</span></p>

Cerebral organoids allow researchers to study and engineer key functions of the human brain with a level of accuracy not possible with other models. This has implications for understanding brain development and the effects of pharmaceutical drugs for treating cancer or other diseases.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20096-9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span>published in the journal <i>Nature Scientific Reports</i>, researchers from the UCSC <a href="https://braingeneers.ucsc.edu/"><span class="s2">Braingeneers group</span></a> detail their automated, internet-connected microfluidics system, called &#8220;Autoculture.&#8221; The system precisely delivers feeding liquid to individual cerebral organoids in order to optimize their growth without the need for human interference with the tissue culture.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cerebral organoids require a high level of expertise and consistency to maintain the precise conditions for cell growth over weeks or months. Using an automated system, as demonstrated in this study, can eliminate disturbance to cell culture growth caused by human interference or error, provide more robust results, and allow more scientists access to opportunities to conduct research with human brain models.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Autoculture also addresses variation that arises in organoid growth due to &#8220;batch effect&#8221; issues, where organoids grown at different times or at different labs under similar conditions may vary just because of the complexity of their growth. Using this uniform, automated system can reduce variation and allow researchers to better compare and validate their results.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;One of the big challenges is that these cultures are not very reproducible, and in part it's not surprising because these are months-long experiments. You have to change media every couple of days and try to treat these cultures uniformly, which is extremely challenging,&#8221; said Sofie Salama, an acting professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at UCSC and an author on the study.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>

<figcaption>Twelve individual 12-day-old cerebral cortex cultures at day 1 of automated feeding.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Unique design</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Autoculture uses a microfluidic chip designed by the researchers, spearheaded by Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Mircea Teodorescu and Biomolecular Engineering Ph.D. student Spencer Seiler. Their novel chips, created from a unique bi-layer mold, have tiny wells and channels for delivering minute amounts of liquid to the organoid, which allow the scientists to have a high level of control over nutrient concentrations and byproducts. Overall, the system uses mostly off-the-shelf, low-cost components, making it accessible and modular.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;A novel and important feature of this machine is that on one hand, it streamlines the process and makes sure that everything is very consistent,&#8221; Teodorescu said. &#8220;On the other hand, it's very modular because the system is controlled by the computer, so there are different parts of the chip that are interchangeable and have their own advantages &#8211; it's very much a modern agent.&#8221;</span></p>

<figcaption>Associate Professor Mircea Teodorescu.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because the system delivers a non-stop flow of liquid to the organoids, it more closely resembles the real conditions of the brain, which is constantly fed nutrients through the blood.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unlike other methods for organoid growth which grow the cultures together in one dish, the Autoculture system contains a culture plate with 24 individual wells, so each well can be its own experiment in which cultures can be grown independently and fed liquids at varying, programmable concentrations and times. An in-incubator imaging system lets the researchers constantly remotely monitor organoid growth and morphology.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The prize of the system is that every organoid has its own, personal micro-environment for which fluid flows in and out of,&#8221; Seiler said. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ve separated them &#8211; this would be too laborious to do by hand, but it's fine for a machine.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p><span>On Sunday, smoke from the burns remained near ground level through the night due to weather conditions. At times during the night, the outdoor air quality index (AQI) rose above 150, a level at which some members of the general public may experience health effects when outside. You may still smell smoke inside buildings, but outdoor AQI levels throughout campus are now below 50. Buildings with HVAC systems are actively clearing indoor air and the amount of outdoor air entering buildings will be reduced where possible when burns begin again today.</span></p>
<p><span>The ignitions are scheduled to occur between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. All burning will depend on weather and air-quality conditions that are favorable for smoke dispersal. If the conditions are not conducive for burning, the burns will be rescheduled.</span></p>
<p><span>Some trails will be closed temporarily to ensure public safety, including portions of the Englesmann Loop, Eucalyptus Loop, Old Cabin and Long Meadow Trail.&#160; Everyone is advised to keep clear of the designated zone during the scheduled burn. Smoke may be noticed in the area for one to two days after the burn.</span></p>
<p><span>This burn is part of the prescribed fire program for vegetation management, hazardous fuel-load reduction, wildlife-habitat improvement, and other ecological benefits.The treatment will enhance the health of the forest by removing duff, leaf litter and fuel buildup and restore essential nutrients to the soil and reduce the chance of wildfires.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>WHAT TO DO:</strong></span><span> If you are affected by air-quality issues, stay indoors or leave the immediate area. Close windows until the burn has concluded. You can find information on the Air Quality Index (AQI) and local air-monitoring resources through </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/environmental/air-quality.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1669752597285000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ISQVxKGrIBWcH3ON4nn6S" href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/environmental/air-quality.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>EH&amp;S</span></a></span><span> and many weather apps.

<p><span><strong>REDUCE EXPOSURE:</strong></span><span> If the AQI is in the unhealthy, very unhealthy, or hazardous ranges, limit your outdoor activities and stay inside with the windows and doors closed, or if possible, leave the area. Drink plenty of fluids to keep your airway moist and easier to clear. If you are feeling ill due to poor air quality, seek advice from your medical provider.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long before Irene Vasquez (Merrill &#8217;09, environmental studies and economics) began her education at UC Santa Cruz, she was already well aware of her end-goal: a restoration of Native health, spirit, practices, and medicine in her homeland of Yosemite.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vasquez has worked towards her current position as the first Cultural Ecologist at Yosemite since she was a child. Growing up in the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation, Vasquez recalls many traditions passed onto her by her elders that she would go on to share during her time as a Cultural Demonstrator at the Indian Cultural Museum in Yosemite.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She now serves as a Cultural Ecologist at Yosemite, where she seeks to preserve and assist with restoring tribal stewardship of the national park&#8217;s seven affiliated tribal nations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My role now is to help restore that connection between people, those reciprocal relationships, and to allow for our generational knowledge to continue,&#8221; Vasquez says. &#8220;I have this real understanding from growing up in Yosemite ceremonies that we are a part of our nature, and we have a responsibility to take care of our homes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vasquez promotes the importance of inclusive science and participatory research&#8212;making sure that the people who live on the land are also the ones who manage it. Over time, Vasquez says the park services at Yosemite pivoted from relying on local knowledge from those who lived on the land, to hiring from across the country and prioritizing those with degrees.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for a degree to work in Yosemite was a driving force for Vasquez&#8217;s choice to attend UC Santa Cruz, where she could gain an education in environmental studies&#8212;earning a degree that she could use to help restore her tribe&#8217;s position and fulfill what she sees as &#8220;a responsibility to take care of our homes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There were more native people, more of my relatives who used to work in Yosemite for the park service. But now, because of different hiring practices, it's national and set towards people with degrees, which not many Native people have. &#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting involved with the Student Alliance of North American Indians (SANAI), was another reason Vasquez chose UCSC. She participated in the group throughout her time on campus. UCSC provided a space where Vasquez could work towards the education she sought, find both a community and support network at SANAI, and live surrounded by nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people of the Southern Sierra Miwuk Tribe have lived in Yosemite for generations, and Vasquez wants to make sure that they and the other affiliated tribes have a say in both the management and restoration of the land they call home.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My big goals are to help spread awareness and educate the general public about the importance of inclusive science and participatory research,&#8221; she says. &#8220;This means involving tribal stewards and tribal people, who are local. Still today, our native cultures and native people rely on native plant species and native species in general for cultural conditioning, and for traditions to continue.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vasquez is also working towards her tribe&#8217;s long term goals&#8212;federal recognition. As part of this recognition, Vasquez hopes to make free UC tuition an option for her tribe&#8217;s future students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even though the UC systems have allowed Native students to have free tuition, it's only available for federally recognized tribes,&#8221; Vasquez said. &#8220;My tribe, the Southern Sierra Miwuk nation, are still going through this process of recognition, and we submitted our petition in 1982.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Longer than I've been alive, we've been working towards this goal of becoming fairly recognized not only for future generations, but for my Grandma, who's still alive, who deserves that recognition too,&#8221; Vasquez said. &#8220;There's still more work to do.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c0a00a5e807270460cc39a58e82f87b1"><name>get-virtual-coursera-feature-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC’s popular GetVirtual internship program expands its impact and outreach with newly launched Coursera course</title><summary>The brand-new Coursera GetVirtual course is an important addition to a popular program that partners student teams with local businesses while teaching students how to do consulting professionally &#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Coursera course is open to everyone around the world with an internet connection, regardless of academic affiliation. For learners outside the UC system it's free, unless they want a certificate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All along, GetVirtual has had the goal of sharing our process and resources with the world as a way of empowerment,&#8221; said GetVirtual&#8217;s co-founder Nada Miljkovi&#263;, a continuing lecturer at UCSC who has been teaching most of the offerings of Crown 95 and has since become project manager for the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development (CIED).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now, with the launching of the Coursera course, our dream is coming true,&#8221; said Miljkovi&#263;, who is also a broadcaster, entrepreneur and multimedia artist.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Students can be anyone from those about to graduate to young professionals wanting to go out on their own to retirees wanting to continue having a purpose in life,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miljkovi&#263; emphasized that the Coursera version will be held in addition to the GetVirtual course, which will continue on campus as usual.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miljkovi&#263; co-founded GetVirtual two years ago with entrepreneur Toby Corey. They launched the course with the help of nine highly motivated UCSC students who became GetVirtual&#8217;s first student board of directors. Crown 95 has been offered every quarter since the spring of 2020, including summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The GetVirtual program is doing so well that we are at capacity with the students that are taking the class,&#8221; Miljkovi&#263; said. &#8220;Coursera gives us the ability to train outside of class with no additional resources.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization GetVirtual has also been extremely successful, completing more than 150 client projects with 70% of those businesses residing in the city of Santa Cruz, all at no cost to the clients.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz Works, a non-profit organization that aims to connect industry professionals and grow the number of locally founded startups, honored Miljkovi&#263; as one of its 2022 Titans of Tech for contributing to the growth of the local tech and entrepreneurial community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>An empowering program</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four-week Coursera/GetVirtual course has a unique structure and format. Students lead the discussions. The course also includes assignments, quizzes, self-assessments, templates, and many videos.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The first part of the course is about self-discovery of skills and values, learning about the entrepreneurial mindset and leadership styles,&#8221; Miljkovi&#263; said. &#8220;The second part takes what you learned about yourself to build an &#8216;about me&#8217; page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third part is learning the GetVirtual process. Students learn how to project manage, while learning the essentials of starting a company. &#8220;They learn the mechanics of it, figuring out what business structure they need,&#8221; Miljkovi&#263; said.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The structure and format makes this course &#8220;enormously empowering&#8221; for students, Miljkovi&#263; said. The main difference between the old GetVirtual course and the new Coursera version is student independence. There is no designated instructor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the original GetVirtual class, students are paired with local businesses to help redesign their websites for e-commerce, product delivery services, curbside pickup, and other features that can help them stay afloat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Coursera version, rather than partnering with businesses, students are their own clients by going through the process of discovery. They build a website for themselves. This version of the course is more like an ideas laboratory and intensive training seminar to prepare students for their entrepreneurial consulting roles, while going through the process of establishing a business step by step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That flexible format allows the students to pursue their interests, challenge one another, and develop business savvy as they learn from their peers. There is an element of role playing, as students develop their business plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of the website creation curriculum comes directly from Wix, the no-code website building platform and GetVirtual partner from its inception. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This GetVirtual/Coursera course is a good example of how our educational programs are becoming available to broader audiences," said Manel Camps, UCSC Professor of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology, Crown College Provost, and faculty director of the Center of Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development (CIED)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Camps noted that the Coursera format can also provide necessary training and structure for educators interested in setting up an organization similar to GetVirtual or a chapter of GetVirtual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GetVirtual has already expanded onto four other campuses and established partnerships with the city of Santa Cruz and with Santa Cruz&#8217;s Small Business Development Center.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GetVirtual team is now working on a Spanish version of the course, Miljkovi&#263; said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eventually, I want to see it translated to Serbo-Croatian, the language of the country where I&#8217;m from, as well as Portuguese, Punjabi, you name it," she said. &#8220;I want it to be available all over the world."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cid Pearlman, who is stewarding Online Education's open access offerings, praised Miljkovi&#263;&#8217;s work on the GetVirtual Coursera project.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nada has created a number of successful online courses with UCSC Online Education, bringing a wealth of experience as an educator and entrepreneur to everything she does,&#8221; Pearlman said. &#8220;This open access version of GetVirtual gives learners across the globe the privilege to access this information and launch their own virtual businesses. We look forward to following the accomplishments of the Coursera students.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c0d64bf8807270460cc39a58b0b4353f"><name>police-chief</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Recruitment for campus police chief underway</title><summary>Initial screening interviews of highly qualified candidates will take place via Zoom in the coming weeks, and the top ranked candidates from those interviews will be invited for on campus visits and additional interviews. </summary><start-date>1669622400000</start-date><display-name>Police chief</display-name><path>/2022/11/police-chief</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/11/police-chief</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1669682580453</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1669682580453</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The search for a new chief of police to lead the UCSC police department is underway.</p>

Introns are segments of noncoding DNA that must be removed from the genetic code before it is translated in the process of making proteins. Introns are an ancient feature found across all eukaryotic life, a wide range of organisms that spans all animals, plants, fungi, and protists, but are absent in prokaryotic genomes such as those of bacteria. There is a massive variation in the number of introns found in different species&#8217; genomes, even between closely related species.<br/><br/>Now, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2209766119"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led</span> by scientists at UC Santa Cruz and published in the journal <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> (PNAS) points to introners, one of several proposed mechanisms for the creation of introns discovered in 2009, as an explanation for the origins of most introns across species. The researchers believe that introners are the only likely explanation for intron burst events, in which thousands of introns show up in a genome seemingly all at once, and they find evidence of this in species across the tree of life.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;[This study] provides a plausible explanation for the vast majority of origins of introns,&#8221; said Russell Corbett-Detig, associate professor of biomolecular engineering and senior author on the study. &#8220;There's other mechanisms out there, but this is the only one that I know of that could generate thousands and thousands of introns all at once in the genome. If true, this suggests that we've uncovered a core process driving something that's really special about eukaryotic genomes &#8211; we have these introns, we have genomic complexity.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>Introns are important because they allow for alternative splicing, which in turn allows one gene to code for multiple transcripts and therefore serve multiple complex cellular functions. Introns can also affect gene expression, the rate at which genes get turned on to make proteins and other non-coding RNA. Introns ultimately have a neutral to slightly negative effect on the species they exist in because when the splicing of introns is not carried out correctly, the gene they live in can be harmed and even die. Such missed splicing instances are the cause of some cancers.<br/><br/>Corbett-Detig and his colleagues searched the genomes of 3,325 eukaryotic species &#8211; all of the species for which we have access to high-quality reference genomes &#8211; to find out how common introner-derived introns are, and in which groups of species they are seen most frequently. They found a total of 27,563 introner-derived introns in the genomes of 175 species, meaning evidence of introners could be seen in 5.2% of surveyed species.&#160;<br/><br/>This evidence was found in species of all types, from animals to single-cell protists &#8211; organisms whose last common ancestor lived over 1.7 billion years ago. The diversity of species in which they are found suggests introners are both the fundamental and most widespread source of introns across the tree of life.<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s diverse &#8211; it isn't like there's one little chunk of the tree of life that has this going on,&#8221; Corbett-Detig said. &#8220;You see this in a pretty big range of species, which suggests it's a pretty general mechanism.&#8221;<br/><br/>This analysis can only detect evidence of introners going back some millions of years, a relatively short time span when it comes to evolutionary history. It&#8217;s likely that intron bursts could have occurred in some species, such as humans, at a time beyond the scope of this analysis &#8211; meaning this study probably vastly underestimates the true scope of introner-dervied introns across all eukaryotes.<br/><br/><strong>Introners as genomic parasites</strong>&#160;<br/><br/>In the ecosystem of the genome, introners can be thought of as a parasite with the goal to survive and replicate itself. When an introner enters a new organism, that new host has never seen that element before and has no way to defend itself, allowing it to proliferate in a new species.<br/><br/>&#8220;Everything in evolution is a conflict and these elements, [including introners], are selfish pieces of DNA,&#8221; said Landen Gozashti, the paper&#8217;s first author who developed the study&#8217;s analysis methods as an undergraduate at UCSC and is now a graduate student at Harvard University. &#8220;They only want to replicate, and the only reason they don't want to kill their host is because that kills them.&#8221;<br/><br/>In being spliced out of the DNA sequence before translation of the gene into proteins occurs, the introners found a way to have less impact on the fitness of the host gene, allowing them to persist through the generations of the host species&#8217; evolution. The researchers found that introners-derived introns seem to splice better than other types of introns, to limit their negative effects on the gene so that both the introner and the host can better survive.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>More introners in the sea</strong><br/><br/>While all introners were found across all types of species, results showed that marine organisms were 6.5 times more likely to have introners than land species.&#160;<br/><br/>The researchers think this is likely due to a phenomena called horizontal gene transfer, in which genes transfer from one species to a different one, as opposed to the typical vertical transfer via mating and the passing of genes from parent to child. Horizontal gene transfer has already been known to occur more commonly in marine environments, especially between single-cell species with complex ecologies.<br/><br/>Introners can travel this way because they belong to a class of genomic elements called transposable elements, which have the ability to move beyond the cell environment in which they live, making them mechanistically well-equipped to travel between species via horizontal gene transfer. As introners transferred from one species to another in marine environments, they vastly expanded their presence across the tree of life.&#160;<br/><br/>Considering we know that all species evolved from marine organisms, it could have been that land species gained introns from intron bursts far back in their evolutionary history.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;If your ancestors were marine organisms, which they all were, there's a good chance that a lot of your introns are sort of inherited from a similar [introner burst] event back then,&#8221; Corbett-Detig said. &#8220;This might have been very important in our evolutionary past.&#8221;<br/><br/>More introners were also found across fungal species, which are also known to have higher rates of horizontal gene transfer, further supporting the idea that this phenomena drives itroner gain.&#160;<br/><br/>In future research, Corbett-Detig plans to look for proof of horizontal gene transfer in the form of nearly identical introners in two different species. He has set up data mining pipelines so that as the global community of genomics researchers contribute new species&#8217; genomes to data repositories, his algorithm will search each new genome&#8217;s introners and compare it to all of the known introners to look for similarities.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Understanding how complexity evolves</strong>&#160;<br/><br/>This study presents a challenge to one of the overarching theories of genome evolution as to what drives genomic complexity in eukaryotes. The theory also posits that at a point in evolution, many species had low effective population sizes, meaning very few organisms in a species were producing offspring to create their next generation. This allowed elements known to have slightly negative effects on the population to accumulate in the genome.&#160;<br/><br/>Following this theory, itroners, which are neutral to slightly deleterious, would be seen more commonly in populations with lower effective populations &#8211; but the researchers found the opposite. For example, they found that Symbiodinium, a protist known to have a much higher effective population size than humans, land plants, and other invertebrates, is the species that seems to be gaining the most introns of those surveyed.&#160;<br/><br/>But this research points toward complexity arising not from an adaptation created by the genome itself but as a response to conflict caused by the invading transposable element, the introner, as it tries to proliferate. As introners and other elements struggle to survive and persist, this conflict drives genome complexity.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Introners and gene expression</strong><br/><br/>The neutral to negative effects of introns are also evidenced by their effect on gene expression. When comparing genes with introners inserted into them to genes without, those that do have introners had a lower overall expression level, meaning they are turned on less often to perform functions in the body.<br/><br/>The researchers believe that introners are not necessarily directly causing this lower expression, but that genes that are expressed less have a higher tolerance for an element that may be affecting them negatively because they matter less for the species survival. Meanwhile, genes that are highly expressed and may be coding for key functions in the body likely can&#8217;t tolerate the introduction of new introns that could cause them to perform their task less effectively.&#160;<br/><br/>Corbett-Detig&#8217;s ongoing research on this topic also involves looking at direct evidence of how the appearance of introns in a genome affects individuals within a species. He has identified several species that are experiencing ongoing intron bursts and is looking at the effect of introners on the DNA and RNA of the cell, and how this affects the species&#8217; evolutionary fitness.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c4da971e807270460cc39a58035c98b6"><name>new-associate-deans-humanities-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Humanities Division welcomes two new associate deans </title><summary>Literature professor and Creative Writing Program director Micah Perks and associate professor of Feminist Studies Gina Dent began work as associate Humanities deans in September.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Literature professor and Creative Writing Program director Micah Perks is the new associate dean of faculty affairs. Associate Professor of Feminist Studies Gina Dent is the inaugural associate dean of diversity, equity, and inclusion for the Humanities Division. Both started their new positions on September 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous dean of faculty affairs was Kimberly Lau, literature professor at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am grateful to Kim Lau for her tremendous contributions over the last year in her role as associate dean of faculty affairs, and am thrilled to work with Micah and Gina this year,&#8221; Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micah Perks (MFA, Cornell University) has served as Kresge College co-provost, sat on the Committee on Educational Policy and the Committee for Affirmative Action and Diversity, twice chaired the Committee on Committees and vice-chaired the&#160; system-wide Committee on Committees.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perks is the author of two novels, a short story collection, a memoir and many essays.&#160; Her awards include an Independent Publishers</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gold Medal, a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, a Saltonstall Foundation for the Arts Fellowship, the New Guard Machigonne Short Story Prize, and fellowships at MacDowell and Blue Mountain Center. Her most recent novel was included in The Top Ten Books about</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the Apocalypse by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guardian</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She is working on a speculative novel, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wood Between the Worlds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perks is excited to begin this new position.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m very interested in the position&#8217;s focus on climate and mentoring, recruitment and retention,&#8221; Perks said. &#8220;In my roles as Kresge College provost, director of Creative Writing, and chair of the Committee on Committees for the Academic Senate, I have worked energetically and passionately on these issues, particularly with regard to diversity, equity and inclusion. In all my roles at UCSC, my desire has been to create communities that get things done, to listen with respect and compassion, and for us all to have as much fun as possible in the process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gina Dent (Ph.D., English &amp; Comparative Literature, Columbia University) is Associate Professor of Feminist Studies, History of Consciousness, and Legal Studies. She received the Dizikes Faculty Teaching Award in the Humanities in 2019 and the Chancellor&#8217;s Achievement Award for Diversity in 2007. Dent has served on six Senate committees and has chaired four of them, including the Committee on Affirmative Action and Diversity [CAAD]. Dent conducted the campus&#8217; first climate study of diversity, co-sponsored by the Chancellor&#8217;s Office and CAAD, and served as the inaugural Senate Equity Advocate (2021-22).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m hoping to help build on some of the positive changes that are already being made in the division, thinking about identity taxation, rewarding various scholarly modalities including public-facing work, and encouraging the development of Critical Race and Ethnic Studies,&#8221; Dent said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I tend to work with, but also by challenging, conventional DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) frameworks,&#8221; Dent continued. &#8220;Meaningful transformation needs to be culture-shifting and community building, and requires a nuanced understanding of difference and support of those differences beyond state-protected categories and generalized understandings of race and gender.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This year, I hope to work with each unit [in the division] on some of the difficulties&#8212;retention, recruitment, equitable distribution of labor&#8212;as well as assist in honing a forward-thinking vision that supports all of our members&#8212;faculty, staff, and students,&#8221; Dent said. &#8220;I am particularly interested in building an intellectual community that enhances staff participation and supports their development.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dent has a decades-long relationship to the UC President&#8217;s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program and served as the chair of the Advisory Committee and UCSC campus representative, as well as chair (or co-chair) of the program&#8217;s Arts &amp; Humanities review panel. Currently, she is PI and co-director of the </span><a href="https://visualizingabolition.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visualizing Abolition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project and Faculty Fellow at the UCSC Institute of the Arts and Sciences. She is the editor of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Popular Culture </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">([1993] New York: The New Press, 1998) and co-author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abolition. Feminism. Now. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Haymarket Books, 2022).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the Humanities division, we value advocacy for students,&#160; teaching excellence,&#160; and mentorship,&#8221; Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder said. &#8220;Research innovation, equity, and growing a diverse faculty are equally important. Our new associate deans Micah Perks and Gina Dent will help us continue to attract and retain outstanding faculty and foster a strong sense of community in the Humanities division.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to these two new associate deans, the Humanities division has named UCSC literature professor Sharon Kinoshita as interim associate dean of research and faculty director of the Humanities Institute. &#8220;I am working to continue to support and showcase the innovative research of our faculty and graduate and undergraduate students,&#8221; Kinoshita said.&#160;</span></p>

<p>The survey, created by faculty who developed the course in collaboration with Institutional Research, Assessment, and Policy Studies, reported significant increases in self-efficacy in students, both first-generation and continuing-gen, in areas of academic literacy including abilities to find campus resources, selecting courses, time management, and ability to interact with peers, instructors, and staff. The report also revealed a 55% increase in incoming students&#8217; self-efficacy in finding campus resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly all (93&#8211;94%) students reported improvement in their ability to find campus resources and plan which courses to take,&#8221; according to the report. &#8220;In addition, many student subgroups who started off with stronger concerns about not belonging at UCSC,&#8221; ended up feeling a similar &#8220;strong sense of belonging by the end of College 1A.&#8221;</p>
<p>The survey indicates that the change has &#8220;provide(d) important support to students not only in course learning outcomes (learning strategies for academic success, developing competency with campus tools for enrollment and path to degree, etc.), but also in developing a sense of belonging to their college and to UCSC broadly!&#8221;</p>
<p>College 1A &#8220;Introduction to University Life and Learning,&#8221; a required online and credit-bearing orientation course for all incoming UCSC first-years, launched in summer 2021. Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education Richard Hughey said the goal was to orient students to campus and to university life, while promoting community-building and effective habits of mind for academic success.</p>
<p>While offering these strategies, College 1A was designed to introduce students to core elements of academic literacy and to familiarize them with campus resources related to academic planning, health, and well-being.</p>
<p>The initiative, led by Orientation Director Rosa Plaza, shifted summer orientation to an online format, which proved effective in increasing knowledge delivery and retention by spreading the material over the entire summer; improving effectiveness while simultaneously reducing workload; and moving orientation into the digital era.</p>
<p>The change to an online format also supported more equitable access because some families no longer needed to decide between the high cost and lost wages of a multi-day trip to Santa Cruz, or a 4 a.m. to 11 p.m. day trip north. Although not planned, the 2019 shift to online summer orientation positioned our campus well to face challenges brought on by the pandemic.</p>
<p>While serving as Kresge College Provost, Ben Leeds Carson helped to lead the designing 1A as an academic course and handled the submission of the design by all 10 colleges for Senate approval. He also supervised the first iteration of the course in summer 2021.</p>
<p>Carson coordinated 15 faculty teaching 14 courses, including a version of the course for transfer students, which Carson helped design in collaboration with faculty affiliated with Services for Transfer and Re-Entry Students (STARS). &#8220;The way we centered justice and accessibility issues for a wide range of students facing barriers to entry&#8221; is, per Carson, important because &#8220;it&#8217;s a record of what we have to be accountable to in the future.&#8221; That legacy, he says, &#8220;is part of what holds future instructors accountable to uphold that vision and those purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Kresge 1A, incoming students are oriented toward resources that &#8220;support health and well-being, time management, strategies for academic success, the cultivation of just communities, the prevention of sexual harassment and violence, campus conduct policies, awareness of risks associated with alcohol and other drug use, reflection on UC Santa Cruz Principles of Community, and an introduction to the living and learning tradition of Kresge College,&#8221; the syllabus explains.</p>
<p>Juliana Leslie, an instructor who taught 1T for transfer students for the last two years, hopes to continue to work on the curriculum to make it &#8220;even more relevant to the transfer student experience.&#8221; For first-year students, she adds that it grants &#8220;a preview of the academic literacy curriculum and allows them to reflect on their learning habits and goals,&#8221; an optimal path to starting fall quarter. &#8220;Although faculty teaching the courses are still revising and fine-turning the curriculum and trying to make it as useful and valuable as possible for incoming students,&#8221; adds Leslie, &#8220;I think the course offers students an opportunity to connect with a faculty member, learn about campus resources, practice navigating canvas and other campus websites, and start to build community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Council of Provosts Chair Sean Keilen also looks forward to further evolution of College 1A. Revisions to the course by the Council of Provosts and Campus orientation &#8220;will allow us to make more progress toward empowering new students to turn this large, public university into a small neighborhood where they can get to know each other, learn how things work, and find the resources they need to achieve their goals,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Very high numbers of students reported developing a sense of self-efficacy and belonging as a result of completing College 1A.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zac Nakamura, a third-year Games and Playable Media major affiliated with Kresge, witnessed this firsthand as a Peer Navigator for Kresge 1A. &#8220;Not only did the course allow students to adjust to college-level discourse and discussion,&#8221; he says, &#8220;it allowed students to learn from the perspectives of their new fellow classmates.&#8221; Nakamura facilitated open discussions with the students and his co-Peer Navigators and found that &#8220;students' nerves and anxieties about college were eased,&#8221; citing that &#8220;the course allowed them to come together in a space where they could be vulnerable with each other&#8212;everything from nerves about college-level reading to not feeling prepared in general. These discussions gave incoming students the confidence that they are not alone, and that they can succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nakamura&#8217;s hopes for the future of College 1A are &#8220;that the course can bring the perspectives of other students, professors, and individuals who can share their experiences with finding success in college to the students,&#8221; he says. For the incoming students, hearing these various perspectives of how others have navigated the &#8220;pursuit of academic success&#8221; will be &#8220;the most beneficial tool they can have as they start this new chapter of their life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hughey also reflected on the past while envisioning the course&#8217;s evolution for 2023.</p>
<p>&#8220;This work has already begun,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will be fascinating to see this course, and our students, grow and develop based on this Survey Report and future assessments.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cfb28869807270466994f00b4380fd60"><name>exceptions-to-closure</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Exceptions to campus closure 2022-2023</title><summary>This year the campus will be closed from Friday, December 23, 2022 through Monday, January 2, 2023, re-opening on Tuesday, January 3, 2023. </summary><start-date>1669881600000</start-date><display-name>Exceptions to campus closure 2022-2023</display-name><path>/2022/11/exceptions-to-closure</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/11/exceptions-to-closure</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1669931894869</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1669931894869</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>As in the past, the UC Santa Cruz campus will close during the holiday season in an effort to conserve energy at a time when the university business is generally slow. This year the campus will be closed from Friday, December 23, 2022 through Monday, January 2, 2023, re-opening on Tuesday, January 3, 2023. The campus community is reminded to turn off lights, shut down computers and other office equipment, and close and lock exterior windows before leaving for the break.</span></p>
<p><span>During the closure some housing areas and other buildings will remain open. Laboratory buildings will be partially operational due to special needs of researchers and scientists, and some campus units' work schedules may require staffing during all or part of the closure. Fire, police, and environmental health and safety services will be provided to</span> <span>the campus community during this period, along with necessary utilities and other essential services.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are required to work all or part of this closure on campus, you must receive approval from your unit head and principal officer. Once unit heads have concurrence from their principal officer, they are asked to notify Physical Plant directly of their plans to remain open or staffed during part or all of the closure on campus. Notifications should be made via email to <a href="mailto:allysonr@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">allysonr@ucsc.edu</a> no later than Friday, December 9, 2022, and should include the specific dates that offices will be occupied, as well as the number of occupants. This will ensure that open areas will receive necessary services during this period when most faculty, staff, and students are gone.</span></p>
<p><span>It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time. Faculty is urged to announce the closure broadly to their graduate students who may plan on working throughout the closures.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have facilities-related questions or would like further information on campus closure exceptions, please contact Allyson Raedeke at (831) 515-9483.</span></p>
