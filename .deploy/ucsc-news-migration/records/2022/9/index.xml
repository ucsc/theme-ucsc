The planet is a gas giant, meaning it has no rocky surface and could not be habitable.</p>
<p>The image, as seen through four different light filters, shows how Webb&#8217;s powerful infrared gaze can easily capture worlds beyond our solar system, pointing the way to future observations that will reveal more information than ever before about exoplanets.</p>
<p>Aarynn Carter, a postdoctoral scholar working with Astronomy Professor Andrew Skemer at UC Santa Cruz, led the analysis of the image data.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve spent the last five years preparing for these observations, and seeing them not only succeed, but exceed expectations is exhilarating,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;I think what&#8217;s most exciting is that we&#8217;ve only just begun. There are many more images of exoplanets to come that will shape our overall understanding of their physics, chemistry, and formation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sasha Hinkley, associate professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, led these observations with a large international collaboration, including Skemer, who is a co-principal investigator of the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a transformative moment, not only for Webb but also for astronomy generally,&#8221; Hinkley said.</p>
<p>The exoplanet in Webb&#8217;s image, called HIP65426 b, is about six to eight times the mass of Jupiter. It is young as planets go&#8212;about 15 to 20 million years old, compared to our 4.5-billion-year-old Earth.</p>
<p>Astronomers discovered the planet in 2017 using the SPHERE instrument on the European Southern Observatory&#8217;s Very Large Telescope in Chile, and took images of it using short infrared wavelengths of light. The Webb image, taken in mid-infrared light, reveals new details that ground-based telescopes would not be able to detect because of the intrinsic infrared glow of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>Researchers have been analyzing the data from these observations and are preparing a paper they will submit to journals for peer review. But Webb's first capture of an exoplanet already hints at future possibilities for studying distant worlds.</p>
<p>Since HIP 65426 b is about 100 times farther from its host star than Earth is from the sun, it is sufficiently distant from the star that Webb can easily separate the planet from the star in the image.</p>
<p>Webb&#8217;s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) are both equipped with coronagraphs, which are sets of tiny masks that block out starlight, enabling Webb to take direct images of certain exoplanets like this one.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was really impressive how well the Webb coronagraphs worked to suppress the light of the host star,&#8221; Hinkley said.</p>
<p>Taking direct images of exoplanets is challenging because stars are so much brighter than planets. The HIP 65426 b planet is more than 10,000 times fainter than its host star in the near-infrared, and a few thousand times fainter in the mid-infrared. In each filter image, the planet appears as a slightly differently shaped blob of light. That is because of the particulars of Webb&#8217;s optical system and how it translates light through the different optics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obtaining this image felt like digging for space treasure,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;At first all I could see was light from the star, but with careful image processing I was able to remove that light and uncover the planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>While this is not the first direct image of an exoplanet taken from space&#8212;the Hubble Space Telescope has captured direct exoplanet images previously&#8212;HIP 65426 b points the way forward for Webb&#8217;s exoplanet exploration.</p>
<p>In addition to Carter and Skemer, other UC Santa Cruz astronomers involved in this work include Brittany Miles, Jonathan Fortney, Bruce Macintosh, Sagnick Mukherjee, and Callie Hood, as well as Xi Xhang in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences.</p>

<p>I write to announce that the temporary process announced in fall 2021 whereby a faculty member could request to teach their courses remotely based on their having an immunocompromised household member is being extended through fall quarter 2022.</p>
<p>In proceeding with all in-person instruction with Senate-approved online or hybrid for fall quarter, we realize now that it was not clear that we would no longer be supporting remote instruction for those instructors with an immunocompromised household member. Because it requires time and planning for these instructors to teach online or hybrid with Senate approval, we are permitting one final quarter for transition in fall 2022. Instructors (and TAs) with an immunocompromised household member may request a workplace adjustment to teach remotely in the fall by submitting documentation from the household member&#8217;s medical provider certifying that they are moderately to seriously immunocompromised such that they are at heightened risk of serious illness or death in the event of COVID infection. This documentation should not include information about specific diagnoses, and should be submitted directly to Danny Gray in APO ( dggray@ucsc.edu ), along with a note from the faculty member&#8217;s department or course sponsoring agency chair indicating whether they believe the learning outcomes of the course can be successfully achieved in a remote modality.</p>
<p>Fall 2022 will be the final quarter of remote instruction based on the immunocompromised status of a household member. In the subsequent quarters, instructors will be expected to teach their courses in-person or to be teaching Senate-approved online classes. Those instructors wanting to teach online should consult with the chair of their department or course sponsoring agency, and with the approval of the chair, will need to seek Senate approval for online instruction. Their proposal will be considered based on the Senate&#8217;s current criteria, which focus on pedagogy and achievement of student learning outcomes. An immunocompromised household member will not be considered as a criterion for online instruction. Please note that for winter 2023 courses, proposals are due to the course sponsoring agency chair by October 5, 2022.</p>
<p>Please note that instructors (and TAs) with their own disabling medical condition may continue indefinitely to seek accommodations through the reasonable accommodation process described in APM 711, where online instruction may be considered as a possible reasonable accommodation through the interactive process.</p>
<p>I greatly appreciate all the work that you as instructors have done throughout the pandemic, and I look forward to an engaging and productive fall quarter for us all.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lori Kletzer <br/>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fb71f20e807270465a2acc6a089ca1d8"><name>rippled-sheets</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New study confirms ‘rippled sheet’ protein structure predicted in 1953</title><summary>UCSC scientists reported three crystal structures of periodic rippled beta sheets, a novel protein structure with potential applications in biomedicine and materials science.</summary><keywords>Jevgenij Raskatov</keywords><start-date>1662102000000</start-date><display-name>New study confirms ‘rippled sheet’ protein structure predicted in 1953</display-name><path>/2022/09/rippled-sheets</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/09/rippled-sheets</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1662075924984</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1665608020536</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/cover-image-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/cover-image-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-image-400.jpg</name><display-name>cover-image-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>135230</file-size><width>400</width><height>514</height></image><image-alt>cover image, Chemical Science journal</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/cover-image-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/cover-image-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-image-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cover-image-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24231</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>journal cover image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>UCSC scientists reported three crystal structures of periodic rippled beta sheets, a novel protein structure with potential applications in biomedicine and materials science</article-subhead><article-text><p>An unusual protein structure known as a &#8220;rippled beta sheet,&#8221; first predicted in 1953, has now been created in the laboratory and characterized in detail using x-ray crystallography.</p>
<p>The new findings, <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/SC/D2SC02531K">published in July in <em>Chemical Science</em></a>, may enable the rational design of unique materials based on the rippled sheet architecture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our study establishes the rippled beta sheet layer configuration as a motif with general features and opens the road to structure-based design of unique molecular architectures, with potential for materials development and biomedical applications,&#8221; said Jevgenij Raskatov, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz and corresponding author of the paper.</p>
<p>Proteins come in an enormous range of shapes and sizes to carry out their myriad structural and functional roles in living cells. Certain common structural motifs, such as the alpha helix, are found in many protein structures.</p>
<p>The rippled sheet is a variation on the pleated beta sheet, a well-known structural motif found in thousands of proteins. Linus Pauling and Robert Corey described the rippled beta sheet in 1953, two years after introducing the concept of the pleated beta sheet. While the pleated beta sheet is well known and often called simply the beta sheet, the rippled sheet remained a largely theoretical structure for decades.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/12/rippled-sheets.html">previous study</a> published in 2021, Raskatov's team reported obtaining a rippled beta sheet structure by mixing a small peptide with equal amounts of its mirror image. The researchers used mirror-image forms of triphenylalanine, a short peptide consisting of three phenylalanine amino acids. The mirror-image peptides joined in pairs to form "dimers" with the predicted structure, but they did not form the extended, periodic rippled beta-sheet layer topography hypothesized by Pauling and Corey.</p>
<p>"The dimers packed together into herringbone layer structures, which raised doubt as to whether the periodic rippled beta-sheet layer configuration was viable," Raskatov said.</p>
<p>In the new study, the researchers substituted other amino acids for one of the triphenylalanines to create slightly different tripeptides and their mirror-images. Using these new tripeptides, they were able to create three different aggregating peptide systems that formed extended antiparallel rippled beta sheet layers, in which mirror-image peptide strands were arranged in alternating fashion. The results of x-ray crystallography showed that the crystal structures are in excellent overall agreement with the predictions made by Pauling and Corey.</p>
<p>The co-first authors of the paper are Amaruka Hazari, a staff scientist in Raskatov&#8217;s lab, and Michael Sawaya at UCLA. Other coauthors include Timothy Johnstone at UC Santa Cruz and Niko Vlahakis, David Boyer, Jose Rodriguez, and David Eisenberg at UCLA.

He was 92.</p>
<p>A professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics and former dean of natural sciences at UC Santa Cruz, Drake also served for 19 years as chair of the board of trustees of the SETI Institute, a nonprofit organization focused on research and education related to the search for life beyond Earth.</p>
<p>Drake's daughter Nadia Drake announced his death on her <a href="https://www.nadiadrake.com/">web site</a>, where she wrote that her father &#8220;was beloved by many, and for many reasons, but above all, today I celebrate his humanity, his tenderness, his gentle spirit. A titan in life, Dad leaves a titanic absence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drake is widely known for, among other things, the &#8220;Drake Equation,&#8221; which he devised in 1961 to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations that might be detectable in our galaxy. The equation served as an effective framework for rigorous consideration and planning of efforts to detect extraterrestrial intelligence. At the time, Drake was head of telescope operations at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, West Virginia, where he had conducted the first organized search for radio signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources in 1960 (Project Ozma).</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Drake worked to refine the methods for the detection of signals of extraterrestrial intelligence. He also shared in the discovery of the radiation belts of Jupiter and played an important role in the observational studies that led to the early understanding of pulsars (rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit beams of radiation).</p>
<h2>First interstellar message</h2>
<p>Drake created the first interstellar message ever transmitted deliberately into space from Earth. Known as the &#8220;Arecibo message,&#8221; it was broadcast via radio waves from the Arecibo Observatory in 1974. Drake was also involved (with Carl Sagan and others) in designing the plaques carried on the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft and the &#8220;Golden Record&#8221; carried on the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, with messages intended for any intelligent life the spacecraft might encounter on their journeys beyond the solar system.</p>
<p>Born in 1930 in Chicago, Drake earned a B.A. in engineering physics at Cornell University and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in astronomy at Harvard University. He served as an electronics officer in the U.S. Navy from 1952 to 1955.</p>
<p>After working at NRAO, Drake served briefly as chief of the Lunar and Planetary Sciences Section at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory before joining the astronomy faculty at Cornell University in 1964, where he was appointed the Goldwin Smith Professor of Astronomy in 1976. He served as associate director of Cornell&#8217;s Center for Radiophysics and Space Research, and he was director of the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico from 1966 to 1968. He also served as director of the National Astronomy and Ionospheric Center (which includes Arecibo Observatory) from its establishment in 1971 until 1981.</p>
<h2>Dean of natural sciences</h2>
<p>Drake came to UC Santa Cruz in 1984 to serve as dean of the Division of Natural Sciences, leading the division during a period of rapid growth in the campus&#8217;s science and engineering programs. He taught innovative courses in astronomy for non-science majors and mentored many undergraduate and graduate astronomy students. His wide-ranging leadership in public outreach and education in astronomy were recognized by the American Astronomical Society in 2001 with its first Education Prize.</p>
<p>After retiring from teaching in 1996, Drake continued to pursue his interest in the detection of extraterrestrial life, investigating radio telescope designs that optimize the chances of success for SETI and participating in projects at UC&#8217;s Lick Observatory to search for optical signals of extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
<p>A member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Drake served as president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, vice president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, chair of the National Research Council&#8217;s Board on Physics and Astronomy, and director of the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe at the SETI Institute.</p>
<p>Frank Drake is survived by his wife of 44 years, Amahl Shakhashiri Drake; daughters Nadia Drake (Scott Ransom), and Leila Drake Fossek (Chris Fossek); from a previous marriage, sons Steve Drake, Richard Drake (Alice Moore) and Paul Drake (Ellen Sullivan); daughters-in-law Mary and Kim; and four grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his sister Alma Quigley.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ff28474d807270465a2acc6ad3a1decf"><name>redwood-freemarket</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Giving basic needs a needed solution</title><summary>The Redwood Free Market provides free food and basic needs to UC Santa Cruz students to combat food insecurity.&#13;

Though initially funded by the Global Food Initiative, the Redwood Free Market now relies on donations to keep its shelves stocked.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, the program has changed its location and name as it grew, adopting the title &#8220;Redwood Free Market&#8221; to dispel stigma surrounding food pantries. The name isn&#8217;t the only way in which the free market differs from its original food pantry label</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the market ensures that students who pass through are given both a choice in their meals and access to nutrition.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You obviously can't study if you're hungry, or if you&#8217;re wondering where your next meal is coming from,&#8221; said UCSC Basic Needs Coordinator Estefan&#237;a Rodriguez. &#8220;Something as basic as access to food, for some people, is not basic. </span><strong>The Redwood Free Market helps keep students here, so that they can finish their degrees and move on to bigger and better things.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its founding, the Redwood Free Market has experienced consistent annual growth with more students making visits for their daily essentials. With 2729 visits and 1640 unique visitors in the 2017-2018 academic year to a total of 8161 with 2556 unique visitors in the 2021-2022 academic year. Though the increase in visitors may seem to be a further indicator of food insecurity, it also shows the growing awareness and service of the market; the thousands of visitors having their needs fulfilled by the market.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Redwood Free Market is run for and by the students, with a system that provides both employment to its workers and resources to the community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">workers themselves often also participate in the free market as customers. The Redwood Free Market puts students at the center of their program in a holistic sense</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">every choice, from who stocks the shelves to what&#8217;s taken off them, is put into clear consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We really try to use a holistic approach,&#8221; Rodriguez said. &#8220;[We consider] What types of food? Where does it come from? Is it culturally relevant? Is the space welcoming? Are we taking into consideration the backgrounds of students, and how we can make it as welcoming and friendly as possible? From the second you walk in here to when you leave, what do you take home with you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The staff&#8217;s dedication to their mission is unparalleled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">even in the face of extreme circumstances. In the years following its opening, the Redwood Free Market would adapt to both regional and global disasters: be it a global pandemic or a major wildfire, the Redwood Free Market persevered to serve the community in its most vulnerable moments. Rodriguez said the kitchen made sure to always be there for the students no matter the challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were open during the entire pandemic, with a skeleton crew. We were also open during the CZU fire complex, where we evacuated from the campus with enough stuff in a box truck.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodriguez recalled a story of a student who stopped by the market when they were comparatively understocked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a moment that demonstrated the necessity of the market beyond just the hard data associated with food insecurity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We had almost nothing on the shelf, but we had a student come in who said &#8216;oh my god, you guys have so much stuff! I literally have no food in my fridge or my cabinets. I haven't eaten anything. In a few days.&#8217; And we were saying, &#8216;we're sorry, we don't have as much as we normally do on the shelves or produce wise.&#8217; And they were like, &#8216;no, this is great.&#8217; It was really humbling just seeing what a valuable resource we are.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of the market&#8217;s student-centered mission can be seen through Joy Swanberg, (College Nine, 23&#8217;) a worker at the Redwood Free Market, who discovered the market through the Renaissance Scholars Program in the spring of 2020.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a sociology major, Swanberg aimed to work on a project that had both a social benefit to the UCSC community and a heavy student involvement, and the Redwood Free Market fulfilled both criteria. Swanberg recalled conversations with users of the Redwood Free Market, often calling upon her own experience to give advice on dealing with food insecurity through programs like CalFresh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swanberg said that she sees the impact of the market throughout her work, and hopes that its reach can extend far beyond its current size.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our funding is based on donations, so the more students that come in, the more funding we get to continue to help the students, expand our services, and expand our reach as well,&#8221; Swanberg said. &#8220;That's my hope for the future, being able to serve as many students as possible and impact them in a positive way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As food insecurity continues to face college students across the nation and within the community, the need for the Redwood Free Market continues to grow. In the face of this challenge, Swanberg gives a warm welcome for all to come to the Redwood Free Market, no matter their status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anyone is welcome at the pantry: students, staff, faculty, anyone is allowed to come in. Anyone who can use groceries, you can utilize the produce. We don't have a limit to how much you can pick up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, we're happy to give away the food so that we're not contributing to waste on this campus. It's a judgment free zone. If you will use it, we'll give it to you, and we'll do it with a smile on our face.&#8221;</span></p>

The 2020 CZU Lightning Complex wildfires destroyed roughly 1,000 homes in Santa Cruz County, and required the emergency evacuation of campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential for a wildfire on our campus remains, our region continues to experience severe drought conditions, and much of the vegetation on our campus and in parts of the Santa Cruz Mountains remains dangerously dry.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to confront this uncertainty is through preparation, and we need your help with that. The Office of Emergency Management is partnering with our campus Institutional Research, Assessment, and Policy Studies to gather information for planning purposes related to the evacuation needs of our campus community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An evacuation-information form has been developed to help us with this information gathering. You can find the form </span><a href="https://relay.ucsc.edu/r/fc86d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This will also be emailed to faculty, staff, and students later this month.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Questions on the form range from where you generally work or study (Main Residential Campus, Coastal Science Campus, Scotts Valley Center,, etc.), how you would leave during an evacuation, and whether you might need transportation assistance if an emergency evacuation were ordered. All information gathered will inform our emergency planning &#8212; how many buses or hotel rooms would be needed, for example.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you in advance for your cooperation. The more participation we have, the better prepared we will be. Questions about the form can be directed to oes@ucsc.edu.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="13119149807270465a2acc6af28aa854"><name>move-in-volunteers</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Move-in volunteers needed</title><summary>UCSC’s fall move-in will take place over four days, September 15 through 18, to welcome new residents to our campus.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of the Title IX Office at UC Santa Cruz is to serve as a support resource for students, staff, and faculty who may have experienced sexual violence and sexual harassment, and sex-based discrimination.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Responsible Employee Are Required to Report</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most employees&#8212;with the exception of&#160; confidential employees (Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS), CARE, &amp; Employee Assistance Program (EAP), are required to report to the Title IX Office if they learn about sexual violence or sexual harassment which involves a student. Supervisors and managers, faculty, HR and Academic Personnel administrators, and campus police must also report if they learn that a university affiliate may have experienced possible misconduct under the </span><a href="https://www.ucop.edu/title-ix/resources/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SVSH Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have an </span><a href="https://uctitleix.i-sight.com/portal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online reporting form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you can use to fulfill your reporting responsibilities, receive confirmation of your report, and ensure that we can respond quickly. Our office is more than happy to meet with you for a consultation if you have any questions or concerns.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Employee Support</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Title IX Office is not an emergency response organization, but does respond quickly to reports, can provide safety and supportive measures as needed, and can work with the complainant to determine how to proceed. By reporting to the Title IX Office, you help us connect with parties that are in need of resources and support, and provide us with important information for addressing safety concerns on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage staff and faculty to reach out for support. The Title IX Office is a resource for staff and faculty as well as students. You can report to the Title IX Office to receive support or to assist others in gaining support from our office. Our ultimate goal is to foster a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for learning, teaching, research, and working. You can </span><a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu/resources/printable-resourcesandoptions-4page.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">find more information about resources and options on our website here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome and hello to all new and returning students, staff, and faculty! We want to take this opportunity to introduce you to the Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) Initiatives. Our office is dedicated to support our campus&#8217;s racial equity goals to open academic and career pathways for Latinx and low-income students. We focus on being race conscious with the goal of improving our institutional practices and policies to better serve our student community as a whole.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next week we will celebrate </span><a href="https://www.hacu.net/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=3739"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Hispanic-Serving Institution Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. National Hispanic-Serving Institution week aims to bring awareness to the important roles that HSIs have for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">improving access to education and advancing equity for traditionally underserved students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help us celebrate, we encourage you to follow our </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ucsc.hsi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as we will be launching a social media campaign to highlight the programs and services available to undergraduate and graduate students funded by HSI grants. Have a little fun playing our trivia game while learning more about our HSI identity! We will also be hosting two Instagram Live sessions for you to connect with current students and ask questions prior to moving in (please see our schedule below for more details). Throughout the year we&#8217;ll continue to post about upcoming events, academic programs, and various campus resources including internship opportunities. We also encourage you to check out our </span><a href="http://hsi.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn more about our team and HSI efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, I would like to highlight one of our key campus partners and their upcoming welcome event,&#160; </span><a href="https://elcentro.ucsc.edu/events/annual-events/la-bienvenida.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Bienvenida</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: New Student Welcome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, taking place on Saturday, October 8, 2022 from 1:00-3:00pm at the Quarry Amphitheater. This new student welcome event is hosted by the </span><a href="http://www.elcentro.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicanx Latinx Resource Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, better known as El Centro. The purpose of this event is to introduce and connect students to El Centro, a variety of Chicanx and Latinx student organizations, and campus resources. Free food, community building, music, and student performances are part of the evening's fun! All students, staff, and faculty are welcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We invite you to get plugged in and expand your network! Our HSI Initiatives staff, Leadership Committee, campus partners, and collaborators are all excited to meet and get to know you at one of our upcoming events or programs.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I write today with sadness to share </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/frank-drake-in-memoriam.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news of the passing of Frank Drake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, UC Santa Cruz professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics and an eminent radio astronomer. Drake was known for pioneering work in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). He died at his home in Aptos on Sept. 2. He was 92.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drake was a groundbreaking explorer in his field. In the early 1960s, as head of telescope operations at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, W.Va. he conducted the first organized search for radio signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources. One of his goals was&#160; to answer one of the biggest questions still unanswered today: are we alone in the universe?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1961, he convened a group of ten scientists that included Carl Sagan; biochemist Melvin Calvin who was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry during the workshop; Barney Oliver, research chief of Hewlett-Packard; and dolphin expert John Lilly. They came together secretly to talk about the search for intelligent life beyond Earth. During that gathering, Drake devised the &#8220;Drake Equation,&#8221; to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations scientists might be able to find in the Milky Way galaxy. In 2012, Drake </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/30/science/space/seti-research-is-revived-life-out-there.html?searchResultPosition=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that according to the equation, there are 100 billion &#8216;suitable stars in the galaxy.&#8217; &#8220;I&#8217;ve known all along we have to look at a million stars.&#8221; Sixty years later, the equation still stands.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1974, Drake created the first interstellar message to be deliberately sent into space from Earth via radio waves from the Arecibo Observatory. And he partnered with Carl Sagan and others to design the Pioneer Plaque that was carried on the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft and the &#8220;Golden Record&#8221; on Voyager 1 and 2, messages to any intelligent life that might come in contact with the vehicles.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drake came to UC Santa Cruz in 1984, as the dean of the Division of Natural Sciences. He took undergraduates into space through his innovative courses for non-science majors, and helped undergraduate and graduate students take their studies to deeper levels through his mentoring.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He retired from UCSC in 1996, but that did not end his search to detect extraterrestrial life. He continued working on radio telescope design and joined projects at UC&#8217;s Lick Observatory.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Drake was born in Chicago in 1930. He received a B.A. in engineering physics from Cornell University and went on to continue his studies at Harvard University earning M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in astronomy. He served briefly as chief of the Lunar and Planetary Sciences Section at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and then returned to his alma mater joining Cornell&#8217;s astronomy faculty in 1964. In 1976, he was appointed the Goldwin Smith Professor of Astronomy. Drake was also associate director of the university&#8217;s Center for Radiophysics and Space Research and director of the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico from 1966-1968.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was dedicated to pursuing knowledge in his field and searching for extraterrestrial intelligence inside and outside the university setting. For 19 years, Drake served as chair of the board of trustees of the SETI Institute, a nonprofit organization focused on research and education related to the search for life beyond Earth. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, served as president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, vice president of the American Association of the Advancement of Science, chair of the National Research Council&#8217;s Board on Physics and Astronomy, and director of the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe at the SETI Institute.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I offer my condolences to our community members who had the privilege of being Frank Drake&#8217;s colleagues, students, mentees, and friends. I am grateful for the legacy he has left our university and the impact he has had and will continue to have in the years ahead.&#160;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This award, presented at the annual International Conference on Concurrency Theory, recognizes important achievements in concurrency theory, which has to do with the timing of programs, algorithms, or problems.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-45187-7_9">The paper</a></span><span class="s1"> studies the effect of time and delay between moves in a two-person game. Prior to this work, game theory focused on the effect moves have on a game, independently from&#160; precisely when they are played. De Alfaro and his co-authors Marco Faella, Thomas Henzinger, Rupak Majumdar, and Mari&#235;lle Stoelinga found that if players can choose not only which move to play, but also precisely when<i> </i>to play it, they can take each other by surprise.&#160; This &#8220;surprise&#8221; effect can be used to win games that could not be won if moves are played at predetermined times.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;One of the beautiful results of this paper is that it determines that the element of surprise is important,&#8221; de Alfaro said. &#8220;Time really adds a new dimension to the types of strategies you can use to play a game.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The paper presents a model of timed games, laying out a complex method for computing their solutions and thus instructing on how to win. This model is constrained by what can be considered a physically meaningful strategy, as the amount of time a player takes to move must be physically achievable.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the paper describes a generalized game theory approach, the results are applicable to many real-world situations such as commerce systems, driving, and more. Significantly, these results are influential for the subfield of computer science that deals with understanding system behavior and how pieces of systems interact.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Timed games are important because they represent many control problems,&#8221; de Alfaro said. &#8220;This is important for control theory, the design of embedded software that controls systems, and has indications for understanding the interactions between systems that can often be modeled as a game.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">De Alfaro&#8217;s foundational work has been cited in nearly 200 papers on system interaction, modeling of time systems, and the design of controls. De Alfaro called this project a &#8220;particularly beautiful collaboration&#8221; between the co-authors, who are from several countries around the&#160; world and two of which were visiting him in Santa Cruz at the time of the research. He noted that all of the co-authors have gone on to very successful careers in academia.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="18a0a011807270465a2acc6ad388dac0"><name>prochaska-pivot-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>With Pivot Fellowship, astronomer J.

J. Xavier Prochaska, for example, is a distinguished professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz who has won acclaim for his groundbreaking research in astrophysics, but he has also maintained an interest in oceanography since he was an undergraduate.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Prochaska has been taking advanced oceanography classes at UCSC and forging collaborations with ocean scientists. Now, thanks to a Pivot Fellowship from the Simons Foundation, he will be able to spend a year focusing on oceanography research starting in fall 2023.</p>
<p>Prochaska's interest in the ocean dates back to his childhood in Rhode Island. As an undergraduate physics major at Princeton University, he did a summer research project at the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography, located in his hometown. But his interest in astronomy won out&#8212;he earned his Ph.D. studying the distant universe at UC San Diego and went on to a highly successful career in which he has made important contributions in several areas of astronomy and astrophysics.</p>
<p>In May 2020, Prochaska published two major papers, one solving the decades-old mystery of the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/05/missing-matter.html">"missing matter" in the universe</a> and another on the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/05/wolfe-disk.html">discovery of a massive rotating disk galaxy in the early universe</a>. Each paper was the culmination of more than 20 years of research.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt the time was right to turn my scientific focus to new directions,&#8221; he said. "As I learned more about oceanography, I quickly recognized I could apply the skills and expertise I'd honed pursuing astronomy to questions and challenges on our planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he saw the call for applications for the Pivot Fellowships in February of this year, he said, &#8220;I thought, that is for me. I'm not going to drop astronomy yet, but I see opportunities for me to make real contributions in oceanography.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prochaska will spend his fellowship year at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, working with Professor Daniel Rudnick, an observational oceanographer whose research focuses on processes in the upper ocean. The fellowship will cover his salary for the year while he is on leave from UCSC, and it also provides funds for research, travel, and professional development.</p>
<p>As an astronomer, Prochaska has made extensive use of the powerful techniques of spectroscopy, which separates the light from a source into its constituent wavelengths. Oceanographers use a spectroscopic technique called hyperspectral imaging for remote sensing of ocean ecosystems, and Prochaska said he sees opportunities to apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the analysis of hyperspectral imaging data. NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission is expected to launch in 2024 and will provide unprecedented amounts of global hyperspectral imaging data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spectroscopy has been my primary practice as a scientist, central to my major contributions in astrophysics,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At Scripps, one of the projects I hope to do will combine hyperspectral imaging datasets with observations on the California coast to study the origins of harmful algal blooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prochaska said he is also interested in developing new instruments to incorporate spectroscopy into existing ocean monitoring systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely I will be doing some combination of spectroscopy, instrumentation, and AI,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Prochaska said he considers his current level of expertise in oceanography &#8220;roughly equivalent to a Ph.D. student with several years of experience.&#8221; The Pivot Fellowship will enable him to focus on oceanography for an extended period and establish a foundation for future funding proposals. It will also give him the opportunity to apply for a three-year research award from the Simons Foundation for up to $1.5 million to support his work in the new field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scientists who move into new fields have had outsize impact,&#8221; said Simons Foundation president David Spergel. &#8220;This new program aims to enable and accelerate this process and to break down barriers between fields.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="190e100b807270465a2acc6a86fa8e83"><name>nsf-coastal-hub</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC partners in NSF research hub to use nature to protect coastal communities</title><summary>A $20 million NSF grant funds the new Climate Risks and Equitable Nature-based Solutions Hub, focusing on coral reef and mangrove ecosystems.</summary><keywords>Michael Beck, Borja Reguero</keywords><start-date>1662534000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC partners in NSF research hub to use nature to protect coastal communities</display-name><path>/2022/09/nsf-coastal-hub</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/09/nsf-coastal-hub</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1662572695534</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662572960773</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/mike-beck-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/mike-beck-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mike-beck-350.jpg</name><display-name>mike-beck-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>65463</file-size><width>350</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt>Michael Beck</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/mike-beck-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/mike-beck-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mike-beck-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>mike-beck-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18227</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Michael Beck</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Michael Beck</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/borja-reguero-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/borja-reguero-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>borja-reguero-350.jpg</name><display-name>borja-reguero-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>50631</file-size><width>348</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt>Borja Reguero</image-alt><image-caption>Borja Reguero</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>A $20 million NSF grant funds the new Climate Risks and Equitable Nature-based Solutions Hub, focusing on coral reef and mangrove ecosystems </article-subhead><article-text><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded an interdisciplinary team of researchers a $20 million grant to assess climate risks and identify where coral reefs and mangroves can best protect underserved coastal communities. The project is part of the NSF&#8217;s <a href="https://beta.nsf.gov/news/nsf-announces-new-awards-understand-coastal-systems-and-tackle-coastal-hazards">Coastlines and People program</a>.</p>
<p>Michael Beck, a research professor who holds the AXA Chair in Coastal Resilience at UC Santa Cruz, will serve as co-director of the new Climate Risks and Equitable Nature-based Solutions Hub, partnering with Professor Maya Trotz, the lead principal investigator at the University of South Florida.</p>
<p>The hub will work to develop scalable and equitable engineering practices to build coastal sustainability by combining natural features, such as coral reefs and mangrove forests, with more built infrastructure, such as seawalls and floodwater pumps, to promote resilience to waves, storm surges, and sea level rise&#8212;threats that can cause property damage, erosion, and loss of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Climate risks are rising, and they have particularly devastating effects on vulnerable coastal communities,&#8221; Beck said. &#8220;Coral reefs and mangroves can protect these communities from storms and be part of their solution for climate adaptation. By rigorously assessing climate risk and the socio-economic protections provided by reefs and mangroves, we open new opportunities to invest in these habitats and ensure their benefits for people and nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>The research aims to quantify the social and ecological factors required to develop effective policy changes and advance public and private investment in disaster risk prevention and reduction. Beck and his collaborators in the UCSC <a href="https://www.coastalresiliencelab.org/">Coastal Resilience Lab</a> have shown that reefs and mangroves provide tens of billions of dollars in flood protection every year, including to communities in Florida, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Belize, where the project will be focused.</p>
<p>Borja Reguero, an associate research professor at UCSC, will lead the research thrust on assessing coastal hazards, risks, and the benefits of nature-based adaptation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will use the latest global climate models to drive coastal hazard projections and develop models to assess the role of ecosystems in coastal change across spatial and temporal scales,&#8221; Reguero said. &#8220;The goal is to assess linkages between changes in climate, ecosystems, shoreline change, and nature-based solutions across time scales&#8221;.</p>
<p>In addition to USF and UCSC, the research team also includes experts from Boston University, Stanford University, University of Miami, University of Virgin Islands, and East Carolina University. They are also working with the World Wildlife Fund, an international organization working to reduce human impact on natural environments; Fragments of Hope Ltd., which has been pioneering scalable coral reef restoration in Belize; and Black in Marine Science, which seeks to broaden participation in the marine science field.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1a4f7cfe807270465a2acc6a9c43f406"><name>pbsci-dean-search</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Launching search for dean of Physical &amp; Biological Sciences</title><summary>We are happy to announce the kickoff of a national recruitment for our next dean of the  &#13;

Principal investigators on these projects will pursue multidisciplinary research related to this year&#8217;s theme of climate resilience.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Researchers were tasked with designing solutions to significant social challenges related to climate resilience through new or existing technology. Grants of up to $40,000 will fund research on green hydrogen, robotic ecological monitoring, self-driving electric tractors, and a no-waste home water system.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;This year again we had an extremely strong list of applicants and the committee's decisions were not easy,&#8221; said CITRIS UCSC Campus Director J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, distinguished professor and chair of the computer science and engineering department at the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;We feel the four projects we're able to fund this year show great promise in exploring some extremely creative and diverse approaches to increasing our resilience to climate change.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Generating green hydrogen with seawater&#160;</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nobuhiko Kobayashi, professor of electrical and computer engineering, will lead a project to advance his innovative method for generating hydrogen from seawater as a form of renewable energy. Kobayashi and his team will transform their electrolysis technique for generating calcium carbonate from seawater, originally designed for coral reef restoration, into a process to create green hydrogen &#8211; hydrogen that is economically and environmentally sound. This technique holds promise for storing the electrical energy produced by other renewable energy sources such as wind or solar, as well as being a form of renewable energy itself. Donald Potts, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and Yu Zhang, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, will be co-principal investigators on the project.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ecological monitoring with robotics</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the changing climate affects plants worldwide, understanding how to conserve ecological resources and adjusting agricultural practices to adapt to shifting climate conditions is imperative. Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Steve McGuire will develop a system that uses aerial robots, ground vehicles, and expert human operators to automate the identification and remediation of plant disease and environmental stress in wild and agricultural settings. The team will use data collected from novel robotics to create predictive models that can help proactively mitigate negative environmental impacts on plant life. Professor of Environmental Studies Greg Gilbert will be a co-principal investigator on the project.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Autonomous electric tractors for farming</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Dejan Milutinovic will lead a project to develop technology for fully autonomous farming using small tractors powered by solar or wind energy. The team will focus on three areas: the tractors&#8217; ability to visually perceive its surroundings, tractor navigation along rows of plants, and incorporation of underrepresented farmers and farm communities in development of this technology. Stacy Philpott, professor of environmental studies and faculty director for the UCSC Center for Agroeocology will be the co-principal investigator on the project.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Net-zero home water systems&#160;</strong></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The changing climate may require households to dramatically reduce their reliance on local freshwater resources. To address this, project principal investigator and physics professor Sue Carter is designing &#8203;&#8203;a fully net-zero water residence for a four-person household &#8211; supplying water for drinking, gardening, appliances, heating and cooling systems, and more. The system, which will integrate rainwater capture, remediation, and sensor systems to ensure water safety, will be demonstrated as part of UCSC&#8217;s entry in the Orange County Sustainability Decathlon challenge. Professor of Environmental Studies Elliott Campbell will be a co-principal investigator on the project.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the annual meeting of the </span><a href="https://www.asanet.org/annual-meeting"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Sociological Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ASA) in August, Craig Reinarman, professor emeritus of sociology, was honored with the 2022 Senior Scholar Award by the ASA&#8217;s Drugs and Society Section.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reinarman, who spent 27 years at UC Santa Cruz before retiring in 2016, is known for his research challenging U.S. drug policies, drug and alcohol use, and the relationship between addiction and incarceration rates.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of his career, Reinarman conducted extensive research and advocated for the decriminalization of cannabis, which is now legal in 37 states for medical use and 19 states for recreational use. His research found that cannabis was usually not a gateway to &#8220;harder&#8221; drugs, crime, and drug dependency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to shift the discourse from criminal law to public health as a more effective way to handle drug abuse,&#8221; Reinarman said. &#8220;The United States was slower than most in embracing this change, but they are coming around.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reinarman also co-authored a book on crack cocaine and public policy, was co-editor of a book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding Addiction&#8211;Critical Essays</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has appeared in numerous scholarly journals, and has written opinion pieces for newspapers such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Gomez Parra, a Ph.D. student in sociology, received the </span><a href="https://www.asanet.org/communities-sections/sections/current-sections/sexualities/sociology-sexualities-award-recipient-history"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sociology of Sexualities' Martin P. Levine Memorial Dissertation Fellowship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the ASA meeting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parra&#8217;s dissertation incorporates her lived experience as a college-going Latina daughter of a single Latina immigrant mother and how that has influenced her views of gender and sexuality.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My research examines how two mobility paths, higher education and migration, shape Latinas&#8217; own gender and sexual identity and generational negotiations of these social forces among migrant mothers and their daughters,&#8221; Parra said. &#8220;For example, immigrant women often grow up with a negative view of sex due to their experiences of sexual or domestic violence and a lack of sexual health resources.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;On the other hand, their college-going daughters learn sex positivity while in college, which facilitates their exploration of sexual identities. This new information often leads the daughters to begin advocating more for their mothers and their sexual health.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fellowship, named after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sociologist and educator Martin Levine, who specialized in research on homosexuality and AIDS,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides $3,000 to a graduate student in the final stages of their dissertation research and writing. Parra plans to use the funding to interview mothers and daughters in Los Angeles, where she grew up.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parra is also a recent recipient of the </span><a href="https://sociology.ucsc.edu/about/directory-grads.php?uid=mparra3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC President&#8217;s Pre-Professoriate Fellowship and the UC HSI DDi Pre-Professoriate Fellowship.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She hopes to one day become a professor at a public institution for first-generation girls of color and work with a community-based organization that provides access to sexual education resources for the immigrant community.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only University of California campus on the list, the ranking recognizes the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-santa-cruz-1321">world-class education</a> that UC Santa Cruz students receive and reflects the commitment from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">faculty and campus leaders to impactful educational innovations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our values and commitment to student success guide our efforts and we take great pride in having our faculty recognized for their commitment to teaching and learning,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;This reflects the university&#8217;s long standing focus on outstanding teaching, mentoring and experiential learning.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz also ranked among the top public universities (No. 35), the best national universities (No. 83), and universities with the greatest social mobility (No. 18). UC Santa Cruz is also among the universities where students incur the least amount of debt as they work toward earning a degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well known for computer science education and research, the UC Santa Cruz undergraduate program in </span><a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer Game Design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked No. 5 and the </span><a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer Science program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked No. 46.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting its work in creating a better world and commitment to sustainability, UC Santa Cruz was named the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/princeton-public-impact.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. 2 university for public university in the nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for students focused on making an impact on the world and the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/11/green-campus.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. 3 green college in the nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Princeton Review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Hispanic-Serving research university centered on student success, UC Santa Cruz is on an unprecedented trajectory, with faculty pursuing research that is having a transformative impact on society while also playing a central role in the classroom experience, as students learn from those on the cutting edge of scholarship and knowledge creation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU), reflecting the quality of the campus&#8217; research as well as graduate and undergraduate teaching. Earlier this year, UC Santa Cruz joined other leading universities </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/alliance-hispanic-serving-research-universities.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to form the Alliance of Hispanic Serving Research Universities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a coalition of 21 research universities that aim to increase opportunity for those historically underserved by higher education. The campus also holds the distinction of being an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pairing of high-impact research with 10 vibrant and interdisciplinary residential colleges offers undergraduate students the experience of a small liberal arts college with the depth and rigor of a major research university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our outstanding faculty is committed to advancing student success inside and outside the classroom," said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer. "We are increasing opportunities for undergraduates to join in research and creative scholarship earlier in their academic careers, learning what it means to create knowledge and gaining experience that contributes to academic and professional success."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is focused on providing an unparalleled educational experience that supports students while they&#8217;re earning a degree and positions them for success when they graduate. The five-year </span><a href="https://success.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Success Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, launched last year, has already raised more than $22 million to increase financial support for undergraduate and graduate students, and advance their access to the mentoring and experiences fundamental to their education and ultimately future success.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"UCSC provides students with incredible opportunities to become the next generation of leaders working to solve the world's biggest challenges and unanswered questions," Kletzer said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Student Success Initiative and UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CITL) have been key to elevating the undergraduate learning experience on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CITL uses research and equity-minded practices to strengthen the culture of teaching, foster student success and equitable outcomes, and support teacher-leaders. Founded in 2016 to continue and refresh the university&#8217;s long tradition of educational innovation, CITL&#8217;s goal is to help educators and students thrive through use of the latest research and educational technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz campus community has been working to ensure that equity is at the forefront of its teaching and learning efforts. This has been central to CITL&#8217;s work, and includes everything from specific pedagogical approaches used in courses to working as partners with graduate students to offer opportunities for leadership and robust training for their important role in undergraduate courses and as future faculty. The work is just beginning, but the collaborative efforts are already driving towards improving student retention, persistence, academic achievement, and sense of belonging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a broad curriculum, CITL runs several faculty-geared programs that promote excellence in undergraduate teaching. The New Faculty Teaching Academy is designed for faculty in all fields, whether or not they are new to college-level teaching. This Academy introduces new faculty to UC Santa Cruz students and to the fundamentals of evidence-based teaching practices and course design and delivery that promote equitable outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed by CITL in partnership with the UC Santa Cruz HSI Initiatives team, Institutional Research, Assessment, &amp; Policy Studies, and faculty innovators, Project REAL is designed to provide faculty with a research-based program to engage in comprehensive equity-minded course redesign to improve teaching and learning and contribute to equitable outcomes for students at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Graduate Pedagogy Fellows Program recognizes the great power of graduate students as part of our course teaching teams and invites them in as peer leaders to implement evidence-based pedagogy across all departments on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz has, since its founding, had a special commitment to creating transformative learning experiences for undergraduates,&#8221; said Robin Dunkin, acting faculty director for CITL. &#8220;This recognition for undergraduate teaching is reflective of the sustained commitment to an equity first approach that faculty, graduate students, staff, and campus leadership have taken over the past decade to ensure every student has the opportunity to excel using the unique strengths and experience they bring with them from the diverse backgrounds from which they arrive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. News and World Report</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> looks at a variety of factors in its rankings, including retention and graduation rates, social mobility, faculty resources, and more.</span></p>

Her first day was Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anju is a wonderful addition to our campus community. She is a collaborative, accessible leader who seeks to lead by listening. She brings a wealth of professional experience in diversity, equity and inclusion work, both in the college classroom as an educator and as a senior leader. She comes to UC Santa Cruz from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where she served most recently as Assistant Vice Provost for Strategic Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Administration.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before transitioning to higher education leadership, Anju was a tenured associate professor in the Department of History and International Studies at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point. Anju&#8217;s experience with varied constituencies will help immensely as she partners with people around our campus to create a more welcoming and equitable institution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At UW Madison, she reported directly to the university&#8217;s chief diversity officer and oversaw numerous units engaged in various DEI-related efforts, among other duties. She holds a Ph.D. and a master&#8217;s degree, both in history, from the University of Texas at Austin. She earned a diploma in economics from the London School of Economics &amp; Political Science, and a bachelor of arts in history from Princeton University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I offer my thanks to Judith Estrada, Assistant Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, who has served as interim Chief Diversity Officer since last summer. Judith has been a vocal advocate for creating a more welcoming, just, and inclusive campus since her arrival at UC Santa Cruz nine years ago. Judith will continue as the office&#8217;s assistant vice chancellor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, by prioritizing student success, elevating research excellence, fostering an inclusive campus climate, and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, we are laying the foundation for a bright future for our campus as a whole, and for our students specifically. Anju&#8217;s arrival makes us even stronger. Please join me in offering her a warm welcome!&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="324a9fec807270465a2acc6afa197232"><name>uw--tn-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC’s United Way Employee Campaign now underway</title><summary>This year’s UC Santa Cruz employee campaign in support of United Way of Santa Cruz County is launching today.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am thrilled to officially launch this year&#8217;s UC Santa Cruz employee campaign in support of United Way of Santa Cruz County! Those new to our campus community may not be aware of the important support the United Way provides to Santa Cruz County. Just this summer, the local group partnered with the county Office of Education to raise more than $32,000 to purchase school supplies and backpacks for more than 2,100 youth experiencing homelessness. Over 150 volunteers, including UCSC staff, helped stuff the backpacks, helping to ensure that K-12 students returned to the classroom with the supplies they needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the past two years, through the generous support of donors and advocates like you, United Way of Santa Cruz County has:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responded to more than 8,000 calls for assistance, delivered thousands of food pantry and meal boxes, placed more than 1,000 people in hotels during wildfire evacuations, and provided financial assistance to those impacted by COVID-19 and the CZU Lightning Complex fires.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched a Youth Action Network &#8212; now with nearly 60 members&#8212;&#160; to focus on amplifying youth voices, increasing co-generational solutions with adult allies, and positioning youth as the drivers of community change.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sought to create new ways to support local youth, providing tutoring, family counseling, mindfulness activities, and other whole-person services through the United 4 Youth neighborhood initiative in Watsonville and Santa Cruz/Live Oak.</span></li>
</ul>

When she read the posting for a job to be part of a team opening two new colleges at UC Santa Cruz, she saw the opportunity to merge her passion with her professional work. Colleges Nine and Ten would focus on international global perspectives and social justice and community, respectively. And she already knew about the university&#8217;s long-standing commitment to social justice and sustainability.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A theme throughout my life has always been about learning how I can make the world a better place and how I can use my privilege, particularly my white skin, my cis-gendered-ness, my able-bodied-ness to truly make an impact, to plant some seeds that can ultimately create some of the changes that I&#8217;d like to see in our world to make it more peaceful, more sustainable, more socially just,&#8221; Woodside Bury said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just over 20 years later, Woodside Bury is the senior director of College Student Life at four UC Santa Cruz residential colleges: Cowell College, Stevenson College, College Nine and the recently dedicated John R. Lewis College (formerly College Ten). Together they address some of the most challenging and pressing issues facing us today as individuals and as a society. &#8220;I'd like to hope that my work is helping us to continue to shed light on these concerning topics and how it is that we can think differently and better about this world and the state that we live in,&#8221; Woodside Bury said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woodside Bury is the 2022 recipient of the UC Santa Cruz Outstanding Staff Award (OSA). The award recognizes staff members who provide distinguished service each day to the students, staff, and faculty of our campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Sarah Woodside Bury has long been a tireless leader and wonderful team player for College Nine and John R. Lewis College, whose generous spirit and deep attention to her work shine through in everything she does,&#8221; noted Division of Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell. &#8220;I'm delighted to see her receive this much-deserved recognition."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Woodside Bury's commitment to our campus, work ethic, and emotional intelligence are unparalleled -- she leads with&#160;heart, intentionality, empathy, care, professionalism, vision and acumen,&#8221; said Flora Lu, provost for Colleges Nine and John R. Lewis. &#8220;A consummate professional who&#160;exemplifies UCSC's&#160;Principles of Community, Woodside Bury is respected across campus. People like her are the&#160;glue in our campus community&#8212;the ones who make the effort and take the time to reach out, pick up the phone, meet up and pitch in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woodside Bury started her work at UCSC in 2001 as the coordinator for residential education at College Nine and then transitioned to college programs coordinator for College Nine and College Ten. Three years later she moved to Crown College as the associate director and in 2010 returned to Colleges Nine and Ten in the same position. Woodside Bury also served as the interim program director of the College Housing and Educational Services (CHES) Student Diversity and Inclusion Program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What I love about my job is that I work with students who are at the very beginning of their college experience all the way through to commencement. I get to see that trajectory and the changes they go through and the learning that takes place. I feel lucky to get to witness and be a part of that,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of that work, Woodside Bury stepped away to start a floating international study abroad university called The Scholar Ship where she was the intercultural residential counselor-coordinator. A year later she returned to UC Santa Cruz and the associate director position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Woodside Bury was selected senior director, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-leading the four colleges with the provosts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Flora Lu; Alan Christy, provost of Cowell College; and Matt O&#8217;Hara, provost of Stevenson College. She supports the overall theme of each college - international global perspectives, social justice and community, the pursuit of truth in the company of friends, and self and society &#8211; through her duties that range from business administration, finance, and logistics to philosophical and curricular approaches. Working from a holistic student viewpoint, Woodside Bury moves the academic lessons from the classroom into daily life, creating opportunities that transform students into leaders and changemakers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My job is on the student life side, taking the themes introduced in the core course and bringing them to life outside the classroom,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Woodside Bury's passion for working with and supporting students shines in the programs she creates and nurtures,&#8221; said Alex Belisario,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">executive director of College Student Life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Her influence is seen in the thousands of students' lives she has touched, staff and faculty connections she has maintained, and her continued work to create a more just and equitable world. She is so deserving of this award!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Outstanding Staff Award&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more than two and a half decades, the Staff Advisory Board (SAB), UCSC Alumni Association and the Chancellor&#8217;s Office have worked together to honor a member of the staff through the annual Outstanding Staff Award. Nominations are solicited across campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The award is an opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of all of our great staff,&#8221; said Ryan Ervin, chair elect of the SAB. &#8220;It is an honor to serve on the OSA committee, read through all the nominees and learn how these members go above and beyond for our campus community. Selecting a winner is no easy task.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>John R. Lewis College Dedication</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woodside Bury played a leading role working with emeritus professor of sociology and civil rights activist John Brown Childs, Provost Lu, and others for more than a year on the naming and dedication of College Ten as the John R. Lewis College. &#8220;With intentionality and sensitivity, we reached out to those close to John Lewis to humbly ask for their permission for this naming,&#8221; said Woodside Bury. &#8220;We are committed to forging longstanding and meaningful connections with his community and constituency." Woodside Bury explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is both an honor and a responsibility. He held both the steadfast commitment to civil rights and social justice and equity while also bringing his whole human self to the table always &#8211; building that community, building rapport, and building bridges.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean Mitchell emphasized that Woodside Bury&#8217;s &#8220;efforts were critical in this year's dedication of John R. Lewis College, and she remains a strong advocate in continued efforts to help the college live up to Lewis' legacy."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This work, along with her formidable workload during the pandemic, were highlighted when she received the Division of Social Science&#8217;s Outstanding Staff Award in June.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Outstanding Colleagues</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woodside Bury says her successes are possible because of the outstanding staff members who work with her taking ideas, visions, and plans and putting them into practice. &#8220;I see the commitment of our incredibly dedicated staff who work tirelessly to create the kinds of communities where students feel safe, comfortable and whole. I'm so grateful to my staff in particular. This award is for everyone that supports me. I wouldn't be here if it weren&#8217;t for them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Woodside Bury has functioned as the compass by which our department makes sense of our work and has done so while maintaining a transparent, honest, diligent, and hardworking pace,&#8221; said Alec Santos, assistant director for residential education at John R. Lewis College. &#8220;Woodside Bury makes me feel heard, seen, understood, challenged, and inspired to do better for myself and for my team. I have never in my career worked in an environment where I felt any of those, so I am so overwhelmingly grateful for her and all she does.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woodside Bury&#8217;s gratitude reaches beyond the people she works with each day. &#8220;I think about all the unseen, often unnoticed staff who are extremely dedicated and committed, who work day in and day out to support our campus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Always learning</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with Woodside Bury&#8217;s heavy workload, she continues to find the time to grow her knowledge. &#8220;I&#8217;m a learner. I hope that I'm constantly in a state of learning and broadening my understanding and perspective.&#8221; She has completed the UCSC </span><a href="https://diversity.ucsc.edu/education/certificate_program/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity and Inclusion Certificate Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://sustainability.ucsc.edu/engage/Sustainability%20Certificate%20Program/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustainability Certificate Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and was named a Sustainability Champion of the Month in June by the Sustainability Office. Woodside Bury has also participated in the </span><a href="https://sjti.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Justice Training Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other workshops and conferences outside UCSC with themes of intercultural education and social justice education.</span></p>
<p><strong>Journey ahead</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each time she walks into the Cowell College courtyard, Woodside Bury feels the support of the campus and its familiar surroundings. The world begins to open as she makes her way onto the patio and looks across East Field into Monterey Bay.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I continue to be motivated by this driving force of positive change at a time when it is so critically needed. The beauty of this place and the people here sustain and inspire me in my ongoing commitment to make the world a more socially just, sustainable and inclusive place.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="33e993ad807270465a2acc6a36ab5c4e"><name>move-in-traffic-impacts</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Campus plan for transportation, parking, and traffic impacts during move-in</title><summary>Move-in will take place starting Thursday, Sept. 15 and concluding Wednesday, Sept. 21, and will create a number of transportation, parking, and traffic impacts</summary><start-date>1662966000000</start-date><display-name>Campus plan for transportation, parking, and traffic impacts during move-in</display-name><path>/2022/09/move-in-traffic-impacts</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/09/move-in-traffic-impacts</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1663023289219</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1663023289219</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong><em>Para leer este mensaje en espa&#241;ol, haga <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/move-in-transportation-parking-traffic.html%23spanish&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1663105926612000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2jO2oWreosWNjeItd3n4dl" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/move-in-transportation-parking-traffic.html#spanish" rel="noopener" target="_blank">clic aqu&#237;</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is preparing to welcome more than 9,000 residential students to our community this week. Move-in will take place starting Thursday, Sept. 15 and concluding Wednesday, Sept. 21, and will create a number of transportation, parking, and traffic impacts.</p>

<p>La UC Santa Cruz se est&#225; preparando para darle la bienvenida a m&#225;s de 9,000 estudiantes residenciales a nuestra comunidad esta semana. La mudanza tendr&#225; lugar a partir del jueves, 15 de septiembre y concluir&#225; el mi&#233;rcoles 21 de septiembre, y esto tendr&#225; unos cuantos impactos en cuanto al transporte, estacionamientos y tr&#225;nsito.</p>

National HSI week recognizes the 559 HSIs throughout the nation for their work and critical role in educating and empowering Hispanic youth. Through a series of campus programs, social media campaigns, and community efforts, HSIs will use this week </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to bring awareness to the important roles they have in improving access to education and advancing equity for traditionally underserved students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because this year&#8217;s National HSI week coincides with UCSC move-in, the UC Santa Cruz </span><a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HSI Initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team partnered with the </span><a href="https://elcentro.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicanx Latinx Resource Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, better known as El Centro, to curate a series of in-person, virtual, and social media engagement opportunities for the campus community. These events (listed below) are intended to highlight what it means for UCSC to be an HSI and the many resources available to undergraduate and graduate students because of the HSI designation and affiliation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s observance of National HSI weeks comes at a special time for the institution&#8217;s HSI initiatives. In June 2022 UC Santa Cruz joined 19 leading universities as founding members of the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/alliance-hispanic-serving-research-universities.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance of Hispanic Serving Research Universities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In October 2021, UC Santa Cruz was also recognized as one of 35 Hispanic-Serving Institutions as a Fulbright HSI Leader because of noteworthy engagement with Fulbright exchange participants during the 2019&#8211;2021 academic years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HSI Initiatives and El Centro provide a multitude of resources and services to UC Santa Cruz undergraduate and graduate students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undergraduate resources and support services include:</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since first becoming an HSI in Fall 2012, UCSC has achieved a number of </span><a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/about/milestones.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">milestones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including growing national recognition and five federal grants totalling over sixteen million dollars. The funding from these awards supports equity and social justice efforts across the university. To that end, the HSI Initiatives team has thus far collaborated with 44 departments to serve 11,677 students, 5,285 of whom were designated EOP and 4,116 of whom identified as Latinx.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If UCSC&#8217;s growth as an HSI over the past ten years is indicative of what&#8217;s yet to come, the university&#8217;s future as an HSI appears to be very bright.</span></p>

We urge all students to be extra vigilant as they search for housing on popular websites.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craigslist is one of the most popular ways for renters to find a place to live. We urge you to be careful as you search. Do as much research as you can on a rental property and the landlord before visiting the unit or signing a rental application.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few tips from the Better Business Bureau and other consumer rights groups on how to avoid rental scams:&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Never provide personal information</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as your Social Security number or bank information upfront in an email or over the phone.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Always meet the landlord in person</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Talking to them over the phone is not sufficient.</span></p>
<p><strong>Never agree to rent a unit before actually seeing the inside</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Don&#8217;t just look at the outside.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Never pay cash or wire money</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pay your rent and deposit with a check in person. Never pay in cash and do not do a wire transfer. Wiring money is like cash and it is almost impossible to get back.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Never feel pressured to sign a rental agreement.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If something doesn&#8217;t feel right, trust your instincts and back out.&#160;</span></p>

former MCD Biology faculty member, Jane Silverthorne, recently passed away.</p>
<p>Dr. Silverthorne, a plant biologist, earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in biology (Hons) from the University of Sussex in Brighton, England, and then went on to earn her Ph.D. from the University of Warwick, where she worked with Professor R. John Ellis in the School of Biological Sciences. Dr. Silverthorne subsequently did postdoctoral work with Elaine Tobin at UCLA.&#160; She served as a faculty member at UC Santa Cruz from 1987 to 2004, rising to the rank of full professor.</p>
<p>In 1999, Dr. Silverthorne took a temporary leave from UCSC so that she could serve as a rotating program director at the National Science Foundation. In 2003, she accepted a permanent program director position at the NSF managing the Plant Genome Program. From November 2006 to March 2008, Dr. Silverthorne served in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy as a Senior Policy Analyst in the Life Sciences. Upon her return to the NSF, Dr. Silverthorne served in increasingly senior roles. From 2014 until her retirement in 2017, Dr. Silverthorne was the deputy assistant director for the Biological Sciences Directorate. More recently, Dr. Silverthorne served as a senior scientific advisor for the Supporters of Agricultural Research (SoAR) Foundation and on the Board of Directors at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research.</p>
<p>Dr. Silverthorne was a respected scientist and a leader and champion for the development of the plant genomics field and community. She was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2012 and was the 2020 recipient of the American Society of Plant Biology Leadership in Science Public Service Award. She was a cheerful colleague who was always willing to provide help and advice. She will be missed by all who knew her.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Grant Hartzog, Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="41e08664807270465a2acc6a5f1cd541"><name>cystinosin</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Study reveals the molecular origin of the genetic disease cystinosis </title><summary>New understanding of how the transporter protein cystinosin functions may lead to better treatments for a devastating genetic disease.</summary><keywords>Glenn Millhauser</keywords><start-date>1663225200000</start-date><display-name>Study reveals the molecular origin of the genetic disease cystinosis </display-name><path>/2022/09/cystinosin</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/09/cystinosin</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1663257577041</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1663352918047</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/tufa-assafa-390.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/tufa-assafa-390.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tufa-assafa-390.jpg</name><display-name>tufa-assafa-390.jpg</display-name><file-size>99938</file-size><width>390</width><height>405</height></image><image-alt>Tufa Assafa</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/tufa-assafa-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/tufa-assafa-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tufa-assafa-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>tufa-assafa-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16971</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Tufa Assafa</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Tufa Assafa, a postdoctoral researcher in Glenn Millhauser&#8217;s lab at UCSC, led an analysis of the molecular mechanisms of the protein involved in cystinosis, a rare genetic disease.

A team of scientists has now solved the structure of cystinosin and determined how mutations interfere with its normal function, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms and suggesting a way to develop new treatments for the disease.</p>
<p>The new study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.08.020"><em>published September 15 in Cell</em></a>, involved a collaborative effort by researchers at UC Santa Cruz, Stanford University, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, who combined their expertise in three specialized methods for studying protein structure and function: x-ray crystallography, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and double electron-electron resonance (DEER).</p>
<p>&#8220;This paper could set a model for how to combine those three areas, along with biochemical assays, to quickly narrow in on how a protein functions and identify a therapeutic strategy,&#8221; said Glenn Millhauser, distinguished professor and chair of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz and a corresponding author of the paper.</p>
<p>Cystinosin is a specialized transporter protein that plays a crucial role in how cells manage the essential amino acid cysteine. Cells are constantly recycling proteins, breaking them down into their constituent amino acids for use in building new proteins. Transporters like cystinosin move the amino acids out of lysosomes&#8212;the cellular compartments where proteins are broken down&#8212;into the cell to be reused. When cystinosin isn&#8217;t functioning properly due to mutations, a form of cysteine (a dimer called cystine) builds up inside the lysosomes.</p>
<p>The abnormal accumulation of cystine causes widespread damage to tissues and organs and can lead to kidney failure, muscle wasting, and other problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a rare disease, but it can be deadly,&#8221; Millhauser said. &#8220;If it&#8217;s untreated, people with cystinosis usually die by age ten.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cystinosin adopts different conformations when it is open to the inside of the lysosome to load cystine and when it is open to the outside to release cystine. The research teams at Stanford (led by Professor Liang Feng) and at UT Southwestern (led by Professor Xiaochun Li) solved the structures of cystinosin in these different structural conformations using x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM.</p>
<p>Understanding cystinosin&#8217;s structural changes through the transport process, however, required the DEER studies performed by Millhauser&#8217;s lab. DEER is a specialized magnetic resonance technique that can be used to determine how a protein changes its shape.</p>
<p>&#8220;With that we were able to figure out the mechanism that allows cystinosin to switch between those different states, and we could narrow in on which of the protein&#8217;s amino acids were driving the transition,&#8221; Millhauser said. &#8220;Now we can see how the mutations are changing the protein&#8217;s ability to change shape and pump cystine out of the lysosome.&#8221;</p>
<p>These new insights into the molecular mechanics of cystinosin&#8217;s transport activity not only provide a more detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of cystinosis, but also suggest a possible therapeutic strategy to treat the disease. &#8220;It may be possible to enhance the transport activity of cystinosin by developing conformation-selective small molecules or biologics that favor a cytosol-open conformation,&#8221; the authors wrote.</p>
<p>A similar approach could be used to target other transporter proteins, which are involved in a wide range of diseases.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The inaugural program, called the Genome Research Experiences to Attract Talented Undergraduates into the Genomics Field to Enhance Diversity (GREAT) program, was established to provide students from diverse backgrounds opportunities to conduct research and receive career training from large, research-intensive schools.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CSUMB and UPRRP were selected to receive a total of $3.35 million over five years to support their students&#8217; participation in this program. UC Santa Cruz, which is also a hispanic-serving institution, is the only university that will partner with both of the funded institutions.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CSUMB&#8217;s program, under the leadership of Associate Professor Nathaniel Jue and Assistant Professor Shahidul Islam, is partnered exclusively with UCSC and will send about six students per year to UC Santa Cruz. Students from UPRRP, where the program will be led by Professor Jos&#233; Garc&#237;a-Arrar&#225;s, will have the opportunity to conduct research at several other universities, which will include one to two students at UCSC per year.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The visiting students will participate in a paid summer internship program in which they contribute directly to research in labs associated with the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute. During the summer session, they will conduct research, build relationships with faculty and staff, explore whether they might want to pursue graduate research at UCSC, learn about science communication, and participate in career development workshops to prepare for graduate school and industry.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We take a lot of pride in the fact that when our students leave here, they know that they've actually contributed to research,&#8221; said Zia Isola, Director of the UCSC Genomics Institute Office of Diversity Programs and main architect of the UCSC summer program. &#8220;In some cases, that research will continue into the academic year and beyond, and the students will continue to contribute data and sometimes even be included as authors on publications.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This new program follows UCSC and CSUMB&#8217;s successful collaboration during a similar National Institutes of Health program called the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative, which was a five-year program focused on training students in the field of computational genomics that ran from 2015 to 2020. From that experience, Isola said the UCSC Genomics Institute gained an increased focus on making sure the labs&#8217; principal investigators, postdocs, and graduate students are trained in inclusive pedagogy and are prepared to provide the best mentorship they can for visiting students. They also aim to emphasize cultivating a sense of belonging and strengthening the students&#8217; science identities.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Virtually all of the students who participate in this will be first-generation college students from underrepresented populations, who may not have seen role models that look like them, so it's not always easy to feel that sense of belonging,&#8221; Isola said. &#8220;We want them to come away with that feeling of, &#8216;I do belong here, and if I choose this as my career path, it's something that's completely accessible to me.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="434d2f72807270465a2acc6ae5323f0c"><name>antarctic-ice-sheet</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Record of Antarctic ice sheet response to climate cycles found in rock samples</title><summary>The effects of global climate cycles on Southern Ocean temperatures drove cycles of melting and freezing in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet every few thousand years, according to a new study.</summary><keywords>Terry Blackburn, Slawek Tulaczyk, Gavin Piccione</keywords><start-date>1663225200000</start-date><display-name>Record of Antarctic ice sheet response to climate cycles found in rock samples</display-name><path>/2022/09/antarctic-ice-sheet</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/09/antarctic-ice-sheet</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1663281475423</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1663286498841</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/ma113-2views-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/ma113-2views-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ma113-2views-400.jpg</name><display-name>ma113-2views-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>69191</file-size><width>400</width><height>225</height></image><image-alt>two views of a rock sample</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/blood-falls-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/blood-falls-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>blood-falls-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>blood-falls-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19108</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Blood Falls</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UCSC researchers analyzed two rock samples collected in Eastern Antarctica in which alternating layers of calcite and opal reflect cyclic changes in the subglacial environment.

<p>The East Antarctic Ice Sheet is the world&#8217;s largest ice mass. Understanding its sensitivity to climate change is crucial for efforts to project how much sea level will rise as global temperatures increase. Recent studies suggest it may be more vulnerable to ice loss than previously thought.</p>
<p>The new study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33009-1.epdf">published September 15 in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>, provides evidence of changes at the base of the ice sheet over a broad area in response to cyclic changes in climate during the Pleistocene. The changes are reflected in the types of minerals deposited at the base of the ice sheet.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the key findings is that the ice sheet was responding to temperature changes in the Southern Ocean,&#8221; said coauthor Terrence Blackburn, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;The warm water eats at the edges of the ice sheet and causes the ice to flow faster, and that response reaches deep into the heart of the ice sheet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rock samples analyzed in the study consist of alternating layers of opal and calcite that formed as mineral deposits at the base of the ice sheet, recording cyclic changes in the composition of subglacial fluids.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each layer in these samples is a manifestation of a change at the base of the ice sheet driven by changes in the motion of the ice streams,&#8221; said first author Gavin Piccione, a Ph.D. candidate working with Blackburn at UCSC.</p>
<p>By dating the layers, the researchers found a striking correlation between the layers of mineral deposits and the record of polar sea surface temperatures derived from ice cores. The opal was deposited during cold periods, and the calcite during warm periods.</p>
<p>&#8220;These climate oscillations are causing changes in ice sheet behavior such that the chemistry and hydrology beneath the ice is changing,&#8221; said coauthor Slawek Tulaczyk, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC who has been studying the behavior of ice sheets and glaciers for decades.</p>
<h2>Millennial cycles</h2>
<p>The climate cycles that match the mineral layers are relatively small fluctuations that occur every few thousand years within the more pronounced glacial-interglacial cycles that occurred every 100,000 years or so throughout the Pleistocene. The glacial-interglacial cycles are driven primarily by changes in Earth&#8217;s orbit around the sun. The smaller millennial-scale climate cycles involve oscillations in polar temperatures driven by weakening and strengthening of a major ocean current (the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC) which transports large amounts of heat northward through the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Tulaczyk said the new findings reveal the Antarctic Ice Sheet&#8217;s sensitivity to small, short-term climate fluctuations.</p>
<p>&#8220;As important as the Antarctic Ice Sheet is&#8212;it's responsible for close to 17 meters of sea level rise since the last glacial maximum&#8212;we really know very little about how it has responded to climate variability,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We know the last 20,000 years pretty well, but beyond that we&#8217;ve been almost blind. That&#8217;s why these results are so mind-blowing. People have been banging their heads against the wall over this for decades.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two rock samples analyzed for this study were collected from glacial moraines separated by more than 900 kilometers (560 miles), and they formed over different periods covering a total of more than 100,000 years. In other words, they record similar cycles of mineral deposition beneath the ice occurring over a broad area and over long periods of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chemistry of the two samples matched, even though they came from so far apart, which gave us confidence that some large-scale, systematic process was going on,&#8221; Piccione said.</p>
<h2>Opal and calcite layers</h2>
<p>The mechanism behind the formation of layers of opal and calcite is a bit complicated and requires an understanding of not only mineral chemistry but also the unusual hydrology beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Heat from Earth&#8217;s interior (&#8220;geothermal heating&#8221;) causes melting at the base of the ice sheet, which is insulated from frigid polar temperatures by the thickness of the ice. Where the ice gets thinner toward the margins of the ice sheet, subglacial meltwater begins to refreeze, concentrating dissolved minerals and eventually forming hypersaline brines.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits form as the water becomes concentrated by refreezing, and the first thing to precipitate is calcite, the most common form of calcium carbonate. Opal (amorphous silica) will eventually precipitate from older, supersaturated brines that don&#8217;t have any carbon left in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Antarctica has these interesting brines with no carbon in them, because it all precipitated out earlier, so when those brines are isolated from other sources of water they form opal,&#8221; Piccione explained.</p>
<p>To get a layer of calcite on top of the opal requires an influx of carbon-containing glacial meltwater, which occurs during warm intervals in the climate cycles, when the AMOC slows down. That leads to warming in the Southern Hemisphere and brings warm water into contact with the floating ice shelves at the edges of the ice sheet. As the warm water eats away at the bottom of the ice shelves, the &#8220;grounding line&#8221; where the ice contacts land begins to retreat and ice flows more rapidly from the interior out to the edges.</p>
<p>Tulaczyk explained that the motion of the ice over the bedrock generates heat, increasing the amount of meltwater at the base of the ice sheet. &#8220;If you imagine a map of where there is meltwater under the ice sheet, that area expands in warm periods and contracts in cold periods, like a heartbeat,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The resulting &#8220;freeze-flush cycles&#8221; at the base of the ice account for the alternating layers of opal and calcite in the rocks.</p>
<h2>Southern Ocean temperatures</h2>
<p>The findings point to water temperatures in the Southern Ocean as the main mechanism driving the response of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to changes in the global climate. Temperatures in Antarctica are so cold that a few degrees of warming won&#8217;t cause surface melting of the ice, yet scientists know the ice sheet has melted in the past and parts of it have collapsed, Blackburn said. &#8220;It&#8217;s been hard to understand, but this shows clearly that ocean warming is the driving mechanism,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at the places that are losing ice today, they are concentrated along the edges of the ice sheet where it is in contact with the warming ocean,&#8221; Tulaczyk added. &#8220;The primary driver of ocean warming now is atmospheric carbon dioxide, not the AMOC, but I don&#8217;t think the ice sheet cares what causes the warming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tulaczyk said the findings do show that the ice sheet can retreat during warm periods and then recover during subsequent cooling. &#8220;In the context of the threshold question&#8212;is the ice sheet sitting on a threshold beyond which there would be runaway melting and it will all go&#8212;that&#8217;s not what I see here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The ice is sensitive to these short-term fluctuations, but the magnitude of ice loss is small enough that it can recover with cooling.&#8221;</p>

Though the two areas of study may seem unrelated at a surface level, for Prescod-Weinstein, the two are undoubtedly connected.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was, in fact, her scientific curiosity that drew her to confront the issues of unfairness and representation in academia. Inspired by Stephen Hawking and a desire to write the world&#8217;s next </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Brief History of Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Prescod-Weinstein entered the field of astronomy with an excitement for the sciences and a dream of forging the future of her field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I responded to [the problems of education, physics and astronomy] like I had a test. I wanted to understand: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the bigger story here? Why are these things happening?</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the patterns?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I just naturally look for patterns, like the demographics of who's in the room and who wasn't in the room. For me, part of it was my scientific curiosity about it, and the other piece was feeling angry and frustrated, wanting to do something about it. And so that led me to doing my own reading to do my own self education.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, when Prescod-Weinstein originally planned to write her latest book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Disordered Cosmos</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">; she found herself writing a collection of essays primarily concerning the problems of the astronomy community. The book she wrote was defined by stories of sexual harrassment and the fight to protect Hawaiian sacred land on Mauna Kea&#8212;the location of a national observatory, and the construction site of the Thirty Meter Telescope. Prescod-Weinsten later realized that only one or two chapters about her knowledge of cosmology and relativity had made it into the book &#8211; a realization that truly showed her how much of her passion had been suppressed by the hostile environment she worked in.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As I sat down to write, it became clear that I couldn't, it couldn't allow that to be the totality of the book. I needed the book to reflect the things that I dream and the parts of those dreams that I got to live.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Prescod-Weinstein graduated from high school, she dreamed that her first book would be the next </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Brief History of Time, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but in her writing, she found herself talking not of the beauty of cosmology, but of her own disappointment in the field&#8217;s reality. It was in this disappointment that she realized that just as her scientific passion led her to exploring the dark side of the sciences, her need to illuminate the shortcomings of cosmology needed the context of her own excitement for the field. Her book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Disordered Cosmos: A Journey into Dark Matter, Spacetime, and Dreams Deferred,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creates a holistic look at the field of cosmology, both in its wonder and in its failures &#8211; with its very subtitle highlighting how her hopes of writing a book on exclusively cosmology where forced away by the injustice in her field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In many ways, the book represents a dream deferred for me,&#8221; Prescod-Weinstein said. &#8220;Nobody grows up thinking, &#8216;I really want to fight racism in science,&#8217; or &#8216;I really want to be the only Black woman in the room.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Prescod-Weinstein chose to attend UCSC her choice was inspired by the happy academic environment of the Astronomy department, and of the natural environment surrounding the university. While at UCSC, Prescod-Weinstein was one of only ten Black graduate students on campus, but she said the robust academics of the astronomy and astrophysics department kept her motivated to attend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I visited Santa Cruz, the graduate students in the Astronomy Department were happy compared to the other places that I was looking at, Prescod-Weinstein said. &#8220;After four years leave, I wanted to come home [to California] andI wanted to be around people that felt like home for me.I had a good impression of the department&#8211;the astronomy department at UC Santa Cruz is world class! It's the kind of program that if you go there, it rewrites your ticket in a way.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the academic environment at UCSC, Prescod-Weinstein found a nontraditional teacher&#8211;the very trees that dominate the campus.. Growing up in East L.A.,Prescod-Weinstein recalls not having regular access to nature like she did at UCSC, and of the lasting impact that living and learning amidst nature had on her as a scientist, a citizen, and a thinker.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The way that we talk about the redwood tree, we tend not to think of them as teachers or professors, but I think I learned a lot from being in that environment,&#8221; Prescod-Weinstein said. &#8220;There's things that you learn from looking around, like how the pine needles are on the ground, and they just stay there. You learn about resilience, equilibrium with your ecosystem, and all of these things that, unfortunately, are not well transmitted in American culture.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prescod-Weinstein&#8217;s appreciation for UCSC goes beyond just the sum of its parts as well&#8211;she&#8217;s an ardent believer in the power of public education. As a professor at the University of New Hampshire, she continues her mission to support public education in return for how it benefited her own life,and wants to give the same opportunities to the students of the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I was choosing a faculty position, I proactively chose a position at a public university,&#8221; Prescod-Weinstein said. &#8220;I believe in the mission of public education, that all the way through Ph.D., I think that public education is powerful, it is essential, and it should be free. And I decided that's a place where I could fight for public education, as a professor at a public university.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years as a professor, Prescod-Weinstein still knows that students can understand the impact they&#8217;re capable of &#8211; even if they aren&#8217;t always told about it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My favorite thing about UC Santa Cruz and the people that go there, is that the students are always so passionate about the community,&#8221; Prescod-Weinstien said. &#8220;I would say student voices are essential to transforming our world into one where we all survive and thrive.&#8221;</span></p>

The belted giant rotates at a 26.7-degree angle relative to the plane in which it orbits the sun. Astronomers have long suspected that this tilt comes from gravitational interactions with its neighbor Neptune, as Saturn&#8217;s tilt precesses, like a spinning top, at nearly the same rate as the orbit of Neptune.</p>
<p>But a new modeling study by a team of astronomers and planetary scientists has found that, while the two planets may have once been in sync, Saturn has since escaped Neptune&#8217;s pull. What was responsible for this planetary realignment? The team has one meticulously tested hypothesis: a missing moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to figure out the implications of this hypothesis and explore the expected outcomes of a scenario in which an additional moon became destabilized as Titan, Saturn&#8217;s largest moon, migrated outward,&#8221; said Francis Nimmo, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Nimmo and UCSC graduate student Brynna Downey are both coauthors of a paper on the new findings, led by planetary scientist Jack Wisdom at MIT and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn1234">published September 15 in <em>Science</em></a>.</p>
<p>The team proposes that Saturn, which today hosts 83 moons, once harbored at least one more, an extra satellite that they name Chrysalis. Together with its siblings, the researchers suggest, Chrysalis orbited Saturn for several billion years, pulling and tugging on the planet in a way that kept its tilt, or &#8220;obliquity,&#8221; in resonance with Neptune.</p>
<p>But around 160 million years ago, the team estimates, Chrysalis became unstable and came too close to its planet in a grazing encounter that pulled the satellite apart. The loss of the moon was enough to remove Saturn from Neptune&#8217;s grasp and leave it with the present-day tilt.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the researchers surmise, while most of Chrysalis&#8217; shattered body may have made impact with Saturn, a fraction of its fragments could have remained suspended in orbit, eventually breaking into small icy chunks to form the planet&#8217;s signature rings.</p>
<p>The missing satellite, therefore, could explain two longstanding mysteries: Saturn&#8217;s present-day tilt and the age of its rings, which were previously estimated to be about 100 million years old &#8212; much younger than the planet itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like a butterfly&#8217;s chrysalis, this satellite was long dormant and suddenly became active, and the rings emerged,&#8221; Wisdom said.</p>
<p>The study&#8217;s co-authors also include Rola Dbouk at MIT, Burkhard Militzer at UC Berkeley, William Hubbard at the University of Arizona, and Richard French at Wellesley College.</p>
<p><strong>A moment of progress</strong></p>
<p>In the early 2000s, scientists put forward the idea that Saturn&#8217;s tilted axis is a result of the planet being trapped in a resonance, or gravitational association, with Neptune. But observations taken by NASA&#8217;s Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, put a new twist on the problem. Scientists found that Titan, Saturn&#8217;s largest satellite, was migrating away from Saturn at a faster clip than expected, at a rate of about 11 centimeters per year. Titan&#8217;s fast migration, and its gravitational pull, led scientists to conclude that the moon was likely responsible for tilting and keeping Saturn in resonance with Neptune.</p>
<p>But this explanation hinges on one major unknown: Saturn&#8217;s moment of inertia, which is how mass is distributed in the planet&#8217;s interior. Saturn&#8217;s tilt could behave differently, depending on whether matter is more concentrated at its core or toward the surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make progress on the problem, we had to determine the moment of inertia of Saturn,&#8221; Wisdom said.</p>
<p><strong>The lost element</strong></p>
<p>In the new study, the researchers looked to pin down Saturn&#8217;s moment of inertia using some of the last observations taken by Cassini in its &#8220;Grand Finale,&#8221; a phase of the mission during which the spacecraft made an extremely close approach to precisely map the gravitational field around the entire planet. The gravitational field can be used to determine the distribution of mass in the planet.</p>
<p>Wisdom and his colleagues modeled the interior of Saturn and identified a distribution of mass that matched the gravitational field that Cassini observed. Surprisingly, they found that this newly identified moment of inertia placed Saturn close to, but just outside the resonance with Neptune. The planets may have once been in sync, but are no longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we went hunting for ways of getting Saturn out of Neptune&#8217;s resonance,&#8221; Wisdom says.</p>
<p>The team first carried out simulations to evolve the orbital dynamics of Saturn and its moons backward in time, to see whether any natural instabilities among the existing satellites could have influenced the planet&#8217;s tilt. This search came up empty.</p>
<p>So, the researchers reexamined the mathematical equations that describe a planet&#8217;s precession, which is how a planet&#8217;s axis of rotation changes over time. One term in this equation has contributions from all the satellites. The team reasoned that if one satellite were removed from this sum, it could affect the planet&#8217;s precession.</p>
<p>The question was, how massive would that satellite have to be, and what dynamics would it have to undergo to take Saturn out of Neptune&#8217;s resonance?</p>
<p>The team ran simulations to determine the properties of a satellite, such as its mass and orbital radius, and the orbital dynamics that would be required to knock Saturn out of the resonance.</p>
<p>They concluded that Saturn&#8217;s present tilt is the result of the resonance with Neptune and that the loss of the satellite, Chrysalis, which was about the size of Iapetus, Saturn&#8217;s third-largest moon, allowed it to escape the resonance.</p>
<p>Sometime between 200 and 100 million years ago, Chrysalis entered a chaotic orbital zone, experienced a number of close encounters with Iapetus and Titan, and eventually came too close to Saturn, in a grazing encounter that ripped the satellite to bits, leaving a small fraction to circle the planet as a debris-strewn ring.</p>
<p>The loss of Chrysalis, they found, explains Saturn&#8217;s precession, and its present-day tilt, as well as the late formation of its rings.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty good story, but like any other result, it will have to be examined by others,&#8221; Wisdom says. &#8220;But it seems that this lost satellite was just a chrysalis, waiting to have its instability.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ramirez-Ruiz, who holds the Vera Rubin Presidential Chair for Diversity in Astronomy at UC Santa Cruz, will speak on &#8220;The Lamat Institute: Re-Imagining Leadership and Mentorship in Astronomy.&#8221; This online event in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month will take place on Thursday, October 6, at 11 a.m. Pacific Time. There will also be an informal open meeting with Ramirez-Ruiz from 12:45 to 1:30 p.m.</p>
<p>To watch the lecture, please register in advance at <a href="https://nsf.zoomgov.com/webinar/register/WN_sG2YbtEkThKe8EoNqdv64A">nsf.zoomgov.com/webinar/register/WN_sG2YbtEkThKe8EoNqdv64A</a></p>
<p>According to Ramirez-Ruiz, one of the greatest challenges to the astronomical community has been building environments where people with historically marginalized identities (Black, Indigenous and Latinx) can thrive. This critically limits the pool of innovative minds who may gain exclusive access to cutting-edge research and thus, who can shape the future of the field through transformative science, mentoring, and professional leadership.</p>
<p>The overarching goal of the Lamat Institute, which Ramirez-Ruiz established at UCSC in 2010, has been to invigorate the field through training and workplaces that reflect equity-advancing values and allow the full human diversity of our nation to contribute meaningfully to the field. Cultivating equitable access has allowed the program to dramatically increase equitable participation. Earlier this year, Ramirez-Ruiz was honored by the White House with a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring.</p>
<p>In his talk, he will discuss Lamat's mentoring philosophy and design principles, give a broad overview of the program activities, and talk about how the program continuously works to modernize its core structures.</p>
<p>Since joining the UCSC faculty in 2007, Ramirez-Ruiz has won multiple awards for his research, including a Packard Fellowship, the NSF CAREER Award, the Radcliffe Fellowship at Harvard, the Niels Bohr Professorship from the Danish National Research Foundation, the HEAD Mid-Career Prize from the American Astronomical Society, and the Bouchet Award and the Dwight Nicholson Medal from the American Physical Society.&#160; He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. As the director of the Lamat Institute, he works vigorously to support the promotion and retention of women and historically marginalized students in STEM.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>10-07-2022</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="566d1552807270465a2acc6a4defc345"><name>campus-counsel-announcement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Lorena Peñaloza to join UC Riverside as chief campus counsel</title><summary>I am sharing the bittersweet news that Lorena Peñaloza has accepted an offer to serve as the chief campus counsel for UC Riverside. &#13;

<p>I am sharing the bittersweet news that Lorena Pe&#241;aloza has accepted an offer to serve as the chief campus counsel for UC Riverside.</p>
<p>Since joining UC Santa Cruz in 2017, Lorena has provided our campus with clear and thoughtful legal guidance, always offered in the best interests of our university. I have deeply valued her counsel and know that she has partnered with many senior leaders and others across campus to inform and help guide many important decisions. She has also been a great leader and mentor, building a talented team of attorneys and other legal staff.</p>
<p>I appreciate Lorena&#8217;s willingness to continue serving our campus through the end of the calendar year, and we are working with the UC Office of General Counsel to identify an interim leader to serve until we complete a recruitment for Lorena&#8217;s successor.</p>
<p>Please join me in thanking Lorena for her service to UC Santa Cruz and congratulating her on this new opportunity.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>Cindy</p>

She will also hold the title of senior diversity officer for the Division of University Relations.</p>
<p>In this re-envisioned role, Harrell will lead the administrative and operational structure of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation and its Board of Trustees and advance divisional diversity, equity, and inclusion aspirations both in its work environment and its engagement with stakeholders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adrienne&#8217;s breadth and depth of experiences in DEI, fundraising, volunteer engagement, and learning and development make her uniquely qualified for this critical position,&#8221; said Vice Chancellor for University Relations Mark Delos Reyes Davis, who also serves as the foundation&#8217;s president. &#8220;The integration of these responsibilities will fundamentally transform how we do our work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The foundation works in close partnership with Chancellor Cynthia Larive and other university leaders to steward and advance private philanthropic support for the campus mission while fostering greater understanding throughout the broader community and state of UCSC's activities and impact. It provides stewardship for the $156 million endowment, a collection of philanthropic funds created to support the university&#8217;s mission. The foundation&#8217;s endowment, coupled with the campus&#8217;s endowment held with the UC Regents, makes up the total endowment support received from philanthropy to support the long-term advancement of the UC Santa Cruz campus.</p>
<p>Over the past twenty-five years, Harrell has served in a variety of roles at UCSC, including most recently assistant dean in the Humanities Division and director of Undergraduate Student Affairs in Baskin School of Engineering for 10 years and MESA Schools Program director. Before serving as the deputy director of the Center for the Future of Teaching and Learning, she spent three years in University Relations as director and assistant director of Development for Student Affairs and the Natural Sciences Division respectively.</p>
<p>During her tenure managing Learning and Talent Development in Staff Human Resources, Harrell rebuilt and revitalized campus-wide learning and professional development programs for the campus. She led the effort to expand talent development and succession planning capacity as a trained facilitator, collaborating with University Relations in the pilot program for the campus.</p>
<p>A donor, volunteer, and mentor for UCSC, Harrell has developed lasting relationships and deep knowledge of the campus. She will begin her work on September 26. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="60a9d3f4807270465a2acc6a70088a27"><name>rca-naming-dolores-huerta</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz’s Research Center for the Americas to be named in honor of Dolores Huerta</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz will rename the Research Center for the Americas, which is celebrating 30 years of groundbreaking research, in honor of social justice icon Dolores Huerta, whose legacy has influenced the center’s work and values. </summary><start-date>1663743600000</start-date><path>/2022/09/rca-naming-dolores-huerta</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/09/rca-naming-dolores-huerta</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1663774086103</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1665678913411</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Research</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Abby Butler</name><title></title><phone/><email>ajbutler@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/dd8a3285a3_dolores_signature-image-e1555783167922.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/dd8a3285a3_dolores_signature-image-e1555783167922.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dd8a3285a3_dolores_signature-image-e1555783167922.jpg</name><display-name>dd8a3285a3_dolores_signature-image-e1555783167922.jpg</display-name><file-size>44533</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/huerta_450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/huerta_450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>huerta_450.jpg</name><display-name>huerta_450.jpg</display-name><file-size>9421</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huerta is the founder and president of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolores Huerta Foundation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and, in 1962, co-founded the United Farm Workers with Cesar Chavez.

The Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas &#8212; the name will become official next month &#8212; has a long history of working to drive positive social change and continues to innovate and build relationships in service of this goal. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This renaming is a wonderful opportunity for us to recognize Dolores Huerta&#8217;s incredible legacy and to institutionalize it at a moment in time when the political tides seek to diminish leaders like Huerta,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;By permanently enshrining her name at UC Santa Cruz, our faculty, staff, and students, who are the next generation of change-makers, will be inspired by Huerta for years to come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huerta is the founder and president of the </span><a href="https://doloreshuerta.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolores Huerta Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and, in 1962, co-founded the United Farm Workers with Cesar Chavez. Huerta has spent more than 60 years leading community organizing and lobbying efforts to address issues like labor rights, gender discrimination, voter registration, education reform, LGBTQ rights, and economic inequality on behalf of farm workers, immigrants, women, youth, and others in California and the United States. She has received numerous national awards and recognitions for her work, including from the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Women&#8217;s Hall of Fame, and the U.S. Department of Labor Hall of Honor. President Bill Clinton honored her with the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award, and in 2012, President Barack Obama presented Huerta with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, recognizing her as &#8220;one of America&#8217;s great labor and civil rights icons&#8221; who has &#8220;devoted her life to advocating for marginalized communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Dolores Huerta is a visionary leader and organizer. Whether she's building community, overcoming barriers, or speaking truth to power, Huerta is a true inspiration in every way,&#8221; said Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, Research Center for the Americas (RCA) director and associate professor of Latin American and Latino Studies. &#8220;Renaming a University of California research center that focuses on issues and causes that matter to Dolores Huerta is a way to express our collective gratitude for the sacrifices she has made as an activist."</span></p>
<p><strong>A groundbreaking research center</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supported by the Division of Social Sciences, the RCA is the first research center in the UC system to combine perspectives from the traditionally disconnected fields of Latinx ethnic studies and Latin American area studies. Over the past three decades, the center has sponsored groundbreaking research on the experiences of Latinx people in the United States and the social, political, economic, and environmental forces shaping Latin America, including migration, human rights, and civic engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally important, the center has built a vibrant community around this work through public outreach and hands-on research and mentorship for students, many of whom are from underrepresented groups or are the first in their families to attend college. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a first-generation college graduate of UC Santa Cruz, I am very excited to hear the campus is renaming the Research Center for the Americas in honor of Dolores Huerta,&#8221; said Reyna Grande, award-winning author and UCSC alumna. &#8220;She is a fearless leader and a trailblazer in the Latinx community.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lalo Alcaraz, an award-winning cartoonist and artist, and a thought leader on Latinx issues, was also enthusiastic about the center&#8217;s naming in honor of Huerta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dolores Huerta embodies strength, power, and ethical leadership. She has broken barriers and glass ceilings and inspired millions with her slogan of &#8216;S&#237;, se puede,&#8217;&#8221; said Alcaraz. &#8220;UC Santa Cruz being the first to rename a research center in her honor is a groundbreaking idea.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>A shared focus on student empowerment</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students and faculty at the RCA have long been inspired by Huerta&#8217;s impact as an organizer, civil rights activist, feminist, and advocate for Latinx communities. Naming the center for Huerta will inspire students and faculty at the RCA and beyond to continue pushing for positive social change around the most pressing issues facing Latinx communities today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huerta shares the focus of the RCA and UC Santa Cruz on student empowerment and success. She has a background as an educator, is a former UC Regent, and advocates for educational equity through the Dolores Huerta Foundation (DHF). Naming the RCA for Huerta recognizes her impact as a pathbreaking leader in all of these areas, reaffirms the center&#8217;s commitment to the values she embodies, and dedicates the center&#8217;s future work in her honor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a campus, UC Santa Cruz is focused on educational equity and providing an unparalleled educational experience that supports students while they&#8217;re earning a degree and positions them for success when they graduate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A designated Hispanic-Serving Institution, UC Santa Cruz joined other leading universities </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/alliance-hispanic-serving-research-universities.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to form the Alliance of Hispanic Serving Research Universities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a coalition of 21 research universities that aims to increase opportunity for those historically underserved by higher education. UC Santa Cruz is one of only six universities that is both a Hispanic-Serving Institution and a member of the Association of American Universities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Charting a course for the future</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas will be expanding its programs in ways that align with and honor Huerta&#8217;s legacy. The center is launching a fundraising initiative in support of those efforts, including a </span><a href="https://crowdfund.ucsc.edu/project/33156"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crowdfunding campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with $50,000 in matching funds donated by The Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC is also working with Huerta and the Dolores Huerta Foundation to build a meaningful and lasting partnership. The first proposed collaboration is a multi-year endeavor to continue the initial work already started by Huerta and DHF to establish Huerta&#8217;s archives for public access. The renaming of the RCA and UCSC's supportive role in establishing Huerta&#8217;s archives will further cement her legacy for generations to come.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evacuation drills will be conducted between Sept. 26-29, 2022. On Tuesday, Sept. 27, evacuation drills will be taking place at College Nine, John R. Lewis College, Rachel Carson College, and Oakes College.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building occupants are required by law to evacuate the building when the fire alarm sounds or when directed to do so by emergency responders.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some instructions for how to navigate the evacuation drills:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the sounding of a fire alarm or other evacuation alarm, all building occupants shall immediately leave the building and proceed to the area indicated on the posted evacuation directions. Occupants will only be allowed to return when the building has been declared safe by emergency responders.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Evacuating Your Building or Work Area:</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay calm. Do not rush or panic.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safely stop your work.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gather your personal belongings if it is safe to do so. Take prescription medications, keys, purse, glasses, etc. with you if at all possible as it may be hours before you are allowed back into the building.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If safe, close your office door and window, but do not lock them.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the nearest safe stairs and proceed to the nearest exit. Do not use the elevator.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proceed to the designated evacuation meeting point.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait for instructions from emergency responders.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not re-enter the building or work area until you have been instructed to do so by emergency responders.</span></li>
</ul>

In a closing plenary session, Miga joined former President Bill Clinton, U2 lead singer Bono, and Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Ghebreyesus to talk about the greatest health challenges and opportunities the world is currently facing.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miga spoke on her achievements co-leading the Telomere-to-Telomere consortium to <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/t2t-genome.html?utm_medium=rss"><span class="s2">fully sequence a human genome</span></a>, finally completing the human genome project that was funded &#8211; and thought complete &#8211; during the Clinton administration. She explained the landmark scientific feat by comparing the human genome to the book of life, and her work as reading the final missing chapter, with information to help us understand human health, evolution, and the functioning of cells.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In remarks which Bono called &#8220;stunning,&#8221; she discussed the pioneering work done at UC Santa Cruz to <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/08/nanopore-feature.html"><span class="s2">develop the technology</span></a> that has enabled these new discoveries, and the importance of making sure people around the world have the access, skills, and training to use it, calling access to genomic information a fundamental human right.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It should be humbling to us, as well as incredibly empowering, that these mysteries are being unlocked,&#8221; Clinton said. &#8220;We should all become dedicated to an inclusive approach to biomedical research and its benefits being properly distributed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miga emphasized the need for more equitable genomics research, an effort which she is pioneering through leadership of the ongoing <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/pangenome-project.html"><span class="s2">human pangenome project</span></a>, which aims to create a new reference genome that reflects the diversity of humanity. As the field uses a reference genome to identify variation and create treatments based on those differences, this pangenome effort can make it possible to create precision medicine and treatments designed for the specific needs of populations whose genomic variations were not previously represented in scientific resources.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Having this type of infrastructure and support, which we lack now, could be a new legacy for the future and our children,&#8221; Miga said.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>

<p><strong>From:&#160;</strong>Student Health Services</p>
<p><strong>Subject:&#160;</strong>Welcome to Fall Quarter: Important Reminders from Student Health Services</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Students,&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome! The start of a new academic year is always an exciting time. This year is especially exciting since we are fully back to in-person class instruction. Our staff at Student Health Services are looking forward to helping you stay healthy, both mentally and physically, and we&#8217;d like to share a few items that might help you in this goal.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Staying up to date on vaccinations remains the best way to protect yourself against serious complications from COVID-19 and influenza. </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/vaccination_clinic.html"><span>SHS will be offering the new bivalent COVID-19</span></a><span> vaccine as well as the latest quadrivalent (four component) influenza vaccine to our students. In addition, a limited supply of JYNNEOS vaccine for those at high risk for MPX (Monkeypox) is also available. As always, SHS maintains a supply of the routine mandatory vaccinations as well as vaccines for international travel.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Masking:</strong> We have learned over the last few years that masking, especially in indoor spaces or very crowded outdoor events remains an important measure to protect against COVID-19 and has the added benefit of helping prevent the spread of influenza. Free surgical and KN-95 masks are available for pick up at </span><a href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html"><span>various campus locations</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>COVID-19 Testing:</strong> As the pandemic has evolved so have campus testing requirements. The campus continues to offer </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html"><span>free COVID-19 PCR testing</span></a><span> as well as rapid antigen testing, but ongoing asymptomatic testing is no longer required. However, as an important</span><strong> reminder,</strong> <span>the university </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html"><span>requires rapid antigen testing</span></a><span> prior to arrival on campus for all students then a PCR test ASAP within the first week.</span><span> This is one measure that may prevent the rapid spread of illness.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Medical Advice/Appointments:</strong> If you are feeling sick please stay home and do not attend classes or work. SHS has antiviral medications for COVID-19, influenza and MPX that may help lessen your symptoms. Contact our 24/7 nurse advice line for medical questions at 831-459-2591. SHS appointments can be made online via Health e-Messenger or by calling 831-459-2500.&#160;</p>
<p><span><strong>Isolation:</strong> This year, if you have COVID-19 symptoms and test positive, please isolate in place. For more information on how to isolate in place and to keep your roommates healthy, please review our </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-faq.html#positive_housemate"><span>isolation guidelines</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Counseling and Psychological Services:</strong> The pandemic has been hard! Many of you were impacted by the resulting social, emotional, financial and health impacts. CAPS is here to support you. We are committed to providing timely, culturally appropriate, and effective mental health services to all UCSC students. CAPS has a wide range of services to meet your needs. Check us out at </span><a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/"><span>UCSC CAPS</span></a><span>. We&#8217;re here for you.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>

Arredondo, Associate Professor, Latin American and Latino Studies
</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Latin American and Latino Studies Department celebrates the life and legacy of <a href="http://susannejonas.net/index.php">Susanne Jonas</a>, pioneering activist, passionate international advocate for social justice and migrant rights, steadfast critic of U.S. imperialism, dedicated educator, and founding member of our department. She began working as a lecturer at UCSC in 1986, first in the Latin American Studies Program and then in the Latin American and Latino Studies Department. Her courses&#8212;among them, Latin American Politics, Latin American Revolutions, Guatemala War and Peace, U.S. Foreign Policy in Central America, Central American Migrations, and Latin American Social Movements&#8212;testified to the breadth and depth of her expertise and the richness of her lived experience.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in sociology from Radcliffe College/Harvard University, Jonas earned a Master of Arts in Teaching from Harvard, an M.S. in political science from MIT, and a Ph.D. in political science from UC Berkeley. She began her distinguished career working with advocacy research organizations related to Central America, where she witnessed the brutal civil wars of Guatemala and El Salvador. She argued courageously in her writings and elsewhere against inhumane U.S. policies in Central America.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonas wrote and co-edited 22 books and over 100 articles and op-eds, many of which were translated and circulated widely in Latin America and Europe. Her award-winning book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of Centaurs and Doves: Guatemala&#8217;s Peace Process</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Westview Press, 2000; simultaneously published in Spanish), built on her earlier book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Battle for Guatemala: Rebels, Death Squads, and U.S. Power</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Westview Press, 1991; published in Spanish in 1994). The former provides insightful and rigorously researched </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounts of Guatemala&#8217;s historic peace process. Interviewing over a hundred key actors across the political spectrum, Dr. Jonas demonstrated both the significance of that process for the Central American nation and its implications across the hemisphere. She also deployed her transnational lens in her last book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guatemala-U.S. Migration: Transforming Regions</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (University of Texas Press, 2015; published in Spanish in 2018), which she co-authored with Nestor Rodr&#237;guez, another internationally renowned scholar of Guatemalan migration. Recent obituaries in leading Latin American news sources, including </span><a href="https://www.prensacomunitaria.org/2022/09/muere-susanne-jonas-sus-estudios-academicos-y-pasion-por-la-historia-de-guatemala-permaneceran/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prensa Comunitaria</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://elperiodico.com.gt/opiniones/opinion/2022/09/05/susanne-jonas/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">elPeri&#243;dico</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://lahora.gt/opinion/raul/2022/09/02/susanne-jonas-y-guatemala/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Hora</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.prensalibre.com/opinion/columnasdiarias/de-centauros-y-palomas/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prensa Libre</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">speak to her international stature and the respect she earned from the people she loved.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over her </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">illustrious 24-year teaching career at UCSC, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonas infused generations of students and colleagues with her passion for justice and her love for Central America. Current UCSC faculty read her work as graduate students. We were inspired by her rigor, her unflinching analysis of deadly U.S. policies in Latin America, and her bold denunciations of U.S. impunity. Her commitment to her students was legendary.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Serena Rivera (Latin American Studies, 1991) recalled being</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;a bit intimidated by&#8221; Jonas&#8217;s &#8220;powerful presence, but inspired by her passion for human rights, especially Indigenous rights, and her deep belief in the right to self-determination in Latin America.&#8221; Similarly, Laura Chiera (Latin American Studies, 1994) remembered &#8220;being totally captivated&#8221; by Jonas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The class, the subject, and the professor felt alive,&#8221; Chiera said. &#8220;Every historical or political moment was punctuated with a first-hand story of being in the place and experiencing it with key actors.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonas supervised dozens of senior theses on Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and U.S. interventions in Central America. Students cherished her generosity with her time, her active engagement with their work, and her willingness to push them analytically. &#8220;She truly cared about me and helped me see my own potential as a writer and a thinker,&#8221; Rivera recollected.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of Jonas&#8217;s students remain active in social justice advocacy in the Americas and maintained contact with her after graduating from UCSC.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonas was central in the conception and creation of what is now the Latin American and Latino Studies Department at UCSC. She was also an active scholar at UCSC&#8217;s Chicano Latino Research Center, now the Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Am&#233;ricas. Her work illuminated the connections among U.S. intervention in Central America, the civil wars there, the exodus from Central America, and the transformation of the U.S. Latinx population by Central American immigrants. Until recent months, she was writing and speaking on the humanitarian crises and political violence at the Mexico-Guatemala and U.S.-Mexico borders</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and the U.S. government&#8217;s callous responses. Her commitment to social justice and transnational perspectives were and remain at the heart of LALS at UCSC. She has inspired generations of us to continue our research and advocacy for justice and human rights in and beyond the Am&#233;ricas. We are honored and grateful to have learned from, fought alongside, and worked with Susanne Jonas.&#160;</span></p>

class="s1">Seven years ago, Adjunct Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Carlos Maltzahn founded the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://cross.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span class="s2">Center for Research in Open Source Software</span></a> (CROSS) to te</span><span class="s3">ach students how to be productive in open source communities, fund students working on research with a plausible path to becoming a successful open source project, and award fellowships to postdocs to grow open source communities around their research products.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded Maltzahn and CROSS Executive Director Stephanie Lieggi a grant in their inaugural <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22572/nsf22572.htm"><span class="s2">Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems</span></a> (POSE) program to fund organizations to create the support infrastructures necessary for open-source research products to become self-sustaining projects with growing user and contributor communities &#8211; providing a valuable continuation for projects started at CROSS.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;It's one of those things where you work for years on something that was a little crazy and many thought, &#8216;Why would you do this?&#8221; Maltzahn said. &#8220;And then suddenly you find yourself in this amazing center of opportunity.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Full-time students often find that their academic milestones can make it impossible to take on the work of managing and maintaining open source projects, and so many promising research prototypes are abandoned. This grant, called a &#8220;Phase I&#8221; proposal in the POSE program, will allow Maltzahn and Lieggi to develop a plan to recruit research software engineering staff who can, within the university context, establish and maintain the support infrastructure necessary for open source projects to thrive.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The grant funding will specifically support the success of the Skyhook Data Management project, a solution for data storage originally started by CROSS incubator fellow Jeff LeFevre and currently led by computer science and engineering Ph.D. student Jayjeet Chakraborty. Skyhook was <a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/news/skyhookdm-merges-with-apachearrow"><span class="s2">recently integrated into Apache Arrow</span></a>, an industry-leading open source ecosystem for accessing, processing, and communicating large table-based datasets.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Turning Skyhook into a healthy open source project will increase the impact of all the research that has gone into it,&#8221; Maltzahn said. &#8220;The Phase I funding lets us figure out how to create a sustainable model for paying staff in the university context, and making that staff position attractive as a career path.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new grant will fund a series of workshops to look at methodologies and models for building a sustainable open source support infrastructure around Skyhook. Research software engineers will be tasked with bringing industry-level open source practices into Skyhook to ensure high software quality and a compelling experience for users and contributors. They would also be in charge of the community management aspects of the open source project &#8211; mentoring contributors, fielding questions, providing documentation, managing events, and more.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Maltzahn and Lieggi will work with several organizations with years of experience in managing open source ecosystems to develop their plan for sustaining staff, such as the <a href="https://dial.global/"><span class="s2">Digital Impact Alliance</span></a>, a UN foundation organization, as well as the <a href="https://apache.org/"><span class="s2">Apache Software Foundation</span></a> and <a href="https://numfocus.org/"><span class="s2">NUMfocus</span></a>. This will put the team in a great position to respond to the Phase II funding opportunity of the POSE program that, if awarded, would let them implement this plan and hire research software engineers to manage open source project support infrastructures in the long-term.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="67ba7d55807270465a2acc6ac267c987"><name>high-holy-days-message</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Celebrating and observing the Jewish High Holy Days</title><summary>As we welcome the beginning of the academic year, Jewish members of our community will also be ushering in the Jewish new year as they celebrate and observe the High Holy Days.

<p><strong><span>Subject:</span></strong><span> High Holy Days</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span>Hello everyone. </span></p>
<p><span>As we welcome the beginning of the academic year, Jewish members of our community will also be ushering in the Jewish new year as they celebrate and observe the High Holy Days. The High Holy Days take place over the next few weeks and include Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Rosh Hashanah begins at sundown on Sunday, September 25 and continues through Tuesday, September 27 and Yom Kippur begins at sundown on Tuesday, October 4 and ends at sundown on Wednesday, October 5. </span></p>
<p><span>Because the High Holy Days begin so close to the start of a new quarter, it may be challenging for students who observe Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur to figure out how to navigate this with their professors. For those that do observe, I wanted to let you know that all faculty have been emailed about the High Holy Days and have been asked to accommodate students who miss class or need flexibility around assignments.</span></p>
<p><span>It is a good practice to let your professors know ahead of time if you are going to miss class and/or if you need an extension on an assignment related to your celebration and observation of the High Holy Days. </span></p>
<p><span>Shana tova to all who celebrate.</span></p>
<p><span>In community,</span></p>

<p>&#8220;These are prestigious grants, especially for new faculty like Sarah Loerch and Shaun McKinnie, who have each won Early Stage Investigator MIRA awards,&#8221; said department chair Glenn Millhauser, distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nigms.nih.gov/Research/mechanisms/MIRA">National Institute of General Medical Sciences MIRA</a> program provides five-year grants intended to give investigators the stability and flexibility needed to enhance scientific productivity and the chances for important breakthroughs. The program also helps distribute funding more widely among the nation&#8217;s highly talented and promising investigators.</p>
<h2>Protein synthesis</h2>
<p>Loerch&#8217;s research focuses on how cells orchestrate the synthesis of proteins. &#8220;Something that we are just starting to appreciate is that protein synthesis at the right time and in the right place in a cell is crucial for the maintenance of functioning cells,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Every cell has millions of ribosomes, the molecular machines that build proteins, and ribosomes can switch between active and inactive states. Little is known, however, about how cells turn off protein synthesis and reactivate it when and where it&#8217;s needed. Loerch and others have identified a new mechanism used by a protein called eEF2K to shut off the protein synthesis machinery. The new grant will support her efforts to learn more about how this occurs and how cells resume protein expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because protein synthesis is such a fundamental process, eEF2K is likely involved in a range of diseases, such as neurological disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and many others,&#8221; Loerch said. &#8220;Understanding this mechanism could help us think about strategies to correct errors in the many diseases it affects.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Halogenation</h2>
<p>McKinnie&#8217;s lab studies the biosynthesis of biologically significant natural products. His MIRA grant supports a project focusing on the incorporation of halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) into small organic molecules. Conventional organic chemistry strategies for halogenation involve toxic reagents and generate undesirable byproducts, but natural microbial enzymes&#8212;called vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) enzymes&#8212;can incorporate halide ions into organic structures with negligible waste production.</p>
<p>&#8220;We're interested in understanding more about these unusual VHPO enzymes that nature uses to build bioactive natural product compounds,&#8221; McKinnie said.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of VHPO enzymes that catalyze specific halogenation reactions, but only a small fraction of them have been fully characterized. McKinnie will combine interdisciplinary chemical, biochemical, and genomic techniques to identify and characterize novel VHPO enzymes. The project aims to provide new biosynthetic tools for construction of biomedically relevant small molecules and biocatalytic alternatives to conventional organic chemistry halogenation strategies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to know how these enzymes work, what they can do, what kinds of molecules they make in nature, if any of these molecules have useful antibiotic or anticancer activities, and if we can use VHPOs as biocatalysts to make other halogenated molecules,&#8221; McKinnie said.</p>
<h2>Cell cycle</h2>
<p>Rubin studies the biochemical mechanisms that regulate the cell cycle of growth and division, and how this process goes awry in the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tumor cells invariably have defects in the biochemical mechanisms that regulate cell growth and division, so understanding how these processes work is vital to understanding and inhibiting cancer,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The identification of proteins and pathways that regulate the cell&#8217;s decision to divide has led to the development of cell-cycle inhibitors to treat cancer. These drugs have significant shortcomings, however, highlighting the need for a better understanding of cell-cycle control, Rubin said.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;Our research is determining a molecular picture of how proteins control normal and cancer cell proliferation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Rubin&#8217;s lab is studying the structure, function, and regulation of proteins that control the waves of gene expression involved in the cell cycle. The lab uses an integrated approach that combines structural biology with cell-based assays to determine how these proteins interact with each other and with the chromosomes to control gene expression.</p>
<p>The NIGMS MIRA grants for Loerch and McKinnie are both for about $1.9 million over five years; Rubin&#8217;s is for about $2.8 million over five years.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6b06cf38807270465a2acc6af218b919"><name>epigenetic-inheritance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New study shows transmission of epigenetic memory across multiple generations</title><summary>Changing the epigenetic marks on chromosomes leads to altered gene expression in offspring and in grandoffspring, demonstrating ‘transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.’</summary><keywords>Susan Strome</keywords><start-date>1664218800000</start-date><display-name>New study shows transmission of epigenetic memory across multiple generations</display-name><path>/2022/09/epigenetic-inheritance</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/09/epigenetic-inheritance</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1663947951909</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1664218640288</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/embryo-chromosomes-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/embryo-chromosomes-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>embryo-chromosomes-410.jpg</name><display-name>embryo-chromosomes-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>26006</file-size><width>410</width><height>294</height></image><image-alt>C. elegans embryos</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/embryo-chromosomes-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/embryo-chromosomes-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>embryo-chromosomes-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>embryo-chromosomes-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14825</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>chromosomes in embryo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>In a study of epigenetic inheritance, researchers created embryos of the worm C. elegans that inherited egg chromosomes properly packaged with the epigenetic mark H3K27me3 and sperm chromosomes lacking the mark.

The once radical idea that such changes in gene expression can be inherited now has a growing body of evidence behind it, but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>A new study by researchers at UC Santa Cruz shows how a common type of epigenetic modification can be transmitted via sperm not only from parents to offspring, but to the next generation (&#8220;grandoffspring&#8221;) as well. This is called &#8220;transgenerational epigenetic inheritance,&#8221; and it may explain how a person's health and development could be influenced by the experiences of his or her parents and grandparents.</p>
<p>The study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2209471119">published the week of September 26 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em></a>, focused on a particular modification of a histone protein that changes the way DNA is packaged in the chromosomes. This widely studied epigenetic mark (called H3K27me3) is known to turn off or &#8220;repress&#8221; the affected genes and is found in all multicellular animals&#8212;from humans to the nematode worm <em>C. elegans</em> used in this study.</p>
<p>&#8220;These results establish a cause-and-effect relationship between sperm-transmitted histone marks and gene expression and development in offspring and grandoffspring,&#8221; said corresponding author Susan Strome, professor emerita of molecular, cell and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Histones are the main proteins involved in the packaging of DNA in the chromosomes. The epigenetic mark known as H3K27me3 refers to methylation of a particular amino acid in the histone H3. This leads to the DNA being more densely packaged, making the genes in that region less accessible for activation.</p>
<p>The new study involved selectively stripping this histone mark from the chromosomes of <em>C. elegans</em> sperm, which were then used to fertilize eggs with fully marked chromosomes. In the resulting offspring, the researchers observed abnormal gene expression patterns, with genes on the paternal chromosomes (inherited from the sperm) turned on or &#8220;upregulated&#8221; in the absence of the repressive epigenetic mark.</p>
<p>This led to tissues turning on genes they would not normally express. For example, germline tissue (which produces eggs and sperm) turned on genes normally expressed in neurons.</p>
<p>&#8220;In all the tissues we analyzed, genes were aberrantly expressed, but different genes were turned up in different tissues, demonstrating that the tissue context determined which genes were upregulated,&#8221; Strome said.</p>
<p>Analysis of the chromosomes in the offspring&#8217;s germline tissue revealed that the upregulated genes still lacked the repressive histone mark, while the mark had been restored on the genes that were not upregulated.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the germline of the offspring, some genes were aberrantly turned on and stayed in the state lacking the repressive mark, while the rest of the genome regained the mark, and that pattern was passed on to the grandoffspring,&#8221; Strome explained. &#8220;We speculate that if this pattern of DNA packaging is maintained in the germline, it could potentially be passed on for numerous generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the grandoffspring, the researchers observed a range of developmental effects, including some worms that were completely sterile. This mix of outcomes is due to how chromosomes get distributed during the cell divisions that produce sperm and eggs, resulting in many different combinations of chromosomes that can be passed on to the next generation.</p>
<p>Researchers in Strome&#8217;s lab have been studying epigenetic inheritance in <em>C. elegans</em> for years, and she said this paper represents the culmination of their work in this area. She noted that other researchers studying mammalian cells in culture have reported results very similar to her lab&#8217;s findings in worms, although those studies did not show transmission across multiple generations.</p>
<p>&#8220;This looks like a conserved feature of gene expression and development in animals, not just a weird worm-specific phenomenon,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We can do amazing genetic experiments in <em>C. elegans</em> that can&#8217;t be done in humans, and the results of our experiments in worms can have broad implications in other organisms.&#8221;</p>
<p>The co-first authors of the paper are Kiyomi Kaneshiro, who worked on the study as a graduate student in Strome&#8217;s lab and is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, and UCSC research associate Thea Egelhofer. The coauthors also include bioinformaticist Andreas Rechtsteiner and graduate student Chad Cockrum (now at IDEXX Laboratories).

From left to right: Greg Gewickey, stategic advisor; Ash Robbins, CTO; Max Kuznetsov, integrations engineer; Sean Wells, physical therapy advisor; Mike Powell, CEO; Aviv Elor, CRO;&#160;Sri Kurniawan, UX advisor and UCSC professor; and Mircea Teodorescu, engineering advisor and UCSC professor&#160;</div></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating values of tech for social good, inclusivity, and accessibility, three UC Santa Cruz alumni founded Immergo Labs to develop the world&#8217;s first virtual and interactive telehealth platform for physical therapy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founders and UCSC Baskin School of Engineering alumni Aviv Elor, Michael Powell, and Ash Robbins sought to blend their expertise in virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics to make a difference in the telehealth and virtual physical therapy space.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The questions we asked when we started developing this platform were: How can we use emerging technologies and virtual reality to help people in physical rehabilitation and how can we make it more accessible, affordable, and accurate?&#8221; said Elor, who received a B.S. degree in robotics engineering and a Ph.D. degree in computational media from Baskin Engineering.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immergo uses artificial intelligence and virtual reality (VR) to incorporate telehealth capabilities and enhance the accessibility, experience, and accuracy of remote physical therapy care. With just a VR headset, the platform connects patients and therapists in the same room, as if they were interacting live in person. Therapists can track visual movements and range of motion and provide real-time feedback on exercises. The platform also provides a technical solution to accurately evaluate and provide guidance to patient recovery by recording key metrics and progress, setting a gold standard for remote physical therapy care.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Bridging academia and industry&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elor, Powell, and Robbins met while working on research projects at Baskin Engineering. Robbins&#8217;s research focus was on artificial intelligence and machine learning, Elor&#8217;s was on virtual reality and user experience, and Powell&#8217;s was on biomechanics. What brought them all together was a research project to aid stroke patients&#8217; rehabilitation with a virtual reality game.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the time they developed the game, Elor suffered a right tricep rupture during a national judo match while competing on the UCSC Judo Team. With the combination of Elor&#8217;s personal physical therapy experience and the knowledge and expertise the three of them gained from developing their virtual reality game, they decided to pursue a novel concept as an effort to reimagine and transform telehealth through virtual reality-based physical therapy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While still working towards completion of their graduate degrees, the team signed up for the National Science Foundation (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program, an immersive, entrepreneurial training program that facilitates the transition from academia research to industry to drive positive social change. Through I-Corps, Elor, Robbins, and Powell gained the knowledge to take their heavily focused academic research concept to the real world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each I-Corps offering requires the cohort of engineers and scientists to speak to their potential customers. The alums spoke with over 130 physical therapists to understand their pain points and gather ideas for an ideal platform. Through the interviews, they quickly grasped that there is a lot of room for telehealth platforms to improve, especially as the pandemic prioritized remote healthcare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were originally thinking of developing an exercise virtual reality game that would allow for better adherence of physical therapy exercises and so on, but we quickly learned from these interviews that physical therapists were looking for help with developing a robust telehealth physical therapy platform,&#8221; said Powell, who graduated from Baskin Engineering with a Ph.D. in computer engineering. &#8220;So we were able to identify where we needed to pivot to make the most impact in this space, and that&#8217;s ultimately when the main mission of Immergo Labs really started to come together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After I-Corps, Elor, Powell, and Robbins took their Immergo idea and started applying to other accelerator programs guided by recommendations from Baskin Engineering faculty and UC Santa Cruz Innovation and Business Engagement Hub staff, and news alerts from Baskin Engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Baskin was our gateway to becoming aware of different opportunities and to move into this entrepreneurial realm,&#8221; Elor explained.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to their UCSC network, the team eventually joined the CITRIS Foundry and Santa Cruz Works accelerator programs, building a foundation of local community support and positioning them to seek out additional opportunities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Immergo platform was further inspired by the team&#8217;s combined 15+ peer-reviewed scientific publications completed during their graduate studies, which utilizes a provisional patent with UCSC. The patent estimates range of motion through VR devices and was co-invented with Baskin Engineering faculty and Immergo technical advisors Sri Kurniawan and Mircea Teodorescu.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Where they are now and where they are headed&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the team showcased their prototype at the American Physical Therapy Association Combined Sections Meeting (APTA CSM), the nation&#8217;s largest physical therapy conference. Showcasing their prototype at an event with thousands of therapists was an exciting milestone in their product development cycle.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There was one really impactful interaction that I had at APTA CSM,&#8221; explained Robbins, who graduated from Baskin Engineering with a robotics engineering B.S. degree and is working towards his Ph.D. in computer science and engineering. &#8220;The man I spoke with said, &#8216;Everyone here that does VR is making some specific game that isn&#8217;t accessible or cost-effective, and is usually focused on something specific. What you guys are doing is essentially making a platform that can be the foundation for a whole other wave of how to do physical rehabilitation.&#8217; He became more and more excited as he learned about the platform and got the chance to explore it himself. It was such a great feeling to know that we&#8217;re going in the right direction with our product.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the founding of Immergo in 2020, the team&#8217;s approach has always been human-first and collaborative. Their advisors include a team of physical therapists who often jump into the platform to try out new features and provide feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re really trying to assist therapists. We&#8217;re not trying to automate the physical therapy rehabilitation process or replace therapists,&#8221; Powell said. &#8220;There is a lot of value in telehealth and augmenting remote care. The human element is and will remain very important.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immergo secured several partnerships this year. They teamed up with the University of Montana Biomechanics Lab for help in developing an innovative balance assessment testing technology that allows therapists to evaluate patients&#8217; balance while decreasing risk of falling when interacting inside the platform. They also collaborated with the metaverse online 3D avatar creator company Ready Player Me so users can have a variety of avatar options to choose from. Additionally, Immergo received letter of intents from Houston Veterans Affairs and the Stanford Health Care Outpatient Physical Therapy Department to help with user testing, and added two local student interns to their team this summer to help with product development and user experience research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team recently received an NSF Phase 1 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant. The $256,000 in funding will allow Immergo Labs to further develop and test their prototype. Next, the team will be applying to the Phase 2 NSF SBIR grant to polish the product, validate the research, and then deploy. The Phase 2 grant provides up to $1 million in funding, intended to supplement venture investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immergo Labs will launch their beta platform in January 2023 to the 70 users currently on their waitlist. They hope to officially launch their product publicly by the end of 2023. And, as of September 22, 2022, the team officially began a startengine fundraising campaign towards their mission in providing accessible and accurate telehealth through the metaverse.

The project will be led by UC Santa Cruz, in partnership with UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and UC Agriculture and Natural Resources (UC ANR).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grant award demonstrates the educational leadership of this group of UC campuses, which are among the most well-established and widely respected university-based organic agriculture programs in the country. Each partner campus and UC ANR will bring unique academic strengths and distinct regional knowledge and networks to the collaboration, in an effort to broaden the student educational experience beyond what any one campus could offer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next three years, the project will establish new options for courses and advising across the three partner campuses and provide students with more opportunities for experiential learning and research internships with UC ANR. These efforts come at a time when organic production has been growing rapidly, resulting in increased demand for professionals trained in organic-centered research, extension, and grower services. The new programs will prepare students for these roles and will be especially focused on underrepresented students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need more diverse voices in organic agriculture leadership if we ultimately want to improve the agricultural system,&#8221; said UCSC Professor Stacy Philpott, faculty director of the Center for Agroecology and project director on the new grant. &#8220;Diversifying the field and making sure that the experiences and knowledge of many different communities are represented will push us to new places in the future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-leads on the grant include UCSC Center for Agroecology Research and Education Coordinator Damian Parr, Ph.D., UC Berkeley Assistant Professor and Co-Associate Faculty Director of the Berkeley Food Institute</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Timothy Bowles, UC Davis Professor and Faculty Director of the UC Davis Agricultural Sustainability Institute Ryan Galt, and UC ANR Assistant Cooperative Extension Specialist and Presidential Director of the UC Organic Agriculture Institute Houston Wilson.</span></p>
<h2>Expanding course and internship offerings</h2>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To better support students in becoming the next generation of organic agriculture leaders, the grant project will combine the best educational offerings from across the UC system. A new intercampus exchange program will be developed to guide students in the UC Santa Cruz Agroecology B.A., the UC Davis Sustainable Agriculture &amp; Food Systems B.S., and the UC Berkeley Food Systems Minor to take courses at any partner campus and apply the credits toward completion of their organic agriculture-related degree program. This will help students follow their interests across the biophysical science and social science aspects of organic agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz will also lead development of a new seven-week, system-wide field quarter program, with a supercourse in organic agriculture. The supercourse cohort of students will travel together to farm operations, UC campuses, and UC ANR field stations statewide for experiential fieldwork focused on organic agriculture production, research, and policy. The UC Santa Cruz Center for Agroecology will serve as the primary host site for the initial supercourse offering in 2024, and the UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies Department will lead instructional development, with administrative support for the fieldquarter program provided by UC ANR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, UC ANR will launch a new program to connect students from partner UCs with internships, paid student staff fieldwork opportunities, and professional development and mentoring, through participation in UC ANR Cooperative Extension-led organic agriculture research projects. Joji Muramoto, a UC ANR Assistant Cooperative Extension Organic Production Specialist based at UC Santa Cruz, is the system&#8217;s only extension agent focused specifically on organic agriculture, and he will contribute to designing the internship program to meet the needs of both students and the state&#8217;s organic farmers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muramoto says California leads the country in organic production, with one-in-five U.S. organic farmers located in the state. Yet specialized organic extension services have historically been lacking. Training more students in this field could help to fill the need.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Both production-wise and in terms of history, California is one of the states leading the organic movement, and our organic farmers deserve to have more public support,&#8221; Muramoto said. &#8220;We need to respond to their unique needs and provide more extension services. Connecting extension specialists with student interns is a win-win, because the extension gets highly motivated assistants, and students gain experience with different types of agricultural research across the state.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the new internship program, UC ANR researchers will receive specialized training to build their mentoring capabilities for working with underrepresented student populations. And all of the new grant programs will strive to demonstrate how farmers and community stakeholders can have direct influence in setting research agendas, defining problems and solutions in organic agriculture, and shaping policy and extension services.&#160;</span></p>
<h2>Supporting student success<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advising services associated with the new grant programs will be designed with the needs of underrepresented students in mind, and a Student Leadership Development Program will use federal work-study funds to provide mentored fieldwork opportunities in organic production at the UC Santa Cruz and UC Davis campus farms for students with financial need. UC ANR internship opportunities will also connect students with scholarship and fellowship funding. And campuses will host career panels featuring alumni from underrepresented groups to help students build professional networks and explore possibilities for their futures.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damian Parr, a UCSC research and education coordinator with the Center for Agroecology and a lecturer in the Environmental Studies Department, is a co-lead on the new grant and says the project ultimately seeks to not only respond to the needs of students but to also take its lead from the many dedicated underrepresented students who have found creative ways to chart their own educational journeys in organic agriculture over the years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The core inspiration for this work has really come from watching students who are minoritized and underrepresented on campus innovate and take advantage of resources across campuses in ways that they see as being best-suited to their needs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Pretty much everything this proposal is putting forward has been done before by students who took it upon themselves to figure out how to do it, but until now, they haven&#8217;t had the programmatic structure and support to make this as accessible to them as it should be.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parr says there&#8217;s a long history of student passion driving advances in organic agriculture research and education at the University of California. In the 1970s, student-led organic farms at UC Santa Cruz and UC Davis were established to draw attention to the environmental and social costs of conventional agricultural production methods.

Look at the long lines at the de Young Museum in San Francisco, which is now hosting the exhibition &#8220;</span><a href="https://deyoung.famsf.org/exhibitions/ramses-great-and-gold-pharaohs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramses The Great And The Gold Of The Pharaohs,&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on display through February 12.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowds at the de Young are staring at sarcophagi, puzzling over mummified cats and lion cubs, and admiring the colossal stone Ramses the Great head at the beginning of the exhibition.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who are interested in ancient Egypt and the Pharaohs and want to get a vivid cultural, religious, and political context for the ancient artifacts on display at the de Young should </span><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/era-of-gold-era-of-empire-in-the-world-of-ramses-the-great-tickets-415545767577"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reserve a spot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for &#8220;</span><a href="https://calendar.library.ucsc.edu/event/9658284"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Era of Gold, Era Of Empire,&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Egyptologist and UCSC history professor Elaine Sullivan&#8217;s talk on Sunday, October 2, at the Museum of Art and History in downtown Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>The talk is organized by The Humanities Institute of UCSC and co-sponsored by the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History (MAH) and UC Santa Cruz Special Collections &amp; Archives.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the free talk is open to the public, seating is limited, so </span><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/era-of-gold-era-of-empire-in-the-world-of-ramses-the-great-tickets-415545767577"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reservations are strongly encouraged.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan will delve into the lives and legacies of other major historical figures museum visitors will meet at the de Young show &#8211; including the powerful women of his reign such as his &#8216;great royal wife&#8217; Nefertari and the king&#8217;s mother Tuya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who see Sullivan&#8217;s talk will also learn about the master craftsman Sennedjem who decorated the royal tombs of Ramses, and the Pharaoh&#8217;s imposing father Sety, whose stunning painted wooden coffin is in the show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Era Of Gold, Era Of Empire&#8221; is a complement to the de Young show. Sullivan calls the show well worth seeing because of its displays of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">statuary from the New Kingdom and pieces of royal jewelry from other periods of Egyptian history, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">though she wished that the curation had delved more deeply into the historical context of the objects on display.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibit shows relics from Ramses II&#8217;s tomb, as well as an assortment of burial objects from Dashur and Tanis, two incident cities along the Nile.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan calls &#8220;Ramses The Great And The Gold Of The Pharaohs&#8221; a rare opportunity to see the artifacts, which are on loan from the Egyptian government.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#8220;Here on the West Coast we don&#8217;t have many places where we have access to these kinds of masterworks of Egyptian art,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;Usually you have to go to New York, Europe, or Cairo.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Still famous after all these years</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s no surprise the exhibition has been reeling people in. In terms of public interest and name recognition, Ramses the Great continues to stand out over most of the estimated 170 Pharaohs who ruled Egypt during the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharaonic Period, which lasted 2,700 years, about 10 times as long as the history of the United States as a country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to 21st century notoriety, Ramses the Great &#8211; who reigned from 1279 through 1213 BCE &#8211; only has one serious rival, King Tutankhamun, Sullivan said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramses II made his mark with many temples, obelisks, and colossal statues of himself. He also expanded Egypt&#8217;s empire and augmented power with his wars against the Hittites, including the epic battle of Kadesh, said to be the biggest chariot battle of all time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of becoming a household name, King Tut has one serious advantage because his tomb was found intact in 1922, at a time when most other known tombs had been looted and in some cases emptied out completely.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But Ramses the Great had two big things going for him,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;One is his long reign. He ruled for more than 60 years as part of the 19th Dynasty, w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hich physically allowed him so much time to build and stamp his name across the country, and he was an incredibly prolific builder.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second major factor is the Pharaoh&#8217;s astonishing penchant for self-promotion and mythologizing, Sullivan said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ramses not only built monuments; he also had his name inscribed on the monuments of his ancestors,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;And when he did that, it was his way of saying, &#8216;I am the new king, and your rightful successor.&#8217; He&#8217;d sort of insert himself into the narrative in all of these different spaces, even if it was something he didn&#8217;t bother to build himself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Egyptologists started figuring out how to translate hieroglyphs, they started seeing the name Ramses again and again, Sullivan said. Ramses was also a larger-than-life figure because was given a combination of lofty roles that tended to be split up in other societies. He was a political ruler but also the top military general, as well as the high priest of Egypt.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;His artwork is both religious and political; it&#8217;s aimed at the gods, and at the elites of ancient Egyptian society,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;It&#8217;s also aimed at the majority of people in ancient Egypt, who could not read. Those big images on monumental buildings were a form of communication in a non-literate world. There are scenes of him defending Egypt against chaos, against outsiders.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Trying to understand the perspective of the ancients</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Museum-goers will notice the amount of lavish decoration that went into the monuments and temples of the Pharaohs but also their tombs. Sullivan will delve into the reasons for this attention to detail. &#8220;Really, the artwork of ancient Egypt is both outwardly facing &#8211; sending a political message &#8211; but it also has a political and religious message. Ramses the Great was seen as a semi divine king and a son of the gods.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitors may find it somewhat harder to understand why other examples of art that were never meant to be seen by anyone had a similar painstaking amount of detail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Why go through so much trouble when the tombs of the dead were shut and sealed away after each powerful king&#8217;s demise?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One reason has to do with the fact that the objects were thought to have carried a spiritual power that would continue through the ages. &#8220;Those objects in a sense were spells that protected the king, allowing him to regenerate,&#8221; Sullivan said. The tomb inscriptions protected the king&#8217;s eternal spirit or &#8220;ka.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those were spells that protected his body, that allowed him to reach and to become a god in the afterlife, and to be reborn every day along with the sun,&#8221; Sullivan explained.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Gossip and complaint: the &#8220;Post-It notes&#8221; of ancient Egyptian artisans</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One room in the de Young exhibition will give museum-goers a rare look at the lives, perspectives, gossip, and complaints of artisans who decorated the tomb of Ramses the Great. Highly educated and painstakingly trained, but not from the elite classes of politicians or royal administration, these artisans were stonecutters, painters, carpenters, and scribes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan said she wished the show had delved more deeply into the lives of those artisans, who used pieces of limestone flakes to write down informal notes to communicate with others. &#8220;We would think of it as ancient Post-It notes,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;They would just write down &#8216;laundry dropped off with the cleaners, this many items&#8217; or &#8216;this is what I paid you for making me that piece of furniture.&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When artisans were finished with those notes, eventually they were tossed down a dried-up well that was used as a garbage bin &#8211; and there they stayed for millennia.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When archaeologists found those notes, all of a sudden we had all this information about what these people did and who they were,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;Archaeologists have been able to build family trees based on the information.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some notes are hilarious even now.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They complain about everyone who's living in the village, and there's one guy who's sleeping with everyone's wife, and they're all furious at him, and there are notes showing that people are knocking off work and pretending to be sick,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;So we just see all of those kinds of human beings that we want to know about the ancient world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>A three-dimensional look into the ancient world&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her talk,&#160; Sullivan will briefly take MAH patrons into a model of Ramses' Abu Simbel temple. In her own research, Sullivan uses 3D computer imaging to create intricate models of ancient sites, like the temples of Karnak and the cemetery Saqqara, both of which underwent significant construction during Ramses' reign. She uses 3D technologies to visualize archaeological sites across space and time, giving us a new perspective of these ancient places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was awarded the 2020 Roy Rosenzweig Prize for Innovation in Digital History by The American Historical Association</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(AHA) for her project </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/sullivan-digtal-egypt.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constructing the Sacred: Visibility and Ritual Landscape at the Egyptian Necropolis of Saqqara.</span></i></a></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This publication is among the first to push the boundaries to include interactive 3D models that can be navigated both spatially and temporally. It was published earlier this year by Stanford University Press as part of their new series of monographs and scholarly publications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These technologies help us draw inferences about what these places look like, the same way I imagine people making tremendous inferences from looking at a fossil,&#8217;&#8217; Sullivan said. &#8220;I feel like 3D modeling is the closest thing I can imagine to the ability to time travel, because it allows me to reimagine and consider spaces that no longer exist.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>A co-founder of the United Farm Workers union, founder and president of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Huerta has spent more than 60 years as a community organizer, garnering numerous national awards for her lobbying efforts on behalf of farmworkers, immigrants, women, and so many others. In doing so, she has focused a spotlight on issues ranging from labor rights to voter registration to economic inequality.</span></p>
<p><span>The RCA&#8217;s strong focus on issues closely associated with Huerta make this naming an ideal fit. The center&#8217;s work is emblematic of our deep, campuswide commitment to social and environmental justice and our long history of cross-disciplinary research. The center&#8217;s renaming enables us to recognize Huerta&#8217;s incredible legacy and to reaffirm it at a moment in time when the political tides seek to diminish leaders like Huerta. Many UC Santa Cruz students &#8212; the next generation of change makers &#8212; will be inspired by Huerta for years to come. The naming will also bring wider recognition to the center itself, something richly deserved.</span></p>
<p><span>Established at Merrill College in 1992 as the Chicano Latino Research Center, the center broke ground by putting in conversation the historically disconnected fields of Chicanx/Latinx and Latin American studies. The RCA, now housed in the Division of Social Sciences, is the first research center in the University of California system to advance a broad program of multidisciplinary research and community initiatives in these areas. Over the past three decades, the center has sponsored trailblazing research on issues ranging from migration to environmental degradation.</span></p>
<p><span>The center has also built a vibrant community around this work, mainly by giving students, many of whom are from underrepresented groups or are the first in their families to attend college, the opportunity to engage in hands-on research. Allowing students to tap their own cultural insights and strengths, and to make an impact on issues that matter to their communities and families, has proven to be deeply empowering.</span></p>
<p><span>We are humbled by this naming and excited for the next steps in this journey. The Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas will expand its programs in ways that align with Huerta&#8217;s values and launch a fundraising campaign to support these efforts. UCSC is also working closely with Dolores Huerta and the Dolores Huerta Foundation to build a lasting partnership that ensures Huerta&#8217;s legacy continues.</span></p>
<p><span>My thanks to RCA Director Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell, the RCA Steering Committee, and the center&#8217;s affiliated staff, faculty, and graduate and undergraduate students, who have continuously advanced the center&#8217;s impact over the years &#160;and led the effort to name the center in honor of Dolores Huerta. Our campus community is excited to celebrate this day with all of you, and honored that we have the opportunity to recognize the incredible legacy of Dolores Huerta.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cindy Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7f78583d807270465a2acc6a96b2b5bd"><name>downtown-day</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Downtown Day to welcome UCSC students back to downtown</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz, the Downtown Association, the City of Santa Cruz, and the Museum of Arts &amp; History (MAH) are partnering to bring students to see the vibrant downtown area Friday, October 7th from 4-7pm.</summary><start-date>1664262000000</start-date><path>/2022/09/downtown-day</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/09/downtown-day</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1664290936870</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1664290936870</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>UC Santa Cruz, the Downtown Association, the City of Santa Cruz, and the Museum of Arts &amp; History (MAH) are partnering to bring students to see the vibrant downtown area Friday, October 7th from 4-7pm.

<p><span><strong>More housing for students</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We are seizing every opportunity to increase the amount of campus housing for students. We provide housing for about half of our undergraduates, yet we must do more. We are moving forward on near-term projects to build more housing and developing long-term plans that will enable us to continue to increase the availability of campus housing for students and employees.</span></p>
<p><span>California leaders are recognizing this urgent need and earmarked $89 million in this year&#8217;s state budget for our campus to expand the student housing component of our </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://connect.ucsc.edu/redirect.aspx?linkID%3D12245577%26sendId%3D3776723%26eid%3D397724%26gid%3D1001&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664376449455000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Yg5pN9Dmx8kjQbMSxsn-Q" href="https://connect.ucsc.edu/redirect.aspx?linkID=12245577&amp;sendId=3776723&amp;eid=397724&amp;gid=1001" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Kresge College renewal project</span></a></span><span>. Once completed, Kresge will house close to 1,000 students, about 600 more beds than the 50-year-old residential college originally held. This project will allow us to house more students, and the grant funding helps to keep the project affordable, savings that ultimately benefit students. I am grateful for the state support. It is a big win for our campus and our students.</span></p>
<p><span>While we are welcoming approximately 5,100 new Banana Slugs to our campus this fall, a mix of first-year and transfer students, that number is about 800 fewer from fall 2021. We are carefully managing student enrollment as part of our effort to address the statewide housing crisis that is felt so acutely in our community.</span></p>
<p><span>Our effort to create more housing does not stop at Kresge. We remain committed to our already approved </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://connect.ucsc.edu/redirect.aspx?linkID%3D12245576%26sendId%3D3776723%26eid%3D397724%26gid%3D1001&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664376449455000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3pGpGLqW1L_AKG0yKHh2Sh" href="https://connect.ucsc.edu/redirect.aspx?linkID=12245576&amp;sendId=3776723&amp;eid=397724&amp;gid=1001" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Student Housing West project</span></a></span><span>. This development, delayed by lawsuits, will enable us to offer housing &#8212; roughly 3,000 beds &#8212; to graduate students and upper-division undergraduates who would otherwise be living in the greater community. We believe the project is a win for the campus and for the city.</span></p>
<p><span>We are also developing a multi-year housing plan that has projects in the planning, design and/or construction stage at all times. This will allow us to move on to another project if one is delayed, and to regularly deliver beds to meet our housing goals.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Strategic planning on tap</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This is a pivotal year for UC Santa Cruz. In addition to the thinking, teaching, learning, researching, and creating that unfolds on our campus, we are going to have a campus-wide conversation about our strategic direction for the next decade. This process is an opportunity for all of us &#8212; students, faculty and staff &#8212; to work together to develop a shared vision for UCSC&#8217;s future and to align our work with our mission. A steering committee with members from all corners of campus has already been laying the groundwork, establishing central themes ranging from the creation of an unparalleled undergraduate education and student experience to continued distinction in research, scholarship and creative endeavors. The planning process will formally launch in October, and I urge your participation. Strategic planning succeeds when it reflects a wide range of perspectives. Your voice matters and we want to hear from you! I&#8217;ll soon share more details on how to get involved.</span></p>
<p><span>Wishing you all a successful, rewarding and meaningful academic year.

As the first students chosen to participate in The Earth Futures Institute&#8217;s newly launched Frontier Fellows program, Nguyen, Coyle, and Bond have ushered in a new wave of innovative and interdisciplinary research focused on preserving Earth&#8217;s future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For those of us impatient to fix big problems and make a difference in the world, this program gives us the tools to start working, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">right</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">now,&#8221; </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coyle said. &#8220;It has given me confidence in the research process necessary for me to hit the ground running in graduate school and industry, and whatever lies beyond that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piloted in spring 2022 by astrophysics and astronomy professor emerita, Sandra Faber, the Frontier Fellows program funds undergraduate research for a full year, giving students a unique career-building experience. Faber emphasized the importance of funding and supporting undergraduate research opportunities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Research experiences are the most powerful life-changing experiences in education,&#8221; Faber said. &#8220;The Frontier Fellows program offers an incomparable opportunity&#8212;giving undergraduate students an opportunity to spearhead research that inspires them while receiving the funding and mentorship to do so. Students in the Frontier Fellows program are set up for success in their respective interests well after college.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Frontier Fellows program would not have been possible without the generosity of UCSC supporter Catherine Hudson-Webb. Hudson-Webb said she was inspired by Faber&#8217;s commitment to combating climate change and supporting all biological systems on the planet. After hearing Faber speak about the Frontier Fellows program at a local learning group, Hudson-Webb knew she had to support the program in any way she could.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am in despair about the future of our world, though I do what I can to reduce or reverse damage done in my own sphere&#8212;but I am just one person,&#8221; Hudson-Webb said. &#8220;I gather hope in knowing that young people can build upon the ever-evolving world of knowledge and that they may learn as well from our often colossal mistakes as we approach an uncertain future. I am inspired and grateful for the work being done by UCSC&#8217;s Frontier Fellows.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Peter Nguyen, Hayley Coyle, and Aja Bond</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen (Rachel Carson &#8217;22, ecology and evolutionary biology) is studying the effects of climate change on the growth and reproduction of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lupinus nipomensis, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a federally listed endangered flowering plant</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and funding from UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earth Futures Institute Frontier Fellows program, Nguyen is on the front lines of groundbreaking exploratory research in ecology at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Frontiers Fellow Program is important to me because it allowed me to explore the world of biology by pursuing a research project that would have been unfeasible if not for the support of the program,&#8221; Nguyen said. &#8220;This research is important to me on a personal level because I am very passionate about biodiversity conservation. Earth is experiencing a mass extinction of biodiversity, and this research project showed me there is a lot of work for us to do if we want to save our planet.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen uses eDNA techniques to identify potential microbial communities that may be supporting the species' success during intensified climate scenarios and reintroduction efforts. He&#8217;s hopeful that this conservation model can be used for other species as well, to protect the biodiversity of the planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen isn&#8217;t alone in the pursuit of undergraduate research. Fourth year Frontier Fellows Bond (Cowell &#8217;23, art and history of art and visual culture) and Coyle (Crown &#8217;23, applied mathematics) are also pursuing their own undergraduate research using funding from the Earth Futures Institute.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coyle is a fourth year in the Applied Mathematics B.S. program in the Baskin School of Engineering. She is a returning student to UCSC after having spent the last nine years working at two separate VC-funded technology startups in the Bay Area and the Midwest. She hopes to pursue a graduate degree in statistics immediately following graduation and then apply her education in data science, machine learning, and statistics to build</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a medical science startup focused on bioinformatics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I first heard about the FF program, I jumped at the opportunity to apply as soon as possible,&#8221; Coyle said. &#8220;I really felt like this program was going to allow me to obtain the mentorship, publications, and research experiences necessary to move on to graduate school, and then eventually, excel in industry with the eventual goal being to bring urgently called-for solutions to this increasingly complex and troubling world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coyle&#8217;s research assesses plant disease in California shrublands using machine learning and high-resolution drone imagery for climate-ready conservation planning. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her co-author, environmental studies P.h.D candidate Jon Detka, Coyle&#8217;s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">primary goal is to publish a manuscript on the application of drones and machine learning to assess plant disease impacts in drought-stressed California maritime chaparral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What sets the FF program apart is that it really allows students like me to step into the driver's seat and take control of their own research goals and academic future in a way that simply interning on an existing project does not,&#8221; Coyle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Double majoring in studio art and the history of art and visual culture, Aja Bond is working across these two disciplines to explore the intersections of soil and compost and of death and grief. With advisors Jorgge Menna-Baretto and Kyle Parry and collaborators Annette Marines, Judit Camacho, and Ed Shanken, Bond asks what we can learn, see, or make visible by counter-mapping the campus as if it were an ecosystem by focusing on food production, consumption, and waste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her research uses a variety of approaches including walking, photography, and interviews to see what &#8220;loops&#8221; of production, consumption, waste, and decomposition emerge and how they can be made more legible through artistic and visual culture practices.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bond hopes to continue on at UCSC in the new Social Practice and Environmental Art MFA and afterwards get her masters in library and information science to work in libraries, collections, archives, curation, and programming related to art.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The focus of the Earth futures fellowship could not be more important&#8212;empowering and challenging undergrad students to work through long-term research problems with faculty and staff from a variety of disciplines that address the future of the planet in the midst of so many crises&#8212;climate being perhaps the largest ever faced,&#8221; Bond said. &#8220;I feel that this fellowship is perfectly suited to me and my concerns, and is allowing me to build very meaningful professional relationships with my collaborators.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bond said she was grateful for the opportunity to spearhead her own interdisciplinary research at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC is a place where this kind of scholarship thrives, and I was drawn to the school for this very reason.&#8221;</span></p>

As a POC first generation college student, he said he felt pressured to pursue a career in medicine, but in his third year at UC Santa Cruz, Nguyen found his passion in ecology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen is one of three undergraduate UCSC students funded through Frontier Fellows&#8212;a pilot undergraduate research funding program under the Earth Fellow&#8217;s Institute (EFI). Piloted in spring 2022 by astrophysics and astronomy professor emerita, Sandra Faber, the Frontier Fellows program funds undergraduate research for a full year, giving students a unique career-building experience. Frontier Fellows funds interdisciplinary research focused on preserving Earth&#8217;s future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being able to interact with so many professors in my field and getting to work with them on my project has inspired me to become a professor one day and start my own research program; which would not have been possible without the EFI&#8217;s program,&#8221; Nguyen said. &#8220;Because of this, I will be applying to Ph.D. programs this fall.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen is studying the effects of climate change on the growth and reproduction of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lupinus nipomensis, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a federally listed endangered flowering plant</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and funding from UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Earth Futures Institute Frontier Fellows program, Nguyen is on the front lines of groundbreaking exploratory research in ecology at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming months, Nguyen and his team will present their work at the annual BOTANY Conferences, CNPS Conferences, the annual California Botanical Society student research symposium, and to the USFWS </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lupinus nipomensis </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">endangered species recovery team. In addition, Nguyen aim&#8217;s to publish their work in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madrono</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and provide summaries of the research to share directly with land managers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The EFI Frontiers Fellow Program is important to me because it allowed me to explore the world of biology by pursuing a research project that would have been unfeasible if not for the support of the program,&#8221; Nguyen said.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022-2023 academic year is officially underway and campus is teeming with life once more.&#160;</span></p>
<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After more than two years of virtual and hybrid learning, the beginning of the fall quarter last Thursday marked the welcome return to in-person instruction at UC Santa Cruz. The energy and enthusiasm for the year ahead are evident in the many happenings already occurring across campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the delight of students and staff, </span><a href="https://recreation.ucsc.edu/cornucopia/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cornucopia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made a triumphant return to campus this year. For the first time since 2019, East Upper Field was again full of students, their organizations, and boundless opportunities for all to connect with one another and the campus community. The event&#8211;which is often one of the most anticipated and celebrated&#8211;did not disappoint. It featured 257 university departments, offices, and registered student organizations spanning various topical interests.</span>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsored by the Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor&#8217;s office, The Division of Student Affairs and Success, and the Athletics and Recreation Department, Cornucopia also included dinner provided by </span><a href="https://dining.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dining Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://recreation.ucsc.edu/cornucopia/schedule.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">live performances by nine student groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and multiple DJ sets from UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s student-run radio station, </span><a href="https://kzsc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KZSC 88.1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after Cornucopia ended, students filled the Quarry Amphitheater for </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/movie_night_at_the_quarry#.YzMsMuzML0o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Movie Night at the Quarry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The free event was the first ever signature Welcome Week event to be hosted by the <a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/">Division of Student Affairs and Success</a>. In addition to the quintessential UCSC ambience of sitting in the quarry beneath the stars, DSAS staff served movie snacks and popcorn to all in attendance.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated 1,700 students showed up to watch &#8216;Us&#8217;, a movie filmed at Santa Cruz&#8217;s famous beach boardwalk. As the movie started, students&#8217; hushes of one another soon gave way to an excited buzz as they realized they had just been at the movie&#8217;s filming location the evening prior. The day before, nearly 6,500 students purchased tickets and joined in the revelry of the UCSC Boardwalk Frolic! The UCSC Boardwalk Frolic&#8211;a traditional, signature UCSC Welcome Week Event&#8211;also made its return after a two-year, pandemic-induced hiatus. UCSC sophomore, Marissa, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ci_p3stj0aY/?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showcased her time at the event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an instagram video posted to UCSC Admissions Instagram account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, after a successful Welcome Week came to a close, attention turned to the first day of instruction on Thursday, September 22. As students and faculty made their way to classes, the Division of Student Affairs and Success brought a little more fun to kickoff the quarter. Scattered across campus&#8211;from McHenry to Science Hill to Quarry Plaza to the Humanities/Cowell/Stevenson area, DSAS Cabinet members connected with students to share snacks, swag, and s<a href="https://youtu.be/uYnkpgtJTyE">nap &#8220;first day of school&#8221; photos</a>! Students&#8217; smiles said it all: it&#8217;s good to be back on campus, it&#8217;s great to be a Banana Slug, and it&#8217;s exciting to start a new academic year!</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Excited by the possibility of this astrophotonics technology, he reached out to Holger Schmidt, distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering and an expert in the field of photonics, to open a conversation about the potential for collaboration.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, the two researchers have won an NSF grant that will allow them to pursue this emerging technology of making spectrometers on a chip &#8211; tiny devices for separating and measuring light at ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelengths to </span><span class="s2">to study the properties of objects in the sky, including their composition and distance</span><span class="s1">. They believe that this technology can not only enable advances in astronomy when used as part of telescope instrumentation, but can be leveraged for a wide variety of applications across fields such as chemical analysis, environmental monitoring, and biosensing.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;There's a lot of technology now that can be brought to bear in taking these spectrometers &#8211; these color analyzers &#8211; and shrinking them down from about the size of a car to something much more compact, and in some senses more powerful,&#8221; Schmidt said.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spectrometers-on-a-chip have the potential to be very impactful in that sizing down the technology to split and detect wavelengths of light can mean many can be packed on to one single telescope, making it possible to one day collect spectra from tens or even hundreds of thousands of celestial sources simultaneously.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their small size also means they can be produced at a lower cost, transported more easily, and integrated with other components to create a device with a wide range of functionality &#8211; all of the benefits we typically associate with the miniaturization of tech.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The general benefit is just the ability to collect a lot more information from the sky a lot more powerfully and cheaply,&#8221; Bundy said. &#8220;You can imagine putting these devices on a satellite or on a balloon, because they would be so much smaller and lighter.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there are two main challenges the researchers must address before their spectrometers-on-a-chip can be successfully implemented in telescopes and potential other applications.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first is the issue of optimizing the chip itself, which includes making them more efficient, making sure they can record and provide the right information about the light they detect, learning how to integrate them so they can pack multiple chips side-by-side on one device. The researchers need to operationalize the chips so that they can become a robust component of a larger instrument, such as one mounted on a telescope, and not just a device that is studied in the lab.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other main challenge is to couple the light received through the telescope into the miniature spectrometers. Because of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, ground-based telescopes never produce a perfectly stable image of a star, but instead the star is always wobbling slightly in the image. This effect is not conducive to photonic spectrometers, which work best when the light they receive is pure and undisturbed. This requires the scientists to think innovatively about how to best feed light from the telescopes to the spectrometers.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;That challenge is the reason why this is an interesting problem, and it&#8217;s one of the reasons we don't have this technology on existing telescopes,&#8221; Bundy said.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bundy believes there is growing momentum for this area of research, and that it can be of great benefit to ongoing efforts within the astronomy community. For example, a current project at the Rubin Observatory will capture images of and catalog billions of objects in the night sky. Current technology only allows scientists to capture the spectra of 5,000 objects at a time, making a project to follow up on the images captured and measure spectra at this scale nearly impossible. But Bundy hopes that the new devices the UCSC researchers develop will make this affordable and feasible.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;For cosmology and galaxy formation, I don't see another way to continue our forward momentum in terms of better instruments in the 10 to 20 year timescale,&#8221; Bundy said. &#8220;In about ten years, there has to be some technological transformation, or we're kind of stuck. I think there's going to be growing interest in making this work.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Schmidt&#8217;s lab will focus on designing and testing the miniature spectrometers, with fabrication of the devices spearheaded by collaborators at Brigham Young University. Bundy&#8217;s group, led by graduate student Matt DeMartino, will establish the requirements for the device in order to optimize and test its performance.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I think this will be the first step in hopefully a broader set of programs and projects that combine photonics and astronomy,&#8221; Schmidt said.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The researchers will work to integrate their miniaturized spectrometers onto the telescope at <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org/"><span class="s3">Lick Observatory</span></a>, which is managed by UC Observatories and located close to Santa Cruz. In the near future, the team hopes to test their devices on the telescope there, meaning the three-meter, nearly 80-year old device can play an important role for developing cutting-edge astronomical instrumentation.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The grant will also fund several STEM outreach programs taken on by the researchers. The researchers will run experiments related to photonics as part of the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/packard-grant.html"><span class="s3">Seeds Spoon Science</span></a> program, which teaches local school children and their families science through gardening.

But after being awarded a scholarship through </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/funding/transforming-futures-internship/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transforming Futures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;a pilot scholarship program launched by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Social Transformation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Summer 2022&#8212;Cerros spent her summer interning with the Watsonville Law Center (WLC), and is now confident in pursuing her goal to become a first generation attorney.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m very grateful for the Transforming Futures program and the opportunity it gave me,&#8221; Cerros said. &#8220;This program has genuinely impacted my experience at UCSC and given me the experience that I felt I was lacking to continue pursuing my career goals. I enjoy the work I&#8217;ve been doing and I know I&#8217;ll be able to excel in grad school.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transforming Futures&#8217;s mission is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">open up opportunities and remove financial barriers for first-generation, underrepresented, and/or low-income college students at UC Santa Cruz so they can participate in career-advancing summer internships. Seven UCSC students were awarded up to $6,000 in Transforming Futures Scholarships. These students pursued internships at local non-profit organizations, California government, and an Oakland-based non-profit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the WLC, Cerros </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">worked on research assignments, helped create outreach material, completed the entire process of a u-visa application, and more. At the end of her internship, she was offered a part-time legal-assistant position at WLC.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m usually hesitant to apply for scholarships because they tend to reach a more general audience,&#8221; Cerros said. &#8220;But once I saw that this scholarship was intended for people like me, I knew I needed to apply.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Nationally, unpaid internships disproportionately affect first-generation, underrepresented, and low-income college students.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the</span> <a href="https://cdn.fourwaves.com/static/media/filecontent/421fe962-b1c7-492c-ac87-616a8f8d12ff/81343264-b367-419f-acce-fa67da670532.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Association of Colleges and Employers 2021 Student Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 74 percent of white students said they&#8217;d had unpaid internships and 73 percent had paid internships, compared to 8 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively, for Black students and 10.2 percent and 7 percent for Hispanic or Latinx students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among first-generation students, 25.6 percent reported they were unpaid interns, and 20.5 percent were paid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first program of its kind on the UC Santa Cruz campus, and there's clearly a demand for it</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Faculty Director Chris Benner said. &#8220;The ultimate goals of Transforming Futures are to help launch UCSC students from underrepresented backgrounds into successful careers. And so, giving them that work experience and social connections that they wouldn't have access to otherwise hopefully will help launch them.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benner and Institute Transformation Director Evin Knight spearheaded the debut of Transforming Futures, with the invaluable support of the Experiential Learning Team of campus&#8217;s </span><a href="https://careers.ucsc.edu/about/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Career Success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> department, who helped in designing the program and preparing the students to benefit the most from their internship experience. Dean of Social Sciences Katharyne Mitchell emphasized the importance of offering a program like&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transforming Futures at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I'm truly thrilled that we can provide this type of experience for our students,&#8221; Dean Mitchell said. &#8220;Transforming Futures does just that: it is one of those rare programs that can change student lives in constructive and meaningful ways for the long term. I'm so grateful to our donors for their support and imagination, and to Chris Benner, Evin Knight, and all of the other staff at the Institute for Social Transformation for making this initiative possible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All funds for the Transforming Future Program were made available to students through the generosity and invaluable support of MR Macgill and Ho Nam, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who were attracted to the campus because of its reputation for supporting first generation college students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is clear that internships provide an important experiential learning opportunity for students to gain professional experience, build professional networks, create future career pathways, and are an important component of student success,&#8221; MR said. &#8220;But unfortunately, a number of meaningful internships are unpaid, particularly at non-profit or government organizations, and therefore are not an option for many students with limited financial resources.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking for an institution where they could give back to the community, MR and Ho interviewed high school principals of schools throughout the Bay Area and asked them where their first-generation students were attending college. The top recommendation amongst those interviewed was UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So much usually gets overlooked, but Transforming Futures addresses a number of critical issues,&#8221; MR said. &#8220;The program will teach these students skills that universities don&#8217;t always address.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-year politics student Amanda Safi (John R. Lewis &#8217;24, politics) spent her summer interning </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the House of Representatives at the Office of Congressman Jimmy Panetta. An experience she says enhanced her educational experience at UCSC, and allowed her to explore a career path she hadn&#8217;t been able to before. Without a scholarship from Transforming Futures, Safi wouldn&#8217;t have been able to pursue the unpaid internship and stay in Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Receiving this scholarship helped in relieving the extra stress and pressure from needing to juggle multiple responsibilities at once,&#8221; Safi said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard a lot of people say that the heart of what you learn about in your career is done through outside experience and interactions in the real world, rather than solely in the classroom. I think that that was definitely the case for me in this internship which has elevated my understanding of what I&#8217;ve already learned in class.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Program director Chris Benner said that he is hopeful Transforming Futures will continue to offer life-changing experiences to UC Santa Cruz students in the coming years.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rollout of the program would not have been possible without the support of MR Macgill and Ho Nam. Their generosity created career-changing opportunities for seven UCSC students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Managing Director of Development for the Library and Social Sciences Joop Rubens sat down with donor MR Macgill for a conversation on why she and her husband chose to support UCSC.&#160; &#160;&#160;</span></p>
<h4><strong>How did you find out originally about UC Santa Cruz and our Everett program in particular?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>MR:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our focus in our philanthropy is on breaking the cycle of poverty. And the way we feel best positioned to do this is by getting more first-generation students into, and through, four-year colleges. We particularly want to support students that have financial needs and give these students a genuine chance of getting into solid family-sustaining jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started by researching what the key barriers are for first generation students in both the Bay Area and Baltimore, Maryland, which are our two geographic areas we work in. I wanted to understand what kind of work had been successful so far in addressing the issues faced by first generation students and how we contribute effectively. What are the nuances that previous programs missed? What is the best practice and how do you further improve upon what is currently in place? It remains important to us to truly understand the key barriers to completion of a degree for first generation students. And in addition, we want to understand what prevents these students from getting that first job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In trying to figure this out, we have been taking what I would call a &#8220;funnel approach.&#8221; I first interviewed high school principals of schools with a good number of first-generation students and asked them where their students were attending college, what universities their students selected and where they saw success happening. And the top recommended school was UC Santa Cruz. So I was happy to be introduced to the Dean of Social Sciences, Katharyne Mitchell. When I met Katharyne I was immediately impressed. She was well prepared for my questions, and it was obvious to me that she deeply cares about the success of first-generation students as well. She was extremely clear about what she needed. I explained to her what we were trying to do and where we saw our added value. Her response was positive and she listed a few professors who are really interested in strengthening the sense of belonging for students and in doing the type of programming we thought might work. It was a massive fit. And we actually talked about the plans for an internship program before we even talked about the Everett Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in the process, we were introduced to the Everett Program. I will admit, it took me a while to understand the program exactly. And so, I asked for more exposure to it. The program has a lot of facets to it. It is not easy to explain in simple terms. But we were invited to attend one of the student-centered Everett events where students talked about their work and about how the program benefits them. We were so impressed. Here you have university students who have an authentic chance to work on projects in collaboration with existing community organizations. They explained how they helped to analyze and solve information and communication challenges around issues of social justice and environmental sustainability. These students impressed us a lot. The mentorship that is built into the model, the sense of belonging it brings to these students, etc. The experiences they were gaining will undoubtedly help them in the future when they enter the labor market.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Not everyone is passionate about the success of first-generation students. Why is this area so important to you and Ho?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>MR:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I would like to see things change because I consider myself an empathetic person and I don&#8217;t think the lines are drawn equally. Let&#8217;s put ourselves into the shoes of a student who is the first in her family to go to college. Imagine the difficulties she faces without mentorship. The experiences are not equal. Imagine being a person of color. You are dealing with institutional challenges that others never have to deal with. Challenges I did not have. I know that I was fortunate for being raised in a family that had gone to college. A family that was, in many ways, privileged. My parents and my family had built a social network that I benefited from. Ultimately, I had to work hard to get where I am today, but there were so many subtle and nuanced situations that I encountered that would have been much more challenging had I been the first in my family to go to college. We all know this. But if we do not graduate a more diverse population from our colleges first, how can we expect things to change?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to diversify who gets into university. But we then also need to complement the college experience before graduation. Good mentorship, practical work experience, strong faculty relationships are all a huge help to prepare a college student for the business world. It is one thing to earn your degree. But there are plenty of nuances that are not to be found in textbooks. Not showing up in shorts to a business suit environment, communicating in a professional manner, writing a good resume, listening skills, etc.</span></p>
<h4><strong>How do you stay focused on your vision?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>MR:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Of course, what started happening for us is that we received a lot of requests for donations. And originally, I said to my husband, we are not going to give to the obvious schools in the area. The schools that already raise a lot of funds. No. We are going to think about what's most important to us and be very strategic about where to give. We both joined the boards of programs that seemed to fit our specific interests. I joined the board of the Spark program, which helps underserved middle school students understand the value of an education. Ho joined the board of You Aspire, which helps students get into college through financial counseling - An important cause because there are too many students that get in and get locked into bad loans. Many even drop out with these loans burdening them after the first year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we started quite early with this work. But then, Silicon Valley was really good to us and we suddenly had more resources at our disposal. And frankly, I was somewhat uncomfortable with that. You can&#8217;t help but wonder why you are in that situation. And after a lot of reflection, one day, Ho said: &#8220;What if we give most of what we have away?&#8221; And that felt really good. It immediately felt like the right thing to do. And I feel good about our situation today, realizing that we are able to be generous and that we can work towards creating opportunities for many others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ho was an immigrant to the United States. When he came here, he benefited from a scholarship to attend Phillips Andover High School, which is one of the best schools in the country. His parents came over in part to pursue a better education for all of their children. Both of his parents were highly educated but once here, they had to start from nothing. And so I think he relates more to first-generation challenges. I would also add that Ho&#8217;s business is built less around making money per se, but more around creating solid job opportunities. As a VC he seeks out sustainable companies. Companies that create good jobs for people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we met Katharyne Mitchell and Chris Benner at UC Santa Cruz I felt we found programs that were insightful in addressing the underlying challenges to completing college. Some challenges are obvious. Financial struggles for instance. But the less obvious ones are also being recognized and being addressed by the programs we support at UC Santa Cruz. The sense of belonging, the practical mentorship, etc. I actually learned a lot from the thoughtfulness of your work and we are trying to emulate some of this to a certain extent in Maryland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies show that there are roughly six to eight components that lend itself to success in working towards first generation college completion. It is things like giving students a sense of belonging, addressing imposter syndrome, offering a chance for students to work with near-peer advisors, and strong faculty engagement. Some of these components are subtle, and not easy to implement. You really need wraparound services. But when I talked to Katharyne, I immediately felt we were on the same page. She understands the key barriers and wants to address them. She introduced me to the Everett program, which was then further reinforced with how her and Chris developed the internship program that we're also supporting now&#8212;Transforming Futures.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That program opens up opportunities and removes financial barriers for first-generation, underrepresented, and low-income college students at UC Santa Cruz so they can participate in career-advancing summer internships. It is clear that internships provide an important experiential learning opportunity for students to gain professional experience, build professional networks, create future career pathways, and are an important component of student success. But unfortunately, a number of meaningful internships are unpaid, particularly at nonprofit or government organizations, and therefore are not an option for many students with limited financial resources. In order to expand opportunities for these students, the program provides paid summer internship scholarships. But these students will be guided throughout the process and will receive training, mentorship, and peer support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, small obstacles are often overlooked by any kind of support program. A simple thing like meeting with your faculty and going to faculty office hours is important. But in the case of the Everett program for instance, we listened to the students as some explained how as a first-generation student, early on, they experienced imposter syndrome and so did not advocate for themselves. The group experience and the peer support of that program helped them along slowly. You're sending them in with people who have had the same experiences and so they can help guide them. The new students are guided by fellows and the fellows are guided by full-time staff and faculty. So as an Everett student you're never left hanging without any support. When Ho and I listened to these students we agreed: Anyone would be perfectly happy hiring these students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to the pilot internship program we are helping you launch this year, Transforming Futures. When I read that original proposal to us, I said, once again: You show me why I love working with UC Santa Cruz. So much usually gets overlooked. But Transforming Futures addresses a number of critical issues. The program will teach these students skills that universities don&#8217;t always address. Understanding how to interview, understanding how to write a resume, those are all critical skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately my passion lies in two areas. My primary interest is to address college completion. It would be amazing if I could ensure that in both Baltimore and the Bay Area, every city school student who wants it, has access to wraparound college completion services. And second to that would be to have all those people feel well-prepared for good and meaningful careers. And when I say college completion services, it's everything we talked about. It's peer advising, internships, belonging programs, emergency gap funding, tutoring, emotional support, social networks.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8ee5c8d4807270465a2acc6a65b1ec2e"><name>seal-of-excelencia</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz earns prestigious Seal of Excelencia certification for work as a Hispanic-Serving Institution</title><summary>In recognition of intentional campuswide efforts to serve Latinx students, UC Santa Cruz has earned the Seal of Excelencia, following a thorough data-driven review by Excelencia in Education. </summary><start-date>1664521200000</start-date><display-name>Prestigious Seal of Excelencia certification</display-name><path>/2022/09/seal-of-excelencia</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/09/seal-of-excelencia</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1664549767343</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1665095931875</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Abby Butler</name><title></title><phone/><email>ajbutler@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/seal-of-excelencia-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/seal-of-excelencia-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>seal-of-excelencia-500px.jpg</name><display-name>seal-of-excelencia-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>84395</file-size><width>500</width><height>375</height></image><image-alt>Student in a lab</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/09/images/seal-of-excelencia-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/09/images/seal-of-excelencia-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>seal-of-excelencia-80px.jpg</name><display-name>seal-of-excelencia-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>18862</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Student in a lab</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The 30 seal-certified institutions enrolled 13 percent and graduated 14 percent of all Latinx students in the U.S. for the most recent year.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recognition of intentional campuswide efforts to serve Latinx students, UC Santa Cruz has earned the Seal of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excelencia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, following a thorough data-driven review by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excelencia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Receiving the seal is a great honor and validation of the focused work we began in 2015, when we launched our first HSI initiatives,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;Our HSI leadership team, our Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning and so many faculty and staff across our campus have led us to this moment. I am thrilled for them and also for our students. The work we do in this arena helps us to fulfill our mission as an HSI, but it also helps us better serve all of our students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An institution earns the Seal of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excelencia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by demonstrating alignment across the three core areas of data, practice, and leadership, which show:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidence of effectiveness and intentionality in institutional practices serving Latinx students;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive momentum for Latinx student progress in their data;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dedication to transforming the institution into an environment where Latinx students thrive; and</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategies in leadership that clearly articulate institutional focus on advancing Latinx student success.&#160;</span></li>

<h3>Campus HSI reception</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz will host a reception from 1-2 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 13, on the main floor of the McHenry Library to celebrate everyone who has contributed to the campus's work as a Hispanic-Serving Institution. The event is free and open to the campus community.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz was one of six institutions that earned the Seal of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excelencia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the first time this year. The only other University of California campuses that have earned the seal are UC Riverside and UC Merced.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 30 seal-certified institutions enrolled 13 percent and graduated 14 percent of all Latinx students in the U.S. for the most recent year. The institutions are projecting to continue increasing their efforts to lead the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Seal of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excelencia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> certification is an opportunity at a campuswide level to be self-reflective on our servingness for our Latinx students,&#8221; said Charis Herzon, director of HSI Initiatives. &#8220;The application is an opportunity to analyze disaggregated institutional trend data and individual program effectiveness. The framework highlights our greater impact when efforts are aligned. The certification is given to institutions that also demonstrate their awareness of gaps and places where there is work to be done for Latinx students to thrive. As a UCSC alumna, I am proud of our students, our campus, and our intentionality of the work we have in front of us. Together we will achieve even more.&#8221;<img alt="" height="267" src="images/larive-excelencia-400px.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" width="400"/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HSI teams&#8212;made up of staff, faculty and students&#8212;have partnered in cross-campus collaborations to create systemic change to address barriers that have disproportionately impacted students who have been minoritized in higher education. They seek to create educational justice by empowering students and the campus&#8217;s institutional potential to serve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to its work as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, UC Santa Cruz has a long Latinx-serving history through student organizations, research, and academics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grupo Folkl&#243;rico Los Mejicas, a student-organized folkl&#243;rico dance group at UC Santa Cruz, </span><a href="https://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/grupo-folkorico-los-mejicas-50th-anniversary-spring-show"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrated its 50th anniversary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year. The group has served as a retention and support group for Chicanx/Latinx students throughout UCSC and the Santa Cruz area.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Research Center for the Americas, established in 1992 and set to be </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/rca-naming-dolores-huerta.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renamed in honor of Dolores Huerta next month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is the first research center in the UC system to combine perspectives from the traditionally disconnected fields of Latinx ethnic studies and Latin American area studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://elcentro.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicanx Latinx Resource Center, better known as El Centro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has served since 1995 as a hub of organized activity and resources that support student transition, retention, graduation and academic advancement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, UC Santa Cruz faculty </span><a href="https://lals.ucsc.edu/graduate/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched the nation&#8217;s first Latin American and Latino Studies Ph.D. program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which offers an innovative transnational and interdisciplinary approach to the study of the peoples, cultures, societies and institutions of the Am&#233;ricas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same year, Latinx students made up more than 25 percent of UCSC&#8217;s undergraduate enrollment, making it the third UC to become a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) according to the U.S. Department of Education definition. Three years later, UC Santa Cruz was </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/hsi-award.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">awarded two Department of Education Title V grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help the campus increase achievement for Latinos and all students, as well as partner with San Jose City College to help transfer students earn their bachelor's degrees at a research university. The HSI Team has earned five multimillion dollar grants to </span><a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/hsi-grants/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advance educational equity, cultural inclusivity, and academic achievement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five other newly certified Seal of Excelencia institutions are: Mercy College (New York), San Antonio College (Texas), Texas State University, University of Albany &#8211; State University of New York, and University of Texas at Arlington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.edexcelencia.org/seal-excelencia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seal of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excelencia</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> framework was developed with colleges and universities over many years as a tool for institutional self-assessment. The seal certification is valid for three years and institutions committed to a journey of transformation to intentionally serve their Latinx students may choose to apply for re-certification.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excelencia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> began seal certification as one of the organization&#8217;s transformational strategies to lead colleges and universities to go beyond simply enrolling Latinx students. The seal provides the means to use data and practice to instill intentionality in serving Latinx students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To advance efforts to increase opportunities for those historically underserved by higher education, UC Santa Cruz earlier this year </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/alliance-hispanic-serving-research-universities.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined other leading universities to form the Alliance of Hispanic Serving Research Universities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A coalition of 21 research universities, the alliance is working to double the number of Latinx doctoral students enrolled at member universities and increase by 20% the Latinx professoriate in member universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz holds the distinction of being only one of four institutions in the Association of American Universities that is both an HSI and an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution. The campus is continuing to advance and strengthen its work as a Hispanic-Serving Institution and is working to develop equity-minded partnerships that span across the region, state, and nation and through the academic pipeline.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8ef45946807270465a2acc6a78cdfffa"><name>chancellor-seal-of-excelencia</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Campus earns prestigious seal for commitment to serving Latinx students</title><summary>I am so proud to announce that this morning UC Santa Cruz will be granted the prestigious 2022 Seal of Excelencia for outstanding commitment to serving Latinx students. </summary><start-date>1664521200000</start-date><display-name>Campus earns prestigious seal for commitment to serving Latinx students</display-name><path>/2022/09/chancellor-seal-of-excelencia</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/09/chancellor-seal-of-excelencia</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1664550721812</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1664550721812</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>I am so proud to announce that this morning UC Santa Cruz will be granted the </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/seal-of-excelencia.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664636459719000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Qijfp5-lIb7XGVt6ic1zG" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/seal-of-excelencia.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>prestigious 2022 Seal of Excelencia</span></a>&#160;</span><span>for outstanding commitment to serving Latinx students. We are working tirelessly to provide the environment and support that allows our students to raise the trajectory of their lives, and I am thrilled that our institutional efforts are being recognized. I traveled to Washington, D.C., with Charis Herzon and Juan Poblete, two campus leaders deeply involved with our Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) initiatives, to take part in today&#8217;s formal announcement by the national nonprofit organization </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.edexcelencia.org&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664636459719000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2vS9B1sp7RPwftBv7r6XKu" href="https://www.edexcelencia.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span><em>Excelencia</em> in Education</span></a></span><span>. I hope that you will tune in to a </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Die0XkU0frm0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664636459720000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1uqB9Akp9iYvGnA0IWNYhI" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie0XkU0frm0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>livestream</span></a>&#160;</span><span>of the event that&#8217;s just about to begin.</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving the seal is the end result of a rigorous application process. Institutions must apply for this recognition and document their efforts to serve students. Being a recipient is a great achievement. For our campus, it is validation of the focused work we began in 2015 when we launched our very first </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hsi.ucsc.edu/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664636459720000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3dOJoQfOze8AHY9NpCx2Xf" href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>initiatives</span></a>&#160;</span><span>as an HSI. It speaks to our ongoing commitment to advance student success by improving retention and graduation rates and closing equity gaps. Our HSI leadership team, our Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning, our Student Success and Equity Team, and so many faculty and staff across our campus have led us to this moment, and I am excited for them and for all of our students. This work helps to fulfill our mission as an HSI and allows us to better serve our entire student body.</span></p>
<p><i>Excelencia</i> in Education established the seal four years ago as a way to recognize institutions that strive to go beyond enrollment figures and intentionally focus on what Latinx students need to succeed. There are roughly 560 HSIs in the United States, as well as other colleges and universities that serve Latinx students without the HSI designation, and only 30 total have received the seal. Institutions must demonstrate accountability or positive momentum in a half-dozen areas ranging from student retention to degree completion, while also showing effective institutional practices, a strong culture of servingness for Latinx students, and general leadership in advancing Latinx student success.</p>
<p><span>That our efforts measure up is extremely satisfying. We are one of just 21 Hispanic-Serving Institutions in the United States that is also an R1 university, which designates very high research activity. Of these 21 institutions, only four have both HSI and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution designations and are also members of the prestigious Association of American Universities. That is a great responsibility, and one that we strive to live up to.</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving the Seal of Excelencia is a collective honor for UC Santa Cruz, and would have been impossible without the hard work of HSI Initiatives Director Charis Herzon and Professor Emerita of Psychology Catherine Cooper who led our Seal of Excelencia application team. I am grateful for their months-long effort, and for the work of our entire </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hsi.ucsc.edu/about/hsi-team.html%23hsi-staff&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664636459720000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Ytz4QiQtaggZbXRbi-8Zu" href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/about/hsi-team.html#hsi-staff" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>HSI team and Leadership Committee</span></a></span><span>, as well as faculty and staff campuswide.</span></p>
<p><span>In closing, thank you to all in our campus community &#8212; &#160;students and staff, faculty and friends, alumni and community partners &#8212; who work tirelessly toward educational equity and justice. Together we are making a difference. Our work, though, is not finished. We continue to look for ways to serve our students and their communities, ensuring positive change as well as personal and professional success long after students have left our campus.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cindy
