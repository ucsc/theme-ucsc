<h2>Jan. 3-14: Remote and Alternative Instruction</h2>
<p>As communicated in this <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/12/winter-quarter-update.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1641322551793000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2M6ahA1YyBwWJ_KDiglbHw" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/12/winter-quarter-update.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message</a> from Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer, UC Santa Cruz is beginning the first two weeks of winter quarter (Jan. 3-14) with alternative and remote modes of instruction. Faculty and staff are recommended to hold meetings and events remotely for these first two weeks as well.</p>
<p><strong>Employees with questions about their work modality during these first two weeks of the quarter should consult their managers and supervisors if they have not done so already.</strong></p>
<h2>Jan. 31: Booster Deadline</h2>
<p>The <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus%23dec-21&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1641322551793000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1XDo4h3mTYfG-Fo0BJ1xF4" href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus#dec-21" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UC system COVID-19 vaccination policy</a> requires faculty, staff, and students to obtain a booster shot as soon as they are eligible. You are eligible for a booster if it has been at least 2 months since you received the J&amp;J COVID-19 vaccine or 6 months after your second Moderna or Pfizer dose. We ask eligible employees to get their booster before the start of instruction. <strong>UCSC&#8217;s deadline for compliance with the booster requirement is Jan. 31, 2022.</strong> Employees who are not eligible by the Jan. 31 deadline must comply with the booster requirement within two weeks of eligibility. You can find a location providing booster shots in your area on the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1641322551793000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0C_udvjCbCzQjZlQuhMwsv" href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/Vaccine.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Santa Cruz County Health website</a> or California&#8217;s <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://myturn.ca.gov/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1641322551793000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1gEpdQnFKOqvtWZy9Rzh-V" href="https://myturn.ca.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MyTurn website</a>.</p>

<h2>On-Site Work: Testing Requirements</h2>
<h3>48 Hours Before You Arrive</h3>
<p>Once your on-site return date has been scheduled, <em>employees who are not fully vaccinated</em> are required to get tested or take a self-administered COVID-19 test 48 hours prior to returning to on-site work.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that <em>fully vaccinated employees</em> get tested or take a self-administered COVID-19 test at least 48 hours before returning to on-site work.</p>
<p><strong>For <em>all employees,</em> if your test is positive, please postpone your return until your healthcare provider has cleared you. If you have been exposed through close contact, please contact your manager and follow current <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-on-Isolation-and-Quarantine-for-COVID-19-Contact-Tracing.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1641322551793000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1UbUUt2Cqz5xj7jRgyqMv0" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-on-Isolation-and-Quarantine-for-COVID-19-Contact-Tracing.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CDPH Guidelines</a>.</strong></p>
<h3>Returning to On-Site Work</h3>
<p>Employees who are <em>not fully vaccinated</em> are required to test at an on-campus testing site within 48 hours of their return to on-site work. After your initial on-site test, you will need to resume the testing cadence of at least once every 4 days.</p>
<p><em>Please Note:</em> The 4-day testing requirement does not apply to employees who have completed a COVID-19 vaccine series but are not yet eligible for their booster or who will receive their booster by Jan. 31.</p>
<p><em>Fully vaccinated employees</em> are advised to take an on-site Fulgent PCR test when they return to campus, but it is not required. The university also has rapid antigen tests available, if desired. Visit the Merrill Cultural Center or the Bay Tree Bookstore to pick up a rapid antigen test kit.</p>
<p><strong>Regardless of vaccination status, all employees</strong> will also need to complete the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1641322551793000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2oE25WEC_u_kO16KXPe_iN" href="https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">daily symptom checker</a> once they return to on-site work.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, we recommend that all employees</strong> self-monitor for any COVID-like symptoms within 7 days of their return as a best practice. Please notify your medical provider as appropriate.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1641322551793000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3C_KHcY1k6DxqZeHqZIIIW" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Testing Protocols webpage</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>Register for On-Campus Testing Online</h2>
<p>Over Winter Break, you should have received a registration email from Fulgent Genetics for COVID-19 testing. Your registration includes an ID that you may need to enter to schedule an appointment for an on-site test when you return to campus. If you missed your registration deadline, you should have received another email prompting you to register.

<h2>Winter Quarter FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>I won&#8217;t be eligible for a booster shot before the Jan. 31 deadline. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>Once you become eligible, you must comply with the booster requirement within 2 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Will UCSC be providing booster clinics for staff and faculty?</strong></p>
<p>Employees should contact their primary healthcare provider for information about scheduling a booster appointment. At this time, the Student Health Center is not able to offer boosters to employees, though the campus is evaluating how it can expand the clinics to serve employees.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I find support for remote or alternative instruction?</strong></p>
<p>Please visit the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1641322551793000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2oGMbpK2Tumy-O7trI0Me4" href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Keep Teaching website</a> for additional resources.</p>
<p><span><strong>Should I stay home or come back to work on Monday, January 3?</strong></span></p>
<p>If you are unclear, please consult with your supervisor on whether your work should be on-site, remote, or hybrid during the first 2 weeks of winter quarter.</p>
<p><strong>I have an in-person event scheduled in January. Do I need to make it virtual?</strong></p>
<p>We recommend that scheduled events and meetings be remote through Jan. 14. For events on and after Jan. 18, please contact your supervisor (or event coordinator if relevant) to discuss the best approach for your specific event as public health guidelines are rapidly evolving.</p>
<p><strong>Are face coverings required indoors and outdoors on campus?</strong></p>
<p>Face coverings are a requirement indoors on the UC Santa Cruz campus, and the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1641322551793000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ItCOQrRqr7-qq2ErUJG86" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">California Department of Public Health</a> requires them indoors across the state. This order is in effect until at least Jan. 15, 2022.

Nick, as we all called him, first came to UC Santa Cruz on sabbatical in the fall of 1967 from the University of Illinois (his second position after a stint at UC Berkeley) and obviously made a splash since he was soon made an offer to join our faculty the next year as a tenured fellow of Cowell College.</p>
<p>Nick was used to making splashes. When he was only 23, his 1955 McGill University M.A. thesis, <em>Cohomology Theory in Abstract Groups</em>, was published as a book by McGill University Press&#8212;an extraordinary achievement. At the time, he also had an interest in physics, so he decided to spend his next year at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. There, he met the famous Princeton mathematical physicist Arthur Wightman, who was impressed enough to invite Nick back to Princeton as a graduate student.</p>
<p>At Princeton, Nick was made aware of the fact that, to the discomfort of many leading physicists, a fundamental theorem central to physics, the spin-statistics theorem, had not yet been rigorously established by a mathematical proof. The spin-statistics theorem implies that half-integer spin particles are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle while integer spin particles are not.</p>
<p>The basic building blocks of matter such as protons, neutrons, and electrons are fermions (particles with half-integer spin). Particles such as the photon are bosons (with integer spin). The Pauli exclusion principle states that two or more identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.</p>
<p>As a beginning Princeton graduate student, and essentially having mainly a background in group theory, Nick applied Hilbert space methods and a new theorem in quantum field theory to completely solve the problem.</p>
<p>At Santa Cruz, Nick returned to his first love, group theory, and the big 20th century problem of the classification of finite simple groups.</p>
<p>In the mid 1970s, the famous group theorist John Thompson made a conjecture called the U-Conjecture involving four properties of centralizers of involutions in finite simple groups. Nick verified these properties completely, proving Thompson&#8217;s conjecture in the most important cases.</p>
<p>In other work, with his student Carolyn Williamson, Nick classified all involutions and their centralizers in groups of Lie type of odd characteristic.</p>
<p>One can say that Nick's work as an active faculty member was primarily about studying properties of known simple groups, which of course played a vital role in the inductive proof of the historic classification of finite simple groups. Nick was also known to be extraordinarily generous with his ideas, and his mathematical work was both lucid and compelling.</p>
<p>In the Mathematics Department he was, for many years, the person in charge of the curriculum&#8212;both the development of new courses and the faculty teaching assignments, which he always did in a fair and judicious manner.</p>
<p>He was an opponent of what he saw as the extremes that some of the colleges went to in those early years, and we all knew that Nick Burgoyne was straightforward, direct, and never minced his words.</p>
<p>In retirement Nick remained mathematically very active, working especially with UCSC Professor Emeritus Al Kelley.</p>

<p>&#8220;We finally detected the death throes of this relatively common type of stellar explosion,&#8221; said Ryan Foley, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Foley&#8217;s team leads the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE) transient survey, which observed the red supergiant during the last 130 days leading up to its deadly detonation. &#8220;This was only possible because of the Young Supernova Experiment, which is able to detect subtle changes of very faint and distant stars,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The research team reported their findings in a paper <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac3f3a">published January 6 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a breakthrough in our understanding of what massive stars do moments before they die,&#8221; said lead author Wynn Jacobson-Gal&#225;n, a UCSC alumnus and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at UC Berkeley. &#8220;Direct detection of pre-supernova activity in a red supergiant star has never been observed before in an ordinary Type II supernova. For the first time, we watched a red supergiant star explode!&#8221;</p>
<p>Using the Pan-STARRS telescope at the Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii, the YSE team first detected the doomed massive star in summer of 2020 via the huge amount of light radiating from the red supergiant. A few months later, in fall 2020, a supernova lit the sky.</p>
<p>The team quickly captured the powerful flash and obtained the very first spectrum of the energetic explosion, named supernova 2020tlf, or SN 2020tlf, using the W. M. Keck Observatory&#8217;s Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS). The data showed direct evidence of dense circumstellar material surrounding the star at the time of explosion, likely the same gas that Pan-STARRS had imaged the red supergiant star violently ejecting earlier in the summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the data came off the telescope, I saw the telltale signs of a supernova ramming into some material thrown off the star shortly before explosion,&#8221; Foley said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keck was instrumental in providing direct evidence of a massive star transitioning into a supernova explosion,&#8221; added senior author Raffaella Margutti, associate professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley. &#8220;It&#8217;s like watching a ticking time bomb. We&#8217;ve never confirmed such violent activity in a dying red supergiant star, where we see it produce such a luminous emission, then collapse and combust, until now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team continued to monitor SN 2020tlf after the explosion. Based on data obtained from Keck Observatory&#8217;s DEep Imaging and Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) and Near Infrared Echellette Spectrograph (NIRES), they determined SN 2020tlf&#8217;s progenitor red supergiant star, located in the NGC 5731 galaxy about 120 million light-years away, was 10 times more massive than the sun.</p>
<p>The discovery defies previous ideas of how red supergiant stars evolve right before blowing up. Prior to this, all red supergiants observed before exploding were relatively quiescent&#8212;they showed no evidence of violent eruptions or luminous emission, as was observed prior to SN 2020tlf. However, this novel detection of bright radiation coming from a red supergiant in the final year before exploding suggests that at least some of these stars must undergo significant changes in their internal structure, which then results in the tumultuous ejection of gas moments before they collapse.</p>
<p>Margutti and Jacobson-Gal&#225;n conducted most of the study during their time at Northwestern University, with Margutti serving as an associate professor of physics and astronomy and member of CIERA (Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics), and Jacobson-Gal&#225;n as a graduate student.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s discovery paves a path forward for transient surveys like YSE to hunt for luminous radiation coming from red supergiants and gather more evidence that such behavior could signal the imminent, supernova demise of a massive star.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am most excited by all of the new &#8216;unknowns&#8217; that have been unlocked by this discovery,&#8221; said Jacobson-Gal&#225;n. &#8220;Detecting more events like SN 2020tlf will dramatically impact how we define the final months of stellar evolution, uniting observers and theorists in the quest to solve the mystery on how massive stars spend the final moments of their lives.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="27150405807270462612537c376dfedf"><name>park-mobile-roll-out</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Parking pay station decommissioning, ParkMobile roll out</title><summary>On January 14, 2022, TAPS will take the parking pay stations on the residential campus off line and replace them with the ParkMobile mobile payment system.</summary><start-date>1641283200000</start-date><display-name>Parking Pay Station Decommissioning &amp; ParkMobile Roll Out</display-name><path>/2022/01/park-mobile-roll-out</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/01/park-mobile-roll-out</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1641333195760</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1641342619073</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TAPS is pleased to announce an exciting new change to your on-campus parking options!</span></p>

The meeting—over a cup of coffee—sparked a friendship that would change both of their lives. </article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former NFL player and the homeless man were both lost when they found each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The football player, an ex-linebacker for the Detroit Lions named Zack Follett, had seen himself slipping into a lifestyle he didn&#8217;t like and was on a self-imposed fast and ascetic retreat in an attempt to find a new path. The homeless man, Tommy Alejandrez, was addicted to methamphetamine and full of despair. He had no shelter, no food, and not even a pair of shoes since they&#8217;d been stolen while he slept.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their meeting on a busy street corner in Fresno would change their lives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alejandrez would get sober, go to community college, and win a $20,000 Karl Pister Leadership Opportunity Award at UC Santa Cruz, where he is now majoring in sociology and Latin American and Latino studies. Follett would start a coffee ministry at a homeless encampment and discover he could fight his own depression by service to others. Their story would eventually be told on national TV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Said Follett: &#8220;Tommy blessed me as much as I blessed him.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was just so happy that someone saw me,&#8221; Alejandrez said.</span></p>
<h3>A sign and the spirit</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their story began seven years ago as Follett drove to the coffee shop he owned in Fresno called Kuppa Joy. A devout Christian, he said he&#8217;d found himself living a too-comfortable life and falling into sin. He was sleeping on a bare mattress in an empty house he owned, fasting and reading the Bible and a book that espoused a simple life rather than the material one the American dream promised, he said.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day he passed Alejandrez, the homeless man was holding a cardboard sign. It read: &#8220;Everybody dreams of coming here and becoming a U.S. citizen and having the white picket fence. Even Dr. Martin Luther King had a dream. Please, Lord, wake me up from this homeless nightmare.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sign&#8217;s message struck Follett and that night, as he read in the empty house, he said he felt the spirit of God telling him, &#8220;I want you to go there tomorrow and bring that man coffee and scones and tell him that I love him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next morning, Alejandrez watched as the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Follett approached. Follet held two cups of coffee and a bag of pastries. The two settled on a nearby patch of grass and began to talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alejandrez told Follett he&#8217;d had a good job as a tax preparer, but the recreational use of methamphetamine had turned into an addiction. He&#8217;d lost his apartment and was sleeping behind Dumpsters, eating out of garbage cans, using water fountains to bathe, and shoplifting or panhandling to support his habit. He&#8217;d been beaten, robbed, and jailed for petty theft and for possession of a shopping cart, which was illegal in Fresno.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He&#8217;d contemplated suicide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So had Follett, who&#8217;d been forced out of a career he loved by injury and who said he suffered from depression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We all have stories,&#8221; Alejandrez said, &#8220;and all our stories are important.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follett drove Alejandrez to a Nordstrom Rack store and bought him clothes and shoes. Then, he took him to an organic grocery store and paid for four bags of groceries before driving him back to the corner.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I said, &#8216;All right, man, it was great hanging out with you,' and I said a prayer that God would keep him and help him on his journey,&#8221; Follett said. &#8220;I told him he could find me at Kuppa Joy and I left.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alejandrez couldn&#8217;t forget the respect Follett had shown him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six months later, a desperate Alejandrez was huddled under a pile of blankets across from a McDonald's. He was trying to stay warm against a brutally cold tule fog when he had a chance meeting with his cousin, who alerted Alejandrez&#8217;s father. His dad came to Fresno to retrieve Alejandrez and enrolled him in a three-month rehabilitation program in Watsonville, where Alejandrez also found out he was HIV-positive.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That was a pivotal moment for me. I decided I need to take care of Tommy and love Tommy,&#8221; Alejandrez said.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A new start</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He enrolled at Cabrillo College, emailing Follett to tell him he was sober and pursuing a degree. Follett sent him a laptop to help him with his studies. While at Cabrillo, where he earned a 4.0 GPA, Alejandrez discovered a program called </span><a href="https://undergroundscholars.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underground Scholars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It helps the formerly incarcerated or those affected by the carceral system find success in higher education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program inspired him to apply to several UC campuses, and he was accepted by UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, UC Davis, and UC Santa Cruz. He chose Santa Cruz, which not only offered him the prestigious Pister Scholarship but also housing where he could take care of his father, who was ill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follett, meanwhile, also couldn&#8217;t forget those few hours with Alejandrez. Not only had Alejandrez&#8217;s story touched him, but also he&#8217;d seen how people looked away rather than meet a homeless person&#8217;s eyes, turning Alejandrez invisible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He began taking 10 gallons of coffee and hot chocolate to a homeless encampment in Fresno each Wednesday with the idea that, like Alejandrez, those without houses deserved to be seen and listened to. He also discovered that serving others combatted his depression, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s such an incredible story of God, obedience, and perseverance,&#8221; said Follett, who played football for UC Berkeley before he turned pro.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alejandrez plans to get his degree in 2023 and find a job that &#8220;gives me the ability to make an impact on others as well as myself. A job that has room for me to advance and grow in longevity and stability.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said: &#8220;I&#8217;m so grateful for the opportunities, and I want people to see &#8230; that if you take those opportunities and are willing to do the work, there might be a path to get over the barriers in your life. It&#8217;s up to you to break down the obstacles little by little&#8221; so you can succeed.</span></p>

Walter Branson will serve as interim Senior Associate Vice Chancellor for Administration, effective Jan. 3.</p>
<p>The BAS portfolio is broad and the unit provides services and activities critical to the successful pursuit of our teaching, research and public service mission. As interim Senior Associate Vice Chancellor, Walter will have direct responsibility and oversight for Physical Planning, Development, and Operations, and for Audit &amp; Management Services. With this oversight authority, Walter will partner with Biju Kamaleswaran, interim Vice Chancellor for BAS, in his leadership of the division. Biju has stepped into this leadership role at an important time for BAS and this partnership will lay the foundation for greater success as we prepare to launch a search for a permanent leader.</p>
<p>Walter brings to UCSC a career in finance and administration executive leadership in public universities. Most recently, Walter was Interim Vice President for Administration and Finance at Arkansas Tech University. Prior to this, he was Vice President, Finance and Operations and Chief Business Officer at Wright State University from 2017-2019, Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration at Missouri University of Science and Technology, 2013-17, and Vice Chancellor for Financial Affairs at Indiana University-Purdue University, Fort Wayne, 1993-2013. He has a Masters of Science in Industrial Administration from the Krannert School of Management, Purdue University and a B.S. in Forest Management from Purdue University.</p>
<p>We arranged for Walter to join us in this interim capacity through The Registry, an interim placement firm for U.S. higher education institutions. The Registry is a selective membership-based firm that provides higher education organizations with potential candidates who have had successful careers as vice chancellors, deans, vice presidents, and presidents. Walter&#8217;s engagement with us will continue through August 2022.</p>
<p>The search process for a permanent Vice Chancellor will begin later this quarter. CP/EVC Kletzer will chair the search and we anticipate a fall 2022 start. Details about the search process will be shared as they become available.</p>
<p>Please help us welcome Walter to campus.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Cynthia Larive  Chancellor;  Lori Kletzer  Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="27693841807270462612537c9aa2fe31"><name>graduate-division-staff</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Graduate Division welcomes two new staff members</title><summary>Donald Smith, professor of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology, will serve as associate dean of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs, and Lorato Anderson will serve as the director of diversity, equity and inclusion. </summary><start-date>1641283200000</start-date><display-name>Graduate Division</display-name><path>/2022/01/graduate-division-staff</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/01/graduate-division-staff</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1641338714153</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1641338714153</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Graduate Division is excited to announce two new additions to its leadership team.</p>
<p>Donald Smith, professor of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology, will serve as associate dean of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs, and Lorato Anderson will serve as the director of diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Donald Smith, Ph.D.</strong> <br/><em>Associate Dean of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs</em> <em>Professor, Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology</em></p>
<p>Dr. Smith received his Ph.D. in biology at UC Santa Cruz in 1991 and started as an assistant professor at UCSC in 1996. He is currently a distinguished professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology. He has worked extensively in extramurally funded research programs and has been mentoring and training graduate students and postdoctoral scholars across a wide array of fields and disciplines.<img alt="donald-smith.jpg" height="150" src="images/donald-smith.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 5px;" width="250"/></p>
<p>In administrative leadership roles, he has served as chair of the Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology Department and as chair of the Academic Senate Graduate Council. He has also served on the UC Systemwide Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs and as co-chair of both the Senate-Administration Working Group on Graduate Education and the Master&#8217;s Incentive Program (MIP) Working Group.</p>
<p>Don is a wonderful addition to our team, who brings great personal warmth and a plethora of experience to the role and with the understanding that &#8220;a strong and visible graduate enterprise is fundamental to the success of an R1 AAU research university, in part because of the essential role it plays in training the next generation of scholars, innovators, and leaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a member of the Graduate Division executive team, Don will work on strategic initiatives regarding graduate students and postdocs. He will also co-chair the Task Force for Inclusive Excellence in Graduate Education, which will focus on implementing the recommendations proposed in the Joint Senate-Administration Working Group on Graduate Education (JWG) report from March 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Lorato Anderson</strong> <br/><em>Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</em></p>
<p>Ms. Anderson graduated with a B.A. in Literature/Writing from UC San Diego and received her M.S. in Higher Education Administration and Policy from Northwestern University, where she researched and developed assessment models for English Language Learners and created multiple DEI programs that are still active today. She has extensive experience in grant writing, teaching, advising, assessment, and creating long-lasting research-backed programs to promote minoritized undergraduate and graduate student success.<img alt="lorato-anderson.png" class="" height="150" src="images/lorato-anderson.png" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" width="250"/></p>
<p>Lorato has worked on campus for five years and received the 2020 Outstanding Staff Achievement Award in Social Sciences.

She starts work in the Graduate Division on February 7, 2022.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Peter Biehl, Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2bc1ebf9807270462612537c4cea9c8f"><name>ping-career-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Materials theorist Yuan Ping wins NSF CAREER Award</title><summary>Yuan Ping, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, has received a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support her work on quantum information science.</summary><start-date>1641369600000</start-date><display-name>Materials theorist Yuan Ping wins NSF CAREER Award</display-name><path>/2022/01/ping-career-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/01/ping-career-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1641411636200</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1641411897753</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/yuan-ping-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/yuan-ping-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yuan-ping-300.jpg</name><display-name>yuan-ping-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>58076</file-size><width>300</width><height>344</height></image><image-alt>Yuan Ping</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/03/images/yuan-ping-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/03/images/yuan-ping-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yuan-ping-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>yuan-ping-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22112</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Yuan Ping</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Yuan Ping</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Yuan Ping, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, has received a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support her work developing computational platforms to investigate the physics of new materials for quantum computers and other applications of quantum information science.</p>
<p>In quantum computers, information is encoded in quantum bits, or qubits, which can be made from any quantum system that has two states. One promising approach is based on the spin states of electrons. Ping&#8217;s group has developed a theoretical framework and computational tools for predicting spin dynamics in solid-state materials, which they will use to study the properties of spin qubits.</p>
<p>Critical properties of spin qubits include quantum coherence, which determines how long the spin state will last (or how long the encoded information will be intact); readout efficiency, which determines the fidelity with which information can be extracted from a qubit; and quantum transduction, which determines if quantum information can be transferred and communicated among qubits over a long range.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understanding kinetics of excited states and spin qubit relaxation and decoherence is the core issue of spin-based quantum information science,&#8221; Ping said. &#8220;In this project, we will develop a computational platform to tackle these issues for spin qubits.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of these properties are materials-specific, and previous efforts have relied mostly on simplified models which require inputs from prior experiments. Ping&#8217;s first-principles approach will eliminate the need for prior input parameters and will open the path for designing novel quantum materials with the potential to enable unprecedented performance for applications in quantum information science.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stable, scalable, and reliable quantum information science has the potential to transform and advance knowledge across a large number of critical fields through next-generation technologies for sensing, computing, modeling, and communicating,&#8221; Ping said.</p>
<p>The funding for this project also includes support for a range of education and outreach activities. These include strengthening undergraduate education in physical chemistry through a summer bootcamp; developing computational materials research through new courses and undergraduate research programs; and supporting women and underrepresented groups through UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://wiseucsc.wixsite.com/wise">Women in Science and Engineering</a> program.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2c9db62c807270462612537c4b4d936a"><name>obama-conversation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Legal studies major Aissata Ba looks back on the “whirlwind” of meeting Michelle Obama at recent event</title><summary>Aissata Ba, a 20-year-old Black Muslim first-generation American, was among a group of students brought together to be part of a conversation with Michelle Obama on some of the themes addressed in her best-selling memoir.</summary><start-date>1641369600000</start-date><display-name>Event with Michelle Obama</display-name><path>/2022/01/obama-conversation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/01/obama-conversation</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1641426040341</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1643222010512</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Robert Ham</name><title></title><phone/><email>rmham@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/01/images/obama-ba-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/01/images/obama-ba-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>obama-ba-500px.jpg</name><display-name>obama-ba-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>175766</file-size><width>500</width><height>281</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/01/images/obama-group-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/01/images/obama-group-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>obama-group-80px.jpg</name><display-name>obama-group-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>17279</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Aissata Ba was among the students who participated a conversation last year with Michelle Obama.

<p>&#8220;It was a really spur-of-the-moment decision,&#8221; Ba said. &#8220;I thought there was no chance that I would get selected because UC Santa Cruz is a big school. But I wanted to take a chance anyway. You never know what comes out of these things.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bet.com/episodes/yjlx38/bet-her-presents-becoming-michelle-obama-in-conversation-bet-her-presents-becoming-michelle-obama-in-conversation-ep-1"><strong>Watch&#160;<em>BET Her Presents&#8230;Becoming: Michelle Obama In Conversation</em></strong></a></p>
<p>Ba, a 20-year-old Black Muslim first-generation American, was chosen from among a competitive pool of applicants to visit Prince George&#8217;s Community College in Maryland where she and a handful of other college students from around the United States were brought together to be part of a conversation with Michelle Obama on some of the themes addressed in her best-selling memoir <em>Becoming</em>. UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/">The Humanities Institute</a> (THI) set up this opportunity for Ba and sponsored her travel and accommodation. THI also gave 500 free copies of <em>Becoming</em> to members of the UC Santa Cruz community and facilitated the campus&#8217;s participation in the exclusive live streaming event as part of the institute&#8217;s 2021&#8211;2022 theme, <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/imagination/">Imagination</a>. Across UC Santa Cruz, people tuned in to watch Ba and the special cohort of selected students talk with Obama about challenges they were facing and ways to build a better future.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that we were talking about was the experience of being a first generation college student,&#8221; Ba remembered, &#8220;and feelings of imposter syndrome. Also, the question that was brought up that was really interesting of how you can bring about change outside the political system. She talked about fueling and homing in on your own passions. I really liked her response to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ba is already well ahead of the curve when it comes to keeping the flame of her personal passions lit. From her years living in Orange County to her move to Santa Cruz, she has made an impressive name for herself via her various social media accounts where she discusses the books that she&#8217;s reading and shares little snippets of her life. It has garnered Ba thousands of followers to her Twitter and Instagram accounts, and over 10,000 subscribers to her YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Ba filmed a wealth of material from the trip to Maryland, both for her own channels and for an Instagram takeover for Better Make Room, the nonprofit organization, founded by Michelle Obama, that offers resources and encouragement for young high schoolers applying to colleges and universities. All of that content will go live in advance of the Jan. 17 premiere of <a href="https://twitter.com/BET/status/1478773456334372869"><em>BET Her Presents&#8230;Becoming: Michelle Obama In Conversation</em></a>, a TV special about the event that airs on BET and BET Her.</p>
<p>As Ba sees it, this event and much of the work that Michelle Obama has been doing since her family departed the White House in 2016 is about investing in the lives and futures of young Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It felt like she wanted to be there having a conversation as much as we did,&#8221; Ba said. &#8220;She wanted to hear our stories as much as we wanted to hear her insight. She talked about how she does have hope in our generation and young people to bring forth change that may not have been possible in her day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The experience of being part of the event last month is still sinking in for Ba. She only had about a week to prepare herself to fly to Maryland and she was back in Santa Cruz soon after. Even so, meeting a public figure that has been a source of inspiration and connecting with an exceptional group of peers from around the country clearly left a deep impression on Ba.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels surreal,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was so amazing to be able to meet different students from other schools that had such different perspectives. And just the experience of speaking with Michelle Obama and [actor] Yara Shahidi, I learned a lot. It was such an eye-opening experience and definitely one that I will treasure for a lifetime.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/01/images/obama-ba-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/01/images/obama-ba-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>obama-ba-featured.jpg</name><display-name>obama-ba-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>32724</file-size><width>590</width><height>240</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Aissata Ba was among the students who participated a conversation last year with Michelle </thumb-alt><title>Aissata Ba: Meeting Michelle</title><description>Aissata Ba, a second-year legal studies major, was chosen from among a competitive pool of applicants to be part of a conversation with Michelle Obama on some of the themes addressed in Obama's best-selling memoir Becoming.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="319c9a7a807270462612537cd4f02b89"><name>ibeanusi-patsy-takemoto-mink-scholarship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Undergraduate Pearl Ibeanusi wins national scholarship in honor of late U.S. Rep.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The award honors the memory of Patsy Takemoto Mink, who was the first woman of color elected to Congress. She served 12 terms for Hawaii in the U.S. House of Representatives and was a tireless advocate for women&#8217;s rights and civil rights. In 2014, Mink was awarded a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom. She famously coauthored Title IX, a law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in any federally funded educational programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Patsy Takemoto Mink Education Foundation provides financial awards to help low-income mothers pursue post-secondary education. The foundation receives thousands of applications from across the country, but in late 2021, UCSC student Pearl Ibeanusi was one of five women selected to receive a $5,000 scholarship. The award recognizes Ibeanusi&#8217;s outstanding record of community service and her educational and career goals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her time at UCSC, Ibeanusi has served on a student panel for incoming freshmen through </span><a href="https://engagingeducation.org/umoja"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Umoja</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support the success of African, Black, and Caribbean students on campus, and in 2020, on behalf of the Community Studies Program, she attended the Facing Race national conference on racial justice. She was also selected as a 2020-2021 UC Global Health Institute student ambassador.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, she won the Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Award through UCSC&#8217;s Division of Social Sciences, a scholarship which recognizes students committed to social issues and public service. And most recently, she completed a field study internship with the City of San Jos&#233;, where she worked with pandemic-related eviction protection programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ibeanusi hopes to pursue graduate education and envisions a public service leadership career that would allow her to address equity issues at the intersection of education and health.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m very interested in behavioral health, and there is more to that than what can be found with labs and blood tests and x-ray images,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If a person can&#8217;t afford to live in a good neighborhood, to have transportation, to eat good food and sleep well, or to get an education that can help them improve their lifestyle and reach their goals, then they are facing crippling factors that will affect their health, even if it&#8217;s not found in the biomedical arena.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a mother of six, a cancer survivor, and a first-generation immigrant who came to the U.S. from Nigeria 30 years ago, Ibeanusi says financial struggles have been a constant challenge in attaining her own educational and career goals. But scholarships, like the one from the Patsy Takemoto Mink Education Foundation, can help to put those dreams within reach.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful and honored by the foundation&#8217;s decision to count me as an awardee,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I really need this type of financial support in order to continue my education, and this award is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">motivational, because it shows that if I keep going and keep up the hard work, it can pay off.&#8221;</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="321538d6807270462612537c29ffdf5a"><name>delaying-in-person-instruction</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Delaying in-person instruction until Jan. 31</title><summary>After consultation with academic and administrative leaders on our campus, at other UC campuses, and with our health center staff, we have made the difficult decision to extend alternate and remote modes of instruction for two additional weeks</summary><start-date>1641456000000</start-date><display-name>Delaying in-person instruction until Jan. 31</display-name><path>/2022/01/delaying-in-person-instruction</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/01/delaying-in-person-instruction</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1641517758662</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662581596363</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>We resumed our campus COVID-19 testing program Sunday and after running more than 3,000 tests, our campus positivity rate is at 5 percent, which is the highest it has been since we began testing, though it also remains well below the state and county rates.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span><span class="c-mrkdwn__br" data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"></span><span>We remain committed to supporting the well-being of our campus community. After consultation with academic and administrative leaders on our campus, at other UC campuses, and with our health center staff, we have made the difficult decision to extend alternate and remote modes of instruction for two additional weeks. </span></p>
<p><span>We also recommend faculty and staff hold meetings and events remotely during this time.&#160;</span><span class="c-mrkdwn__br" data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"></span><span>We plan to resume in-person instruction Jan. 31, the day our booster deadline goes into effect.

<p><span class="c-mrkdwn__br" data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"></span><span>If possible, students who live on campus and have not yet returned should not return to campus this weekend. We will provide additional information next week about a phased return for residential students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span class="c-mrkdwn__br" data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"></span><span>We made this difficult decision to delay in-person instruction with the well-being of our campus and broader community in mind, so that we are in a better position to successfully resume and maintain in-person instruction this quarter, and to ensure the continued operation of our campus. When we first announced remote instruction for the start of winter quarter, we expected to see an increase in positive cases, but the rate at which this variant is spreading requires us to update our plans.</span></p>
<p><span class="c-mrkdwn__br" data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"></span><span>Our plan to repopulate the campus continues to be based on pre-arrival testing, post-arrival testing, and strengthening our community&#8217;s resistance to the virus by requiring vaccine booster shots. These mitigations&#8212;along with appropriate indoor masking with N95, KN95, KN94, or a surgical mask underneath a cloth mask&#8212;will be key to a successful quarter. The campus mask mandate remains in effect, and California has extended its mask mandate to at least Feb. 15. Because this variant is highly contagious, we strongly urge you to upgrade your masks as recommended by the California Department of Public Health. We urge you to shift from cloth masks to higher quality ones that do a better job of reducing transmission.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span class="c-mrkdwn__br" data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"></span><span>We encourage all eligible faculty, staff, and students to get their COVID booster shot as soon as possible, recognizing that the shots can take up to two weeks to provide maximum protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="c-mrkdwn__br" data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"></span><span>In addition to carefully managing our campus isolation space, we recognize that, like our Student Health Center, the health care system in our greater county community is yet again facing a tremendous burden as infections increase rapidly and hospitalizations rise as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="c-mrkdwn__br" data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"></span><span>For some in our community, this extension of remote instruction will be a relief, and for others, a disappointment. We understand both perspectives, and look forward to a time when our world is not so constrained by COVID-19.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span class="c-mrkdwn__br" data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"></span><span>We deeply appreciate everyone&#8217;s patience and flexibility as we collectively address the unexpected challenges caused by the pandemic. We are especially grateful to the many staff members whose diligent work is supporting our students and the campus. The well-being of our campus community remains a top priority as we continue to monitor COVID-19 developments, and we will continue to share information as it becomes available to keep everyone informed and updated on our plans.</span></p>

UC Santa Cruz resumed its on-campus testing program Sunday, which shows we have been experiencing a sharp increase in COVID-19 positive cases, similar to the rest of California, due to the rise of the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>For this reason, in consultation with academic and administrative leaders on our campus, at other UC campuses, and with UCSC health center staff, we have made the difficult decision to delay in-person instruction by an additional two weeks. <strong>This means that we will continue with alternate and remote modes of instruction until Jan. 31, which is the date of the campus&#8217;s COVID booster deadline.</strong> You may be aware that many of the other UC campuses have announced similar decisions.</p>
<p>I realize that many of you will be relieved to hear this news, while others will be understandably upset. I can assure you that we did not come to this decision lightly, and this is not how our campus community had hoped the winter quarter would begin. But if we have learned anything over the past two years, it&#8217;s that this pandemic is extremely unpredictable, and that we must remain nimble and flexible for the well-being of our entire campus community, including our students. As a parent and a grandmother myself, I know how difficult this time must be for you and your student.</p>
<p><strong>If your student has already returned to UCSC</strong>, I want to assure you that our campus student operations are available, including Dining, Housing, the University Library, and other student services. UC Santa Cruz classrooms are available for students needing a place to participate in remote instruction or study.

The inset at the lower-right zooms into one of the squares of Roman's footprint, and the inset at the lower-left zooms in even further. The image, which contains more than 10 million galaxies, was constructed from a simulation that produced a realistic distribution of the galaxies in the universe. Roman could peer across more than 13 billion years of cosmic history, reaching back to when the universe was only about half a billion years old. Such distant galaxies are extremely faint, so Roman would have to stare at one spot in space for several days to collect enough light from them. The mission&#8217;s wide field of view will provide an incredible amount of data, helping astronomers find rare objects.

This Hubble observation transformed our view of the early universe, revealing galaxies that formed just a few hundred million years after the big bang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roman has the unique ability to image very large areas of the sky, which allows us to see the environments around galaxies in the early universe,&#8221; said Nicole Drakos, a postdoctoral scholar at UC Santa Cruz, who led the study. &#8220;Our study helps demonstrate what a Roman ultra-deep field could tell us about the universe, while providing a tool for the scientific community to extract the most value from such a program.&#8221;</p>
<p>By capturing the <a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2014/27/3380-Image.html">Hubble Ultra Deep Field image</a>, astronomers pulled aside the cosmic curtains to reveal that a tiny, seemingly empty slice of the sky was actually teeming with thousands of galaxies, each containing billions of stars. The Hubble team harnessed the power of a long exposure time&#8212;hundreds of hours between 2002 and 2012&#8212;which allowed the telescope to collect more light than it could in a single, short observation. The resulting image helped us see more than 13 billion years back in time.</p>
<p>Hubble&#8217;s Ultra Deep Field offers an incredible window to the early universe, but an extremely narrow one, covering less than one ten millionth of the whole sky. The new simulation showcases Roman&#8217;s power to perform a similar observation on a much larger scale, revealing millions of galaxies instead of thousands. While a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/roman-space-telescope-could-image-100-hubble-ultra-deep-fields-at-once">Roman ultra-deep field</a> would be just as sharp as Hubble&#8217;s and peer equally far back in time, it could reveal an area 300 times larger, offering a much broader view of cosmic ecosystems.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hubble Ultra Deep Field gave us a glimpse of the universe&#8217;s youth, but it was too small to reveal much information about what the cosmos was really like back then as a whole,&#8221; said coauthor Brant Robertson, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;It&#8217;s like looking at a single piece of a 10,000-piece puzzle. Roman could give us 100 connected puzzle pieces, offering a much better picture of what the early universe was like and opening up new scientific opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>To generate their simulated Roman ultra-deep field image, Drakos and her coauthors created a synthetic catalog of galaxies, complete with detailed information about each one. By doing so, the team essentially created a mock universe, basing their synthetic galaxies on dark matter simulations and observation-based models. They made the galaxy catalog publicly available so other scientists can use it to prepare for future Roman observations. The team also created an <a href="http://slate.ucsc.edu/&#126;brant/dream/current">interactive website</a> where users can zoom and pan across the full-resolution image.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s results will be published in the <em>Astrophysical Journal.</em></p>
<h2>Looking far and wide</h2>
<p>Astronomers usually have to choose between taking a shallow, wide-area image and capturing a very sensitive, deep image since telescope time is a precious commodity. But with Roman&#8217;s enormous field of view and infrared vision, they will be able to peer far and wide simultaneously, opening up new avenues of cosmic exploration. The Roman Space Telescope is slated to launch in the mid-2020s.</p>
<p>Drakos and her coauthors showed that a Roman ultra-deep field program could reveal more than a million galaxies scattered throughout cosmic history, from very young and small galaxies just beginning to form stars to the modern era, which features many massive, often relatively inactive galaxies. Scientists would be able to probe how galaxies transition from forming lots of new stars to this quieter stage, when star formation is complete.</p>
<p>The possible causes of this metamorphosis are currently poorly understood, but Roman&#8217;s wide viewing power could offer clues about how a galaxy&#8217;s environment, such as its location in relation to other galaxies or galaxy clusters, affects its star formation.</p>
<p>Galaxies in which star formation has ended, known as quiescent galaxies, are increasingly difficult to find the farther back in time astronomers look.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not sure whether we haven&#8217;t detected very distant quiescent galaxies because they don&#8217;t exist, or simply because they&#8217;re so difficult to find,&#8221; Drakos said.</p>
<p>Drakos and coauthors showed that Roman&#8217;s ability to image large patches of the distant universe and reveal both rare and faint objects could help astronomers find as many as 100,000 quiescent galaxies, likely including some of the farthest ones ever discovered. Astronomers could also use Roman ultra-deep field observations to determine whether galaxies transition from star-forming to quiescent differently in different cosmic eras.</p>
<h2>The end of the cosmic &#8220;dark ages&#8221;</h2>
<p>The team&#8217;s work shows that Roman could illuminate our understanding of a long-ago cosmic event called reionization. Shortly after the big bang, the universe was filled with a hot sea of plasma&#8212;charged particles&#8212;that formed a dense, ionized fluid. As the universe cooled, the particles were able to stick together to form hydrogen atoms, which resulted in a neutral hydrogen fog. This marked an era called the cosmic &#8220;dark ages&#8221; since this fog prevented shorter wavelengths of light, which may have been emitted from young, forming galaxies or quasars from traveling very far.</p>
<p>But then the neutral hydrogen atoms broke apart, returning to charged particles in an epoch of reionization. The fog lifted, transforming the universe from being mostly opaque to the brilliant starscape we see today. Findings from NASA&#8217;s Spitzer Space Telescope hint that the first galaxies released extremely high amounts of ionizing radiation&#8212;ultraviolet light, x-rays, and gamma rays&#8212;which could have disrupted the hydrogen fog.</p>
<p>A Roman ultra-deep field program could advance our understanding of the epoch of reionization by revealing wide images containing more than 10,000 galaxies from this relatively brief cosmic age, which happened sometime between when the universe was around 600 million to 900 million years old, and a detailed view of the environments around these galaxies. This could help scientists understand what caused reionization, when exactly it happened, and whether its occurrence was uniform or patchy.</p>
<p>Roman also has the power to reveal how galaxies and galaxy clusters&#8212;which form some of the largest structures in the universe&#8212;evolved over time. Scientists think galaxies were born within vast spherical clumps of dark matter called halos. Observations indicate that each galaxy&#8217;s luminosity, or absolute brightness, is linked to the mass of the dark matter halo it resides in. By creating an ultra-deep field image, Roman could help astronomers better understand this connection. This has implications for not only galaxy formation but also the standard cosmological model&#8212;the theoretical model of how the universe evolves&#8212;which includes a dark matter clumping parameter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roman could shine a light on so many cosmic mysteries in just a few hundred hours of observing time,&#8221; said coauthor Bruno Villasenor, a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to think that no one knew for sure whether other galaxies existed until about a hundred years ago. Now, Roman offers us the opportunity to observe thousands of the first galaxies that appeared in the very early universe!&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bradley-Armstrong is a dedicated student affairs professional with 17 years of experience in the field. She comes to UCSC from the University of Colorado Boulder, where she has supported student success since 2016, most recently as Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. She is also a faculty affiliate in CU Boulder&#8217;s Masters in Higher Education program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bradley-Armstrong&#8217;s appointment at UCSC, which begins May 16, concludes a national recruitment effort and campuswide stakeholder engagement process that began in May 2021. University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell and Cowell College Provost Alan Christy&#160; co-chaired the search advisory committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Akirah will be a powerful advocate for our students and a great addition to our campus community,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;I look forward to welcoming her to our leadership team. I&#8217;m grateful for the hard work of our search advisory committee and appreciative of everyone in our community who shared their thoughtful insights during the recruitment."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bradley-Armstrong brings to her new role a wealth of experience in supporting student retention; providing safe space and community for underrepresented students; supporting freedom of speech; ensuring student wellness; and providing for student development and basic needs. She says that part of what drew her to UC Santa Cruz was seeing how passionate the campus community is about student support and success.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m really excited to be able to work with the brilliant staff and faculty at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are a lot of great programs and ideas here. I also feel really excited to work with this student body. I like a student body that&#8217;s going to push for positive change. It makes us think critically about the work that we&#8217;re doing, and it keeps us on our toes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of her career, Bradley-Armstrong has held leadership positions in student affairs at CU Boulder, UC Berkeley, the University of Vermont, and Semester at Sea. She earned her Ed.D. in Educational Leadership from UC Davis, where she conducted dissertation research on crisis response and support systems in higher education administration. A first-generation college student, she also holds a master of education degree from the University of Vermont and a bachelor of science in Business Administration from Mansfield University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bradley-Armstrong says the values she&#8217;ll focus on in her new role as vice chancellor include equity, integrity, authenticity, collaboration, compassion, action, and fun. One of her priorities when she arrives will be listening, learning, and observing to guide the creation of a shared vision for the future of the Division of Student Affairs and Success.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;d like to uplift a collective </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">vision of not only how we take care of students, but how we can take care of one another and our campus,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That vision is about defining our future. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do we want student affairs to look like at UC Santa Cruz, what do we want to be known for, and what can we contribute nationally to the field?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bradley-Armstrong&#8217;s passion for student affairs work comes in part from her own experiences as a first-generation college graduate and her identity as a queer Black womyn. During her undergraduate education, she experienced incidents of bias that set her on a mission to create change within higher education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wanted to figure out how I could shift policies, programs, and procedures within the education system, and how I could be at the table representing voices that weren&#8217;t typically included in those conversations,&#8221; she said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe there&#8217;s more we need to be doing in higher education to support students who look like me and to support all students who are underrepresented in other ways on campus."<br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bradley-Armstrong says she looks forward to receiving open, direct input and feedback from colleagues and the broader campus community on crucial student-support issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s have the tough conversations that will help us grow,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If we&#8217;re not able to go there, we&#8217;re not really going to move the needle. I want to ensure that the folks who I&#8217;m working with trust my leadership and feel proud to be within student affairs or to be our partner."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Bradley-Armstrong&#8217;s appointment, Interim Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success Jennifer Baszile will serve as Associate Chancellor for Strategic Initiatives and Educational Partnerships continuing her work to advance equity in student success at UCSC and forging collaborative partnerships with other higher education institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baszile assumed the role as interim vice chancellor of the division starting in July 2020, serving during a critical transition period for the division. Her leadership has been instrumental over the past year and half, increasing student support and expanding the division&#8217;s scope and offerings. She will remain a valued member of the UC Santa Cruz leadership team.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="45287fa4807270462612537c3ea1717a"><name>vc-student-affairs-success</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Announcing the appointment of Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success</title><summary>We are excited to announce that Akirah J.

<p>Kevin Bundy, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, is MaNGA&#8217;s principal investigator.</p>
<p>&#8220;Observing such a large sample with MaNGA allows us to see how the detailed internal properties of galaxies vary in systematic ways with other factors, like galaxy mass or where galaxies live in the universe,&#8221; Bundy said. &#8220;These patterns are the key to understanding the physical processes that shape galaxy evolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>MaNGA is a special kind of galaxy survey, using an innovative fiber-bundling technology to make detailed spectral maps of thousands of nearby galaxies. Spectra are graphs that show the amount of light given off by a galaxy at different wavelengths, much like a rainbow shows the amount of sunlight in various colors. Most previous galaxy surveys have either taken detailed images in one or a handful of colors, or measured just a single spectrum for an entire galaxy, but MaNGA works differently.</p>
<p>With fiber-optic cables bundled into tightly-packed hexagonal arrays, the team measured spectra at tens to hundreds of separate points in each galaxy, resulting in a &#8220;datacube&#8221; containing full spectroscopic information at each point. MaNGA was able to observe seventeen galaxies at once, while similar surveys could only observe one galaxy at a time. Six years of observing in this mode created the largest sample size of this kind ever obtained.</p>
<p>Researchers study each data cube to reveal its galaxy&#8217;s detailed chemical composition; find the ages, chemical makeup, and motions of the stars inside it; and map ionized interstellar gas. MaNGA has created over 30 different maps for each galaxy. These maps can be used for lots of different applications, for example, to estimate how many baby stars are being formed at every position in the galaxy, or to find the influence of the central supermassive black hole. MaNGA dramatically increases the number of galaxies with this detailed information, and a sister project, the MaNGA Stellar Library (MaStar), helped it along.</p>
<p>Galaxies are made of stars, so understanding them in detail requires a detailed library of spectra of stars. Alongside the complete release of MaNGA, SDSS scientists announced the completion of MaStar, which made use of otherwise unused time on the MaNGA instrument to observe over 24,000 stars, enabling the scientists to more accurately extract information from the MaNGA data.</p>
<p>The leader of the MaStar project, Renbin Yan of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, explained, &#8220;MaStar is a special kind of library that includes spectra for as many types of stars as possible. Using these data, we can figure out how many of each type of star add up to make each of the many spectra from a MaNGA galaxy and reconstruct the most accurate view ever of when and where stars formed in that galaxy&#8217;s cosmic history.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, MaNGA data have been used to make movies showing how the location where baby stars form moves around through spiral arms and other features in galaxies. Identifying which spectra came from which internal structure turns out to be tricky for computers, but with the help of citizen scientists, the MaNGA team have been able to do this, providing in this release maps showing where the structures are. And the kinematics of galaxies can reveal previously unknown galaxy interactions.</p>
<p>All of this MaNGA data has been made publicly available, and the SDSS team have also created a specially designed tool dubbed &#8220;Marvin&#8221; to help with data access. Marvin allows anyone to have a quick look at the data of each galaxy in an easy-to-use web interface, and is also available as a powerful set of python modules which allow anyone familiar with coding to access and visualize this complex data. Brian Cherinka at the Space Telescope Science Institute, one of the lead developers of Marvin, explains, &#8220;Marvin was designed specifically to access the complex MaNGA data and help researchers to avoid some of the common pitfalls in data visualization and access.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using MaNGA data and an early version of Marvin, scientists have already been discovering many new things about galaxies, with over 500 papers already published using the data. For example, MaNGA team members discovered a new class of galaxy, dubbed a red geyser, in which outflows from the supermassive black hole, revealed in MaNGA maps of ionized gas, are preventing new stars from forming. And to scientists' surprise, this happens even in the smallest galaxies.</p>
<p>Making MaNGA data publicly available and accessible will fuel science analyses for years to come and puts the full power of MaNGA data into the hands of anyone who wants to use it. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to us that the data is not just available, but also accessible, so that anyone with an interest in galaxies can use MaNGA data for their research, education, or just for fun, can explore the cubes, spectra, and maps to learn more about these galaxies,&#8221; said Anne-Marie Weijmans of the University of St. Andrews, who led the part of the SDSS team in charge of data releases. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to be a galaxy expert to work with MaNGA data: we have many tutorials on our website to get you started.&#8221;</p>
<p>The instrumentation innovations developed for MaNGA will reverberate into the future. The next generation of SDSS (SDSS-V) is expanding on the novel fiber-packing methods developed for MaNGA to construct even larger fiber bundles for its Local Volume Mapper program. This survey will also study gas and newly-formed stars, but in an environment much closer to home&#8212;our own Milky Way and its nearby smaller neighbors. By combining these data with what MaNGA has learned from thousands of more distant galaxies, astronomers will gain a much deeper understanding of how gas and stars coexist and interact throughout a galaxy&#8217;s lifetime.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/01/manga-data-release.html</url><title>MaNGA data release includes detailed maps of thousands of nearby galaxies</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="50b564e9807270462612537c7890ee47"><name>housing-assignment-survey</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Winter Quarter Update - Residential Students</title><summary>Urgent response requested from All UCSC residential students.&#13;

<p dir="ltr"><span>Employees may be granted up to four hours of paid time off to obtain their vaccine or booster shots. This applies to the vaccine and/or booster appointments that are available on-campus or off-campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Non-exempt employees may use up to four hours of EPSL or have &#8220;release time&#8221; per dose of each vaccine, which means 4 hours per shot (8 hours if a 2-dose regimen) and 4 hours for a booster. If employees don't have EPSL banks, they just get release time. They should note it as "COVID vaccine" or "COVID booster" on their CruzPay sheet.&#160;</span></p>

He was surrounded by professors who were noted Africa scholars, including the late John Marcum.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Cox, a documentary filmmaker, is inspiring a new generation of students to take an interest in the continent by helping organize cultural exchanges through <a href="https://merrill.ucsc.edu/index.html">Merrill College</a>. Merrill is offering two Global Classrooms &#8211; courses developed with the support of the <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu">Global Engagement division</a> that involve online collaboration between students from UC Santa Cruz and the Co-Operative University of Kenya. Merrill is also organizing a faculty-led study abroad program in Africa in summer 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cox, who teaches the &#8220;Focus on Africa&#8221; Global Classroom and has taken students to Africa, said he is passionate about raising the profile of the continent in the psyche of the average American.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to recreate a constituency for Africa both on campus at UC Santa Cruz and in the home communities of the students who are participating,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Focus on Africa&#8221; is a two-credit course that is intended to equip students &#8220;with the skills and background necessary to be informed observers and chroniclers of current affairs on the African continent.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cox has drawn on more than 30 years of contacts to put together the course and to develop the material. The online collaboration involving international students has been a godsend, he said. He hopes that alliances will be formed there that will last the students a lifetime. &#8220;If nothing else, these students will walk away with a much better understanding of how truly interconnected our world is,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jesus Membrillo Ortiz, a UC Santa Cruz student in &#8220;Focus on Africa,&#8221; said he has learned from the Kenyan students in the class that their experiences are similar to what he experienced as a child growing up in Mexico. Both areas have widespread poverty and a colonial history that resulted in oppression of the native population.&#160; &#8220;Everything they describe is very similar,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mexico is a Third World country. We understand Africa, it&#8217;s the same thing."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ortiz said he became interested in Africa because there was a big Afro-Mexican community in Jalisco where he grew up. He would like to help get more investors interested in Africa and help bring electricity to those on the continent that don&#8217;t have it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma Castleberry, another UC Santa Cruz student in the class, said she has gained a different experience on current events from the Kenyan students, including learning about the November suicide bombings in the Ugandan capital of Kampala. She said it was also interesting hearing the students&#8217; experiences dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. The Kenyan students talked about the continent&#8217;s low vaccination rate and how some leaders have spread false information about vaccines.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cox will lead another &#8220;Focus on Africa&#8221; Global Classroom this summer which will include an in-depth study of the Kenya General Election slated for Aug. 9. Voters will elect a new president, members of the National Assembly and Senate, county governors and members of 47 county assemblies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other Global Classroom that combines students from UC Santa Cruz and Co-Operative University of Kenya is one section of Merrill 1, the five-credit Merrill Core course. Merrill College Provost Elizabeth Abrams said the students in the course are working to create a &#8220;field guide to understanding the other.&#8221; Students learn how to confidently communicate and engage with others across differences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercy Jebichii Kiprotich, a Kenyan student, said she appreciates the chance to improve her critical thinking skills besides her synthesis skills. She is glad &#8220;to interact with my fellow students from outside my continent and share our ideas together.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abrams, Cox and UC Santa Cruz theater faculty member Patty Gallagher had been planning to fly to Kenya late last year but the plan was canceled due to the Omicron variant.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans are still moving forward to send UC Santa Cruz students and faculty to Kenya in summer 2023 for a study abroad program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cox had a successful experience taking 11 students to South Africa, Tanzania and England in 2015. Olimpia Maderit Blanco-Zuniga, one of the students on the trip, said it was a memorable trip, which included a failed attempt to interview delegates attending the World Economic Forum on Africa,&#160; and a chance to interview doctors about their work on malaria in Tanzania. Blanco-Zuniga remains in touch with Cox and is glad that he is continuing to create connections with UC Santa Cruz and Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been amazing to see Melvin&#8217;s dream come to fruition,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Sabo, director of global initiatives with the Global Engagement division at UC Santa Cruz, said the Africa-focused Global Classroom courses are part of a larger initiative to offer students opportunities to connect with students around the world virtually.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="55dc9a39807270462612537c15440ea6"><name>sartori-andy-mealpro</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Appetite for entrepreneurship leads alum to launch successful meal-prep business</title><summary>Economics alumnus Andy Sartori, a Sacramento Business Journal 40 under 40 honoree, helps people eat with purpose.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andy Sartori (College Nine &#8217;13, economics) is on a mission to help people improve their lives. A weightlifting enthusiast, he is flexing his business muscle&#8212;formed in the Economics Department at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;leading an online meal-prep delivery service that helps people eat with purpose.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MealPro is part of a rapidly accelerating $5 billion industry that is making meal planning and preparation convenient for people of all ages. The knowledge he gained as an economics major at UC Santa Cruz has enabled Sartori to succeed as a CEO and compete in an industry that benefited significantly during the pandemic as restaurant sales plummeted and grocery- and food-delivery service profits soared.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Sartori, his company&#8217;s unique value proposition is its ability to customize each already-cooked meal to a person&#8217;s objectives or caloric intake goals. The website includes real-time measurement tools, like a Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) calculator, which help customers identify daily calorie goals that inform their meal choices.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every person is unique,&#8221; Sartori said. &#8220;One portion size doesn&#8217;t fit all. One person may need more protein or vegetables; one may want low sodium or high carbs. We can create meals specific to an individual&#8217;s caloric needs, meal plan, or dietary restrictions.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At just 29, Sartori&#8217;s entrepreneurial spirit has already garnered attention in the local business scene; he was named a 2021 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sacramento Business Journal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 40 under 40 honoree.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It takes passion to be successful, but following your passion also means sacrifice,&#8221; said Sartori, who left a lucrative cybersecurity job to start his own company. &#8220;The likelihood of MealPro succeeding was somewhere between improbable and impossible, but I followed my passion in a trending market segment where consumer behavior was heading in a positive direction.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He describes his management style as one in which he demands quality, precision, and productivity, from the food that is sourced for meals to the people who prepare it. Sartori has chosen his operations team carefully, relying on technology experts across the globe to ensure his e-commerce operation runs efficiently and his online storefront provides an excellent user experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a good balance of business and technology skills is key, he says, to competing in the e-commerce ecosphere, which was nearly nonexistent when he started college. In fact, Sartori says, it was the economic duress of the Great Recession in 2008 that prompted him to choose economics as a major&#8212;he wanted to be part of the solution. He credits experiences in and out of the UCSC classrooms for preparing him for the business world. &#8220;I learned a lot about the buyer&#8217;s journey in my marketing courses&#8212;Game Theory in particular," Sartori said. "I learned negotiating skills that have helped me with real estate leases and in my work with vendors. During the [2011] NBA Lock Out, the Game Theory course taught us how to predict how a situation would unravel. When I was a teaching assistant, a lot of information was reinforced when I had to teach it to others. In one class we had to present ideas to company executives. That was a great experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sartori said it was an entrepreneurship competition at UC Santa Cruz that planted the seed for MealPro, which operates its distribution center out of Citrus Heights, Calif., and delivers to customers across the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he is early in his career as a business leader, Sartori is putting his mission to serve others into action by mentoring enterprising self-starters through his entrepreneur partnering program for startups. He advises them to build their technology acumen by taking courses in JavaScript, computer programming, and website development. These skills, he says, complement the soft skills, like negotiating, that have helped him achieve success. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="55f6facb807270462612537cf02de0db"><name>hale-galina-climate-change</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Economics professor takes deep dive into challenges and opportunities of climate change</title><summary>The widespread impacts of climate change raise urgent and critical questions.</summary><start-date>1642114800000</start-date><display-name>Economics professor takes deep dive into challenges and opportunities of climate change</display-name><path>/2022/01/hale-galina-climate-change</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/01/hale-galina-climate-change</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1642119756472</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1642119837219</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Faculty Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Paula Hermann</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/01/images/hale-galina.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/01/images/hale-galina.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hale-galina.jpg</name><display-name>hale-galina.jpg</display-name><file-size>85009</file-size><width>324</width><height>324</height></image><image-alt> Economics Professor Galina Hale </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/01/images/hale-galina-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/01/images/hale-galina-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hale-galina-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>hale-galina-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>10843</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt> Economics Professor Galina Hale </image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Economics Professor Galina Hale&#160;</span></p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The widespread impacts of climate change raise urgent and critical questions
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are extreme weather events causing farmers to lose access to credit? Are they causing global enterprises to move business locations to dodge physical and economic catastrophes? Will a sudden turn in investment trends away from carbon industries cause a major financial crisis? These questions are guiding the research professor Galina Hale, Ph.D., is exploring along with her Ph.D. students. They are also driving contemplative discussions in her undergraduate and graduate classes in the Department of Economics, which has been ranked sixth in the world among academic departments in international finance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The worlds of economics and climate change science are colliding,&#8221; says Hale, who spent 14 years as an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and held teaching positions at Yale, Stanford, and UC Berkeley. She began her career in Russia as a consultant for the Russian Ministry of Finance. She joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her interest in work that intersects climate change and economics was inspired a few years ago by her presence at the second Network for Green Financial Systems (NGFS) conference, where she was the sole representative from the Federal Reserve System.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was just impressed by how people were able to think about climate-related risks in the context of monetary and financial policy and bank supervision,&#8221; said Hale, whose published research up to that moment focused on understanding patterns of international capital flows and international financial crises, international banking, and stability of financial networks. After the NGFS conference, she was trying to find a way to connect her research with her passion for the protection of the environment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love being outdoors, and I&#8217;m passionate about the environment. My husband and I are looking for ways we can help reduce the use of animals for human food consumption, a major contributor to climate change&#8221; said Hale, who also serves as a board member for Animal Charity Evaluators and is a cofounder of Food System Innovations, a group of experts who volunteer to help organizations working to make the world's food system more environmentally sustainable, compassionate, and health-promoting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapping into these interests and her desire to help solve global issues, Hale turned her attention to identifying opportunities for the financial system to mitigate climate risks and to determining ways in which economists can inform policymakers on how to make the food system more sustainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through her research, in which she invites undergraduate and graduate students to participate, she is searching for an answer to whether financial markets are prepared for climate risks. She is investigating whether economic agents&#8212;financial markets specifically&#8212;realize the risks, and if they are placing sufficient probability on those things happening.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitigating climate risk is an existential necessity. But, Hale says, if some changes are unexpected, they can pose a significant risk to global markets. The United Kingdom&#8217;s pledge to reduce coal, and the commitment by the United States to remove high-emission-producing cars, are two examples of such transition risks that could potentially cause rapid and detrimental economic consequences. She is exploring sustainable investing (ESG or Environmental, Social, and Governance), how markets are reacting to or preparing for enterprises that are moving toward greener methods of production and the manufacturing of environmentally friendly products.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a serious risk of asset prices changing rapidly once it dawns on people that they can&#8217;t have coal or that cars that don&#8217;t run on electricity are of little value,&#8221; explains Hale. &#8220;If financial markets aren&#8217;t prepared for that rapid drop in some asset values, it could have a catastrophic ripple effect on the markets locally and globally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale has also brought to light the multi-billion-dollar impact climate change is having on all areas of the economy. As she explains in a recent study, "What are the Financial Risks from Climate Change?" (</span><a href="https://econofact.org/what-are-the-financial-risks-from-climate-change"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Econofact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, January 21, 2020), &#8220;Agriculture, infrastructure, human health and productivity, tourism, businesses, and financial markets are already affected by extreme weather events becoming more frequent.&#8221; The recent PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing in the aftermath of devastating wildfires in California is one example she uses to make her point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale incorporates her research into her courses, which have spurred multiple climate-related research theses from her students. She is the director of the Master&#8217;s Applied Economics and Finance program, which is unique in that it provides more training in economics, statistics, and econometrics than most traditional M.B.A. programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Silicon Valley companies rely on big data analysis, AI, and machine learning, but they also need talent who can ask the right questions, who are trained to understand the fundamentals of economic systems and can program statistical models," Hale said. "Most M.B.A. programs don&#8217;t get as technical as we do with econometrics and data science.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hale and her colleagues are working on research that is dispersed by the university&#8217;s Center for Analytical Finance (CAFIN), which engages in cutting-edge analysis intended to solve real-world problems of finance in a globalized financial system. The motivation for CAFIN came from the 2008 financial crisis, and its main themes of understanding systemic risks, the impacts of technological innovation in finance, and the challenges of promoting greater financial inclusion, all had their roots in that global shock. Hale is co-directing the center with Professor of Economics Nirvikar Singh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As founding director of the Center for Analytical Finance (CAFIN) at UC Santa Cruz, I was delighted when, in 2020, Galina accepted the invitation to serve as co-director of the center,&#8221; says Singh. &#8220;Galina has played a lead intellectual and organizational role in turning CAFIN&#8217;s attention to the importance of finance in the area of environment, sustainability, and governance (ESG): for example, understanding the risks of climate change and ways of funding prevention and mitigation will be central to making progress in the face of the looming threat. With Galina&#8217;s leadership, CAFIN will be on the frontier of the two most important aspects of global finance&#8212;Fintech and ESG&#8212;for the coming decades.&#8221;UC Investments, which manages University of California investment funds and provides fiduciary oversight, also values the contributions of CAFIN.&#8220;More than seven years ago, UC Investments created a sustainable investment framework for the University of California that has helped guide our thinking about the challenges, and opportunities, of our era and beyond. Our collaboration with CAFIN has helped us keep current on the latest research and innovations that pertain not only to investing, but to how we assess our changing world,&#8221; says Jagdeep Bachher, chief investment officer and vice president of investments for UC Investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This March, CAFIN is collaborating with local universities and financial institutions to present The Fintech: Innovation, Inclusion and Risks Conference 2022</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that will take place at San Francisco State University (SFSU) and will bring together academicians, financial economists, and policy and compliance experts. The conference is co-organized by CAFIN, SFSU, and Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Universities need to be at the table in order to understand the big-picture needs of financial institutions and policymakers, so they can engage their faculty and students in work that will address relevant unsolved problems,&#8221; said Hale, who has a vision for growing the center and the master&#8217;s program in ways that can connect students with alumni and more Silicon Valley enterprises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At UC Santa Cruz, we want the academic ideas to come to the surface and have an impact on what&#8217;s happening in Silicon Valley," she said. "We&#8217;d love to have graduate students attending international conferences and organizing presentations and events at local conferences. We&#8217;d like to engage alumni and policymakers and focus on the needs of our community in finance, education, achieving Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) sustainability&#8212;issues that generally are not the focus of academic financial centers. There is so much potential for us to connect and engage, which would benefit the students, faculty, alumni, and the community.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5a83f7de807270462612537c579999f2"><name>beamer-career-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Computer engineer Scott Beamer wins NSF CAREER Award</title><summary>Scott Beamer, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has received a Faculty Early Career Development Award from the NSF to support his work on verifiable computation.</summary><start-date>1642147200000</start-date><display-name>Computer engineer Scott Beamer wins NSF CAREER Award</display-name><path>/2022/01/beamer-career-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/01/beamer-career-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1642196105164</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1642196303519</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/01/images/scott-beamer-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/01/images/scott-beamer-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>scott-beamer-350.jpg</name><display-name>scott-beamer-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>93884</file-size><width>350</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>Scott Beamer</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/01/images/scott-beamer-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/01/images/scott-beamer-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>scott-beamer-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>scott-beamer-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21385</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Scott Beamer</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Scott Beamer</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Scott Beamer, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has received a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support his work on verifiable computation.</p>
<p>Verifiable computation allows users to verify the results of outsourced computations. With cloud computing, relatively weak devices (phones, laptops, etc.) can run demanding computations on banks of powerful servers operated by a service provider. But can the users trust the results? With verifiable computation, the results are returned along with a proof that they were computed correctly. In practice, however, this approach has not been widely used because it is too computationally expensive.</p>
<p>Beamer&#8217;s project aims to enable verifiable computation using hardware acceleration&#8212;designing hardware to perform a specific function very efficiently. But the rising cost of hardware design complicates the development of specialized hardware. This project attacks both problems by investigating novel hardware architectures to accelerate verifiable computing and agile hardware-design techniques to reduce design costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;This grant will help make verifiable computing a reality, but also improve hardware design productivity. With increased productivity, it will lower the barrier to entry and help democratize computer hardware design,&#8221; Beamer said.</p>
<p>Verifiable computation is a very active and rapidly moving area of research, with enormous implications for society as computation has become increasingly enmeshed in people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Verifiable computation is an important step in building confidence in critical applications like machine learning, blockchain compression, and cloud transfers. Improving hardware acceleration is essential to address these massive computational demands and make verification practical,&#8221; said Alex Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>The funding for this project also includes support for educational and outreach activities to help broaden and grow the hardware-design community.</p>
<p>&#8220;In keeping with Baskin Engineering's core values, this grant integrates educational efforts that help underrepresented college students strengthen their problem-solving skills and broadens the pool of students pursuing graduate study,&#8221; Wolf said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5b2a0a12807270462612537ccd7c0928"><name>svsh-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Update on UC policy and frameworks for responding to sexual violence and sexual harassment </title><summary>Summarized below are the key revisions of the SVSH Policy and its implementing frameworks, the impetus for the changes, and other information of note.&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the UC Office of the President issued further revised versions of those same documents. They were effective January 1, 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later this year, the DOE plans to propose new amendments to the Title IX regulations. The university expects the new amendments will be a significant improvement. In the meantime, UC is making every effort to mitigate harm from the existing regulations, including issuing these revised policies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.ucop.edu/title-ix/resources/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SVSH Policy and frameworks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are important to our ongoing efforts to combat sexual harassment. The Title IX Office and campus partners that participate in stewardship of our SVSH policy have exercised great attention and care to ensure implementation consistent with our&#160; commitment and values.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summarized below are the key revisions, the impetus for the changes, and other information of note.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Senate Bill 493 Changes</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain revisions are to comply with California Senate Bill (SB) 493. This legislation was authored by former Senator Jackson of Santa Barbara and sponsored by Equal Rights Advocates and the Women&#8217;s Foundation of California. It was motivated largely by concerns, which UC shares, about potential adverse effects of the 2020 amendments to the Title IX regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SVSH Policy and implementing frameworks together already codified most of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 493&#8217;s requirements. Revisions are therefore limited. In the SVSH Policy, they include:</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the addition of &#8220;sexual exploitation&#8221; as a form of Prohibited Conduct;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limitations on UC&#8217;s use of no-contact orders to restrict a Complainant&#8217;s contact</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with a Respondent (but not a Respondent&#8217;s contact with a Complainant);</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a requirement that Confidential Resources inform a person who discloses Prohibited Conduct of their right to report to Title IX, and how to do so;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the addition of pastoral counselors as a specified Confidential Resource, and&#8212; in the same section&#8212;a broader reference to &#8220;CARE&#8221; rather than &#8220;CARE Advocates.&#8221; As in the past, these employees are Confidential Resources only when they are acting in their confidential capacity;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a statement that resolution processes under the SVSH Policy are not adversarial;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a statement that Title IX Officers will periodically update parties on the status of investigations;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the addition of certain notice requirements when a Title IX Officer opens an investigation despite a complainant&#8217;s wishes. Note that this happens relatively rarely, when a potential risk to the campus community compels it;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a statement that the Title IX Officer will consider potential systemic remedies after investigations are concluded; and</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a requirement that locations notify volunteers and contractors who regularly interact with students of the SVSH Policy.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Appendix E, Appendix F, the Faculty Framework and the Staff/NFAP Framework, changes include statements that:</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">any evidence available to but not disclosed by a party during an investigation might not be considered at any subsequent hearing;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the very limited circumstances when an investigator or hearing officer determines a party&#8217;s sexual history is relevant, they will explain their determination to the parties in writing;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parties may object, in writing only, to questions asked at a hearing, and submit their objections at the conclusion of the hearing for inclusion in the record; and</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigators and hearing officers are required to exclude questions a party proposes they ask of another party or witness (or, in DOE Grievance Process hearings, asks through their advisor) if the questions are irrelevant, repetitive, or are harassing (in Appendix E) or violate the SVSH rules of conduct (in a DOE Grievance Process); previously, this was discretionary in some instances.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Title IX Regulatory Change</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appendix F, the Faculty Framework and the Staff/NFAP Framework also include revisions in response to one significant provision of the Title IX regulations becoming ineffective. The procedures for resolving conduct covered by the regulations issued last year severely limited the Title IX hearing officer&#8217;s ability to rely on out-of-hearing statements not subject to cross-examination during the hearing. The regulatory provision requiring this limitation is no longer in effect, due to a federal court decision vacating it and DOE&#8217;s subsequent announcement that it would not enforce it. UC included the limitation only because it was legally required at the time. Now that it is not, UC is removing it. Under the revised frameworks, a party or witness&#8217;s unavailability or decision not to answer questions at the hearing now no longer automatically bars the hearing officer from considering the party or witness&#8217;s statements. Rather, the hearing officer will determine whether and how to weigh such statements consistent with the principles and procedures described in the applicable framework.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Clinical Setting Changes</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University has dedicated significant effort and resources to preventing, detecting, and responding to Prohibited Conduct arising from the context of patient care. To further that work, certain revisions are to better account for the clinical context. These revisions were reviewed last year by the President&#8217;s Working Group on SVSH in the Clinical Setting. They primarily include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a requirement that all Responsible Employees report possible Prohibited Conduct that occurs in the context of patient care. Employees with heightened reporting obligations under the current SVSH Policy&#8212;faculty, Human Resources and Academic Personnel administrators, police, managers and supervisors, and Title IX personnel&#8212;already had this obligation;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">modified definitions of Prohibited Conduct that apply when allegations arise in the context of patient care;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a provision that sexual assault during a clinical encounter is considered &#8220;aggravated,&#8221; along with use of force, violence or menace, deliberately causing or taking advantage of incapacitation, and misuse of a complainant&#8217;s image. A determination that conduct is aggravated may affect the corrective action; and</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the addition of examples and of references to University policies and officials, regulations, and regulatory agencies relevant to the clinical setting.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Application of Changes to Current Investigations and Adjudications</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a general matter, in resolution processes under the SVSH Policy, the University applies the SVSH Policy definitions of Prohibited Conduct in place at the time alleged violations of the policy occurred, and the investigation and adjudication procedures (set forth in both the SVSH Policy and the applicable resolution framework) in place at the time the Title IX office charges an investigation. However, in some circumstances, the University will apply revised procedures to resolution processes that are already underway&#8212;specifically, when doing so is required by law or to ensure fairness. Based on these principles, the revised procedures apply as follows:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title IX Regulatory Change. The revisions to Appendix F, the Faculty Framework and Staff/NFAP Framework described above under &#8220;Title IX Regulatory Change,&#8221; apply to cases still in the investigation phase, and to cases in which the investigation is complete but still in the 20-day period for parties to accept or not accept the investigator&#8217;s preliminary determination. The Title IX Offices will notify parties in such cases of this revision, and give parties who have already indicated that whether they accept the opportunity to reconsider.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 493 Changes. The other revisions to Appendix F, the Faculty Framework, and the Staff/NFAP Framework, as well as Appendix E and the procedures in the SVSH Policy &#8211; to comply with SB 493&#8212;apply to any investigation opened on or after the effective date of January 1, 2022, and its subsequent adjudication. For cases already open on that date, the Title IX office will continue using the already-applicable procedures.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, when analyzing alleged conduct during patient care that occurred before January 1, 2022, the University will consider the Prohibited Conduct definitions in place at the time of the alleged conduct as modified by the definitions now codified in Appendix V, when they apply. Note that these definitions are already in use per December 2019 guidance from the Systemwide Title IX Office, and ensure that the particular circumstances of the patient care setting are accounted for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While revisions to these policies are not extensive, and most are legally required, the UC system appreciates the input of stakeholders during the limited management consultation and 90-day formal review for the SVSH Policy. In particular, the university extends its thanks to the Title IX Officers, Academic Senate, Student Conduct directors, CARE directors, Title IX Student Advisory Board, and UC Health colleagues.</span></p>

This situation happened just over three short years since the murderous attack at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, a confrontation that also occurred during Shabbat services. We join with those who are advocating for an investigation of the role antisemitism may have played in motivating the suspect in Colleyville.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We condemn antisemitism and the proliferation of anti-Jewish hate. Rather than allowing hate and those who promote it to divide us, we will continue to stand in community with one another and support the rights of all to gather together in peace and safety.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are all diminished by antisemitic violence. But we can work to come together in community, by recognizing that discriminatory rhetoric can lead to violence, by living our Principles of Community, and by supporting our Jewish family, friends and colleagues who will feel the reverberations of this violent act for some time.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $149,500 grant will be funded through the NEH&#8217;s Humanities Initiatives at Hispanic-Serving Institutions, which looks to develop new humanities programs or strengthen existing courses. Twenty-one percent of incoming freshmen who intend to declare an engineering major self-identify as Hispanic/Latino, according to the Office of Institutional Research, Assessment, and Policy Studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine Alinder, dean of Humanities, serves as the principal investigator on the project with Professor of Linguistics Pranav Anand and Professor of Literature Sean Keilen serving as co-principal investigators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have three goals for the new certificate,&#8221; Alinder said. &#8220;To ensure that our many engineering students use humanistic methods to explore and understand the social, cultural, and historical ramifications of new technologies; make purposeful general education requirements that students now complete haphazardly; and, by introducing engineering students to humanities disciplines earlier, give them options should they change majors, without prolonging their time to degree.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core of this new certificate program will be new courses that will look to expand the perspectives of Baskin Engineering students regarding the effects and potential for positive impact of technology on the planet and its inhabitants. Some classes under consideration for this program include an exploration of the development of communication technologies from throughout human history, a look at how new technology and innovations in science can both boost the voices of the BIPOC community while also reinforcing racial and patriarchal hierarchies, and a course that unpacks ethical and sociopolitical issues surrounding tech. While geared to engineering students, the courses will be open to all UCSC students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These courses will also be deliberately designed to incorporate leading-edge, learner-centered teaching practices through a collaboration between the participating instructors and the Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Literature Professor and CITL Director Jody Greene, who initially proposed the development of a Humanities Certificate for Engineers in 2019, celebrated &#8220;the opportunity to design an entire curriculum from scratch, using what we as a campus have learned about active and engaged pedagogies over the past few years.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene added that this certificate could be a model for new and creative educational opportunities for students that &#8220;draw on UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s long standing interdisciplinary excellence while also honoring its history of educational experimentation and curricular innovation.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate goal is to ensure that Baskin Engineering students can, during their first two years, fulfill their general education requirements with a coherent sequence of classes that are directly relevant to their majors in applied mathematics, electrical and robotics engineering, the computer sciences, and biotechnology. By connecting engineering education with subject areas that resonate with students&#8217; personal and community values, the Certificate in the Humanities has the potential to encourage students from diverse backgrounds to persevere in their chosen engineering fields &#8211; fields in which they have historically been excluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Baskin Engineering programs are intentional about developing the critical and humanistic thinking skills of our students. This certificate will add depth to their understanding of the social and cultural aspects of new technologies,&#8221; said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of this new Certificate in Humanities will begin in earnest this spring, with a planned launch event at the start of the fall 2022 academic year. In the winter of 2024, the faculty plans to introduce a capstone involving team-based&#160; projects that will encourage a cohort of students to join the certificate program together and complete the capstone as a group, reinforcing skills needed in STEM fields.</span></p>

<p>We continue to work toward a resumption of in-person instruction on January 31 for those courses scheduled to be in-person. We appreciate your flexibility in the first four weeks, as the pandemic unfolds in real time. We continue to monitor our positivity rate, status of quarantine and isolation housing, our campus infrastructure of housing, dining, custodial, and transportation, and other relevant indicators. We will take additional actions or make adjustments to our protocols as needed to best serve the wellbeing of our campus and broader community and appreciate your collaboration in these efforts.</p>
<p>We understand that some instructors may seek to continue to teach remotely due to COVID-related circumstances that make in-person instruction infeasible. During our planning for winter quarter instruction, we had not anticipated that the first four weeks would be taught remotely.&#160;<strong>We write here to provide an expanded exception program to which instructors may apply now to continue teaching remotely this winter quarter after the general return to in-person instruction on January 31.</strong><span>&#160;</span>Courses that were originally scheduled as remote or online will continue in that modality throughout the quarter.</p>
<p>We are providing this exception program as a temporary, short-term workplace adjustment, for the<span>&#160;</span><strong>remaining weeks of winter 2022 quarter only</strong><span>&#160;</span>, due to the surge of the highly infectious Omicron variant of COVID19. An instructor or teaching assistant (TA) may request to continue remote instruction exclusively for the remainder of winter 2022 for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instructor/TA with<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/underlying-evidence-table.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642701138454000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3H54Q4id9GMYcamKQWEbrx" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/underlying-evidence-table.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">increased susceptibility to or risk of COVID-19</a>;</li>
<li>Family member or household member with a medical condition that significantly increases risk of or susceptibility to COVID-19;</li>
<li>Family member or household member who is ineligible or otherwise not qualified to be vaccinated.</li>
</ol>
<p>Requests will not be considered based on: i) general caregiving responsibilities (unless the dependent qualifies for #2 or #3 above); ii) the instructor&#8217;s or TA&#8217;s unvaccinated status due to an exemption from the UC systemwide mandate, unless the requester qualifies under reason #1 above; iii) the instructor or TA not living locally.</p>
<p>For requests for a winter 2022 continuation of remote instruction, please contact the chair of your course sponsoring agency by<span>&#160;</span><strong>Monday, January 24, 2022</strong><span>&#160;</span>with your request and a brief explanation of the reason(s) for the request (specific medical conditions do not need to be disclosed) and a brief description of how student learning outcomes will be achieved under a remote format. For most courses, this could simply be a statement of teaching by zoom or creating a flipped class, while a lab or studio course would require more explanation. Your chair will forward this request to the overseeing dean, who has decision authority.</p>
<p>Depending on the initial volume of requests, I anticipate that decisions will be communicated to the instructor and course sponsoring agency chair in writing by Friday, January 28, 2022 unless a need for additional time has been communicated to the instructor or TA.</p>
<p>I want to use this opportunity to remind us of our campus vaccine clinic plans. Being fully vaccinated, including a booster, is the best way to avoid severe illness as the highly infectious Omicron variant continues to spread. Student Health Services will be administering Moderna boosters January 19&#8211;21 from 8:30 a.m.&#8211;4:15 p.m. by<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://studenthealth.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642701138454000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0mnQDTUeLzMuefdRaRwfIi" href="https://studenthealth.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">appointment only</a><span>&#160;</span>at&#160;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stevenson.ucsc.edu/activities/facilities/event-center.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642701138454000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1fISzp1MRAhTeW-3m50_f4" href="https://stevenson.ucsc.edu/activities/facilities/event-center.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stevenson Event Center</a>. The booster is available to all currently enrolled students and employees for free. More vaccine clinic dates will be announced in the days ahead, and more information about clinics and booster eligibility is available via the Student Health Center (<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642701138454000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0frgJ76g8oETpTE6RRn90D" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>The Faculty &amp; Staff Wellness Program in the Office of Risk Services is partnering with Kaiser to provide a COVID-19 Booster Shot Clinic for faculty, staff, and students on Sunday, January 23, at the Stevenson Event Center from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Both Pfizer and Moderna boosters are available. For more information regarding the booster clinic and to sign up for your booster, click here. We continue to deeply appreciate your patience and resilience to the challenges presented by the pandemic. With the additional support and flexibility provided by the process described above, I look forward to the scheduled resumption of in-person instruction in winter quarter.</p>

Smith, assistant professor of literature at UC Santa Cruz, was regularly haunting the stacks of the Biblioteca Amaz&#243;nica, an archive located in Iquitos, the largest city in the Peruvian Amazon, as she researched what would become her first book, <em>Mapping the Amazon: Literary Geography after the Rubber Boom</em> (Liverpool University Press, 2021). And during one of her visits, the librarian Julio Ram&#237;rez beckoned her to a room at the back of the building.</p>
<p>&#8220;He showed me all of these books and journals that were severely damaged,&#8221; Smith remembered. &#8220;As you can imagine, an archive located in the middle of the Amazon rainforest has a lot of problems with humidity. They also have a problem with rodents. The materials were in really bad shape.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith felt like she was being quietly asked to collaborate in the preservation of these rare materials, and the issue weighed on her during her return visits to the Biblioteca Amaz&#243;nica. When she came to UC Santa Cruz, she was introduced to the UCLA Library&#8217;s Modern Endangered Archive Program (MEAP), a project that awards grants to people and organizations working to digitize important historical material in parts of the world without resources to undertake such an effort on their own.</p>
<p>Along with her fellow project leads &#8212; Sydney Silverstein, an anthropologist and assistant professor at the Boonshoft School of Medicine, Wright State University; and Ana Varela Tafur, an independent archivist and poet from Iquitos &#8212; Smith was awarded a $50,000 grant from MEAP to digitize and preserve thousands of documents, newspapers, and other materials of vital historical importance. Her work is also being supported by The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>At the earliest stages of the project beginning as soon as March, Smith and her co-principal investigators will hire a local team and train them on how to use digitization technology to scan and edit images as well as track each item through tagging and metadata. They will also be meeting with the leaders of the Catholic Church in Iquitos to determine a work plan and celebrate the initiation of the project. (The Biblioteca Amaz&#243;nica is overseen by the Catholic Diocese.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The grant money stays locally,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;It provides professional development for the team in Iquitos and then everything that is digitized will be in the public domain and available electronically.&#8221;</p>
<p>The project will concentrate its efforts on those items within the archives that are unique to the Biblioteca Amaz&#243;nica and not available elsewhere. One important inclusion will be back issues of three local newspapers &#8212; El Eco, La Raz&#243;n, and El Oriente &#8212; that have never been fully digitized before.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were key publications for denouncing the crimes of the Amazon rubber boom,&#8221; Smith said.</p>
<p>The team will also digitize 3,000 photographs that were taken in and around Iquitos, many of them featuring images of members of Indigenous communities. This will allow families and community members easy access to these pictures, many of which haven&#8217;t been seen by anyone outside the Biblioteca Amaz&#243;nica staff in decades. Additionally, there are plans to scan over 200 maps of Iquitos and the surrounding area, which will provide researchers and the public a way to see how the region was shaped and changed over the centuries.</p>
<p>While the project is supposed to be wrapped up within two years, Smith is hoping that the librarians and archivists at the Biblioteca Amaz&#243;nica will then be able to continue this important work on their own and grow the digital archive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody in Iquitos is so excited,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;The Amazon has been hit really hard by the pandemic. So being able to do something good for the region couldn&#8217;t have happened at a better time.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="78923e2e807270462612537c99f2d103"><name>community-achivist</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Rebecca Hernandez to serve as campus's first community archivist</title><summary>Rebecca Hernandez, who previous served as the director of the American Indian Resource Center, will seek out partnerships with community organizations and leaders to support the preservation of community history, with a particular focus on reaching out to traditionally underrepresented communities.</summary><start-date>1642665600000</start-date><display-name>Community archivist</display-name><path>/2022/01/community-achivist</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/01/community-achivist</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1642700357148</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1642713105279</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/01/images/rebecca-hernandez-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/01/images/rebecca-hernandez-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rebecca-hernandez-500px.jpg</name><display-name>rebecca-hernandez-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>192622</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Rebecca Hernandez</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/01/images/rebecca-hernandez-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/01/images/rebecca-hernandez-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rebecca-hernandez-80px.jpg</name><display-name>rebecca-hernandez-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>15577</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Rebecca Hernandez</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Rebecca Hernandez&#160;will partner with the campus and community to develop and facilitate public history projects using a variety of methodologies including oral histories and exhibitions.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Rebecca Hernandez, the former director of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s American Indian Resource Center (AIRC), is now the university&#8217;s first community archivist.</p>
<p>In this new role, which re-envisions the university&#8217;s Regional History Project, Hernandez will focus on ensuring a broad representation of the history of Santa Cruz County. She is charged with seeking out partnerships with community organizations and leaders to support the preservation of community history, with a particular focus on reaching out to traditionally underrepresented communities. She will partner with the campus and community to develop and facilitate public history projects using a variety of methodologies including oral histories and exhibitions.</p>
<p>In announcing the new program, university librarian Elizabeth Cowell said that she considered it a particularly important venture which would &#8220;lead to the increased diversity of our collections and deepen our engagement with the campus and Santa Cruz County by offering tools and methodologies to collect stories and histories from all community members.&#8221;</p>
<p>Head of Special Collections &amp; Archives, Teresa Mora, cited the success of such community-led endeavors as Watsonville is in the Heart. The community-led project is working in collaboration with UCSC students and faculty to document and promote the long-standing history of the Filipino community in Watsonville. She is eager to further similar partnerships providing opportunities for student engagement as well as community documentation.</p>
<p>The library conducted a nationwide search for the new position, and Mora stressed Hernandez&#8217;s track record in building relationships within the campus and community as what singled her out as a candidate. Mora noted Hernandez&#8217;s work with the AIRC, calling it &#8220;extraordinary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She showed what could be done by establishing strong relationships on campus with faculty and staff and engaging with the student population,&#8221; Mora said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to see Rebecca&#8217;s vision for this new program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hernandez directed the AIRC for seven years starting in 2014, where she advocated for Native students and worked to connect with the larger university community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together with the team, I developed relationships with faculty and staff to partner with the center on projects and events,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The programming hosted by the AIRC garnered national attention. Working with students and the resource center staff allowed me to grow and change&#8212;professionally and personally. I&#8217;ll always be grateful for the years I spent in that unit. Now I&#8217;m beginning a new chapter, one that allows me to bring what I&#8217;ve learned to the work I&#8217;ll be doing as the community archivist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hernandez already has numerous ties to the community. She serves as vice president of the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History board, is a member of the Latino Affairs Commission, and Rise Together, a program of the Santa Cruz Community Foundation working to advance racial equity in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>Hernandez has been interested in archives since her days as a graduate student. Her dissertation examines collecting practices and the inherent complexities in the public representation of cultures - including how the describing and defining of Native American objects aids in the construction of Amerindian identity.</p>
<p>Since earning her MA in American Indian Studies at UCLA and Ph.D. from the University of New Mexico, she has become even more passionate about how people and communities are represented in large institutions, especially in collections. She is looking forward to working in the library where she can engage her scholarly work in new ways, and help amplify community voices. She hopes her new post will allow her to encourage more students to become librarians and archivists and help their communities celebrate their histories.</p>
<p>The concept of community archives is a relatively recent phenomenon. Community archives and other community-centric history, heritage, and memory projects work to empower communities to tell, protect, and share their history on their terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to working with my new colleagues to shape the community archives here at UCSC and to building lasting connections both on and off campus through our efforts,&#8221; Hernandez said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="789ebad4807270462612537c02610f91"><name>surge-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>National Endowment for the Arts award to support 'Surge,' an afrofuturism festival</title><summary>Events will take place throughout the academic year, culminating in a month-long festival in May 2022 with live music concerts and dance performances.</summary><start-date>1642665600000</start-date><display-name>Afrofuturism festival</display-name><path>/2022/01/surge-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/01/surge-grant</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1642701175489</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1642707634866</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Music</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/01/images/surge-afrofuturism-festival-promo-image.png</path><link>site://news/2022/01/images/surge-afrofuturism-festival-promo-image.png</link><site>news</site><name>surge-afrofuturism-festival-promo-image.png</name><display-name>surge-afrofuturism-festival-promo-image.png</display-name><file-size>3934637</file-size><width>2400</width><height>1600</height></image><image-alt>Photo collage featuring Hesterian Musicism, tinypistol, and Pamela Z</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/01/images/afrofuturism-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/01/images/afrofuturism-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>afrofuturism-80px.jpg</name><display-name>afrofuturism-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>15382</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Pamela Z at a computer</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Hesterian Musicism (top), tinypistol (left), and Pamela Z (right).</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Afrofuturism is an aesthetic and philosophical framework at the intersections of the arts, science and technology, intent on imagining and creating a world where African-descended peoples and cultures can live and flourish</article-subhead><article-text><p>The National Endowment of the Arts has awarded UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences a grant of $50,000 for &#8220;Surge,&#8221; an event series on the theme of Afrofuturism organized by Professors Karlton Hester and Gerald Casel, Department of Performance, Play &amp; Design, in collaboration with Aaron Samuel Mulenga, PhD student, Visual Studies. Events for &#8220;Surge&#8221; take place throughout the current academic year, culminating in a month-long festival in May 2022 with live music concerts and dance performances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surge&#8221; is among 1,248 projects across the United States totaling more than $28.8 million selected to receive this first round of fiscal year 2022 funding in the Grants for Arts Projects category.</p>
<p>Afrofuturism is an aesthetic and philosophical framework at the intersections of the arts, science and technology, intent on imagining and creating a world where African-descended peoples and cultures can live and flourish.</p>
<p>For the organizers of &#8220;Surge,&#8221; afrofuturism, and the rich history of Black culture it emerges from, has never been more important.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Covid has rampaged through communities,&#8221; Hester said, &#8220;there is another kind of &#8216;surge&#8217; taking place in society to which our programming responds. People are increasingly focused on how to heal, transform society and promote racial justice. By organizing a festival drawing on global Afrofuturist traditions of cultural resistance (and resilience), as conceptualized in the 1950s by cosmic philosopher and jazz giant Sun Ra, we aim to highlight how this intellectual and creative genealogy can help us build a better, post pandemic future for Black people and for all people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The importance of dance, music and the arts broadly are often overlooked when considering what is necessary to advance social transformation,&#8221; said Casel. &#8220;We are grateful for the National Endowment for the Arts for recognizing the importance of culture &#8211; and particularly for supporting a project which highlights the work of musicians, artists and choreographers of color. The arts have certainly not been immune from racial inequalities, and that makes it all the more exciting to have the opportunity to create this programming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Online events have already begun for &#8220;Surge,&#8221; with Aaron Samual Mulenga, a graduate student in Visual Studies and researcher at the Institute of the Arts and Sciences, hosting a series of online conversations with artists and performers from African and its diasporas. Additional discussions, film screenings and events will take place online and in person in the lead-up to the concerts and dance performances taking place every weekend in May.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are honored that this vital and collaborative arts initiative is supported by the National Endowment for the Arts,&#8221; said Institute of the Arts and Sciences director Rachel Nelson. &#8220;Working with our faculty and graduate students to create arts programming which engages critical social issues is our main goal at the Institute, and I am thrilled for the opportunity to bring these experiences to our students and the public.&#8221;</p>

<li>February is Black History Month</li>
<li>Happy Lunar New Year, Slugs!</li>
<li>Commencement plans in place</li>
<li>Alumni Week to include virtual and in-person events</li>

<h2>Commemorating Black History Month</h2>
<p>February is Black History Month. It is both a celebration of excellence and an opportunity to amplify community voices. I hope that you will take part in the campus happenings planned for the month and beyond, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our African American Theater Arts Troupe, now in its 31st year, will present <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/da-kink-my-hair-trey-anthony&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642795772349000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3OekAjeAO4TrdOrZDxm_d4" href="https://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/da-kink-my-hair-trey-anthony" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seven performances of &#8220;Da Kink in My Hair.&#8221;</a> The shows, with in-person audiences, will be performed on the UCSC Theater Arts Center Mainstage.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll see a host of stories on our newscenter next month celebrating Black excellence in our community. Among them is a profile of Professor Karlton Hester, a jazz musician, director of jazz studies in our Music Department, and director of our Digital Arts and New Media program. He also was recently appointed our Art Division&#8217;s first-ever Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Congratulations, Karlton!</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thrilled to announce that Ruha Benjamin will be our Martin Luther King Jr. Convocation speaker on Feb. 23! She is a sociologist and professor in Princeton University&#8217;s Department of African American Studies whose work focuses on the relationship between innovation and equity, particularly at the intersection of race, justice and technology. More details will be posted soon on our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/events/mlk&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642795772349000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2SKxMvZF6d79VCeo1BhZep" href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/events/mlk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">convocation website</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Marking the start of Lunar New Year</h2>
<p>Feb. 1 this year also coincides with the beginning of what China and other East Asian countries call Spring Festival, which is the start of the Lunar New Year. This coming year will be the year of the Tiger. Our Global Engagement team is putting together a list of campus events that celebrate Lunar New Year, with the schedule posted on their special <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://global.ucsc.edu/programming/lny2022/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642795772349000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2z2-OoqO323KKU1WYHr8rw" href="https://global.ucsc.edu/programming/lny2022/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lunar New Year webpage</a>. If you have an event you&#8217;d like listed, email <a href="mailto:globalprogramming@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">globalprogramming@ucsc.edu</a>. In the meantime, I wish all who celebrate the holiday good luck, good health, and good fortune. Happy Lunar New Year, Slugs!</p>
<h2>Commencement plans for Class of 2022 in place!</h2>
<p>Planning is well underway for our Class of 2022 commencement. Many of the details regarding the June 9-12 ceremonies are already posted online, and I encourage anyone with questions to visit our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commencement.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642795772349000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1OF_LUMKbG5AfsECg-iwVH" href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commencement website</a>.</p>
<p>As more students graduate every year, commencement ceremonies have begun to exceed our capacity. To continue to hold commencement on campus (which surveys show is the overwhelming wish of students and the greater campus community) we are keeping the hybrid format that worked so well last year. In short, we are planning the return of Slug Crossing! This stage-crossing opportunity for graduates will be held on campus over a period of several days. We will also hold virtual commencements to ensure Banana Slugs near and far can celebrate this great achievement with family and friends. Each graduate will be able to create a custom slide that will be shown during the online ceremony.</p>
<p>Emails with more details on commencement will go out later this quarter. Email our team at <a href="mailto:commencement@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commencement@ucsc.edu</a> if you have questions in the interim. In the meantime, good luck as we inch closer to this major achievement in your life! It will be here sooner than you think, and I can&#8217;t wait to celebrate with our 2022 graduates!</p>
<h2>Dates set for Alumni Week 2022</h2>
<p>A mix of virtual and in-person events awaits those taking part in Alumni Week 2022, which will run April 19-24. The beginning of the week, Tuesday through Thursday, will feature virtual events, transitioning to more in-person events Friday through Sunday. Watch your inbox for more details or visit the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642795772349000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ioZcATCCvvrbsyRchPd14" href="https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alumni Week website</a>, which will have additional details posted soon.</p>
<h2>Gratitude for your efforts</h2>
<p>Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the many incredible staff and faculty working hard behind the scenes over the past several weeks to keep our operations running. You are dedicated and showing up in an ever-evolving environment, and your efforts should not and do not go unrecognized. In the coming weeks, I hope that all in our SlugStrong community will double down on compassion and caring for one another.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="79a0769d807270462612537c6bc1d777"><name>returning-to-campus</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Returning to campus: testing requirements, COVID call center, booster clinics, and more</title><summary>As we plan to resume in-person instruction January 31, I write to share essential information regarding the processes and protocols for students returning to campus.</summary><start-date>1642579200000</start-date><display-name>Returning to campus: testing requirements, COVID call center, booster clinics, and more</display-name><path>/2022/01/returning-to-campus</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/01/returning-to-campus</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1642718066287</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662581623739</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As we plan to resume in-person instruction January 31, I write to share essential information regarding the processes and protocols for students returning to campus.

Accordingly, we strongly recommend that you upgrade your face covering to an N95, KN95, or a surgical mask in combination with a cloth mask when you return to campus.</p>
<p><em>Residential students</em> can pick up one KN95 and two surgical masks at their community housing office during regular business hours (10 a.m. - 4 p.m.).</p>
<p><em>Non-residential students</em> can pick up a KN95 or surgical mask at the Bay Tree Bookstore while supplies last.</p>
<p>We continue to make efforts to secure additional KN95 masks for the campus community.</p>
<h2>Get Your Booster</h2>
<p>Obtain a booster shot as soon as you can.

<p>Partch&#8217;s transformative work has shed light on the protein-based signaling mechanisms and structural assemblies that give rise to daily cycles known as circadian rhythms in most living things. These daily cycles affect virtually every aspect of our physiology and are driven by the interactions of clock proteins in our cells.</p>
<p>Partch&#8217;s studies reveal protein dynamics and interactions at the core of molecular circadian timing mechanisms in both mammals and in cyanobacteria. Her unique approach to the field combining biochemistry, molecular biophysics, and structural biology has provided a deeper mechanistic understanding of how these clocks function at the molecular level.</p>
<p>The NAS Award in Molecular Biology is presented with a medal and a $25,000 prize.</p>
<p>Partch is among 18 individuals being honored this year with NAS awards recognizing their extraordinary scientific achievements in a wide range of fields spanning the physical, biological, social, and medical sciences. The winners will be honored in a ceremony during the National Academy of Sciences' 159th annual meeting in April.</p>
<p>The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit institution that was established under a congressional charter signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. It recognizes achievement in science by election to membership, and&#8212;with the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Medicine&#8212;provides science, engineering, and health policy advice to the federal government and other organizations.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/circadian-clock.html</url><title>Scientists assemble a biological clock in a test tube to study how it works</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/clock-mutations.html</url><title>Molecular switch mechanism explains how mutations shorten biological clocks</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/night-owls.html</url><title>Scientists discover how a common mutation leads to ‘night owl’ sleep disorder</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7f0c77c7807270462612537cfb1481ce"><name>picnic-tables</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Ten new picnic tables customed designed, handcrafted, and installed on campus</title><summary>It was a rush order, no question about it.

deliveries</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a rush order, no question about it.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In early September, Chancellor Cynthia Larive asked Physical Plant, Development and Operations to install 10 picnic tables on the main residential campus by the opening of fall quarter so students would have more outdoor social and study space. The campus has long had outdoor tables and benches in various locations but many&#8212;made from redwood and more than 50 years old&#8212;had deteriorated from age and weather. These new tables needed to be sturdy and attractive, and the chancellor offered criteria for where they should go.&#160;&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff got to work. One task force formed to select suitable locations while others started searching for appropriate high-quality tables in kits that could be shipped in a reasonable time frame. But after an exhaustive search&#8212;hundreds of leads were explored&#8212; it became clear that wasn&#8217;t going to happen. Either quality tables weren&#8217;t available or the cost was prohibitive.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So the PPDO team decided they&#8217;d DIY. The project involved buyers, financial affairs staff, and members of the Structural Trades and Crafts Shop, better known as the campus Carpentry Shop. When students, staff, and faculty return to on-campus instruction at the end of the month, they&#8217;ll find 10 solid timber-frame tables at popular gathering spots.</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s the most rewarding project I&#8217;ve done up here,&#8221; said carpenter Randy Denham.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Denham and fellow carpenter Zack Mitchell created a template based on original tables built in the 1960s and added a longer end, making it accessible for wheelchair users. They also added a little more space between bench and table.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It took a lot of effort, a lot of conversations,'' added Dave Jessen, Structural Trades superintendent. &#8220;It&#8217;s a tribute to the experience that a lot of these folks have.&#8221; He credited administrative support for helping ensure the project came together quickly. &#8220;When we came up with this design and then the material lists, we had to order all the hardware; they turned that around so fast.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chancellor Larive said she&#8217;s delighted with the outcome. &#8220;We&#8217;re lucky to have an extremely talented team in our carpentry shop. I&#8217;m also thrilled they were able to use the table design from back in our founding days. Our carpenters turned a supply-chain problem into a great opportunity that highlighted their skill and the teamwork of PPDO.&#8221;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole campus community benefits, she added. &#8220;We have such a beautiful campus. Tables like these help facilitate our engagement with the environment and with each other.&#8221;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessen said he and the carpenters originally wanted to use redwood but second- and third-growth redwood doesn&#8217;t hold up as well and it would take too long to find reclaimed old-growth timber.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with a Felton lumber yard, buyers procured western red cedar from the Pacific Northwest. Necessary hardware was located, purchased, and delivered in record time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Painters oiled the finished tables and benches. The sign shop created inscriptions for each table. Each table will also bear a bronze plaque made from reclaimed material and cast by sculpture instructor Sean Monaghan. The plaques have been picked up and will be installed in the next few weeks.<br/></span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was fun working with such nice material,&#8221; Mitchell said of the cedar. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to find a bench of this &#8220;A&#8221; quality&#8212;big beefy timber that fits the decor of the campus. It&#8217;s a good job if you&#8217;re a builder and you enjoy building. It is a rewarding job.&#8221;&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;d like to build more,&#8221; Dehnam said.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The tables each weigh about 500 pounds and were placed starting in mid-October as they were finished. Campus movers were booked solid for several weeks so the structural trades group borrowed a flatbed delivery truck from Shop Stores. It required four people and the truck&#8217;s liftgate to get the tables to their final locations.</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newly built tables can be found in pairs at Quarry Plaza, Science Hill, Digital Arts Resource Center, Humanities, and Classroom Units.&#160;</span></p>

They are Suzanne Alonzo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and James Zachos, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences.</p>
<p>Alonzo was recognized &#8220;for distinguished contributions to the field of ecology and evolution, particularly for field and modeling approaches to understanding the evolution of reproductive behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alonzo uses a combination of mathematical theory, field research, and lab experiments to understand the evolution and ecology of reproduction and how social interactions among individuals arise and evolve. Her lab mostly studies fish, which are strikingly diverse and exhibit impressive plasticity in their social and reproductive behaviors. Her work provides novel insights into old questions and increases scientists&#8217; ability to explain and predict the diversity of reproductive patterns observed in nature.</p>
<p>Alonzo currently serves as vice president of the American Society of Naturalists and president elect of the International Society of Behavioral Ecology. She is also a visiting fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, Toulouse School of Economics, and editor of the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>. She has received continuous funding from the National Science Foundation throughout her career, including the prestigious Early CAREER Award.</p>
<p>Zachos, who holds the Ida Benson Lynn Chair of Ocean Health at UCSC, was recognized for &#8220;outstanding contributions in geology, paleontology, and climate science of the Cenozoic and Cretaceous oceans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zachos studies the climates and marine environments of Earth's distant past by analyzing evidence in the layers of sediments deposited on the seafloor. Much of his research has focused on major climate shifts during the past 65 million years, such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). This work is highly relevant to understanding how human activities are driving modern-day global climate change. In a study published in <em>Science</em> in 2020, Zachos and other climate scientists compiled for the first time a continuous, high-fidelity record of variations in Earth&#8217;s climate extending 66 million years into the past.</p>
<p>A member of the National Academy of Sciences, Zachos is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Geophysical Union, California Academy of Sciences, and Geological Society of America. He received the 2016 Milutin Milankovic Medal from the European Geosciences Union.</p>
<p>Election as a AAAS Fellow is an honor bestowed upon AAAS members by their peers. This year, 564 members have been awarded this honor by AAAS because of their scientifically or socially distinguished efforts to advance science or its applications.</p>
<p>The new Fellows will be celebrated later this year during an in-person gathering when it is feasible from a public health and safety perspective. The new class will also be featured in the AAAS News &amp; Notes section of <em>Science</em> in January 2022.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8db3edce807270462612537c2c8729c8"><name>covid-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>On-campus testing, masks, booster clinics, proof of vaccination</title><summary>Here are the latest COVID-19 mitigation updates to help us prepare for a more populated campus during the winter quarter.&#13;

<h2>Reminder: On-Campus Testing Availability</h2>
<p>Weekday testing is available Monday through Friday at the Merrill Cultural Center with appointments <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://backtoschool.fulgentgenetics.com/ucsantacruz/residence_appointment/screen/landing&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643140623625000&amp;usg=AOvVaw00GeQ-TGrdzJrFhwtS_PDk" href="https://backtoschool.fulgentgenetics.com/ucsantacruz/residence_appointment/screen/landing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scheduled through Fulgent</a>. As Chancellor Larive mentioned in her <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/01/campus-update-january.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643140623625000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1tIwBLFedSretAkjTXm9s8" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/01/campus-update-january.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent message</a>, we are in the process of expanding our testing capacity through a partnership with UCLA to provide saliva-based testing. Below we&#8217;ve also included the latest testing information if you are about to return to on-site work.</p>
<h2>On-Site Work: Testing Requirements</h2>
<p><strong>24 Hours Before You Arrive</strong></p>
<p><em>Employees who are not fully vaccinated</em> are required to get tested or take a self-administered COVID-19 test 24 hours prior to returning to on-site work.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that <em>fully vaccinated employees</em> get tested or take a self-administered COVID-19 test at least 24 hours before returning to on-site work.</p>
<p><strong>For <em>all employees,</em> if your test is positive, please postpone your return until your healthcare provider has cleared you. If you have been exposed through close contact, please contact your manager and follow current <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-on-Isolation-and-Quarantine-for-COVID-19-Contact-Tracing.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643140623625000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1d0s7RXlfG12PjUF7wTV5M" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-on-Isolation-and-Quarantine-for-COVID-19-Contact-Tracing.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CDPH Guidelines</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Returning to On-Site Work</strong></p>
<p>Employees who are <em>not fully vaccinated</em> are required to test at an on-campus testing site within 48 hours of their return to on-site work. After your initial on-site test, you will need to resume the testing cadence of at least once every 4 days.</p>
<p><em>Please Note:</em> The 4-day testing requirement does not apply to employees who have completed a COVID-19 vaccine series but are not yet eligible for their booster or who will receive their booster by Jan. 31.</p>
<p><em>Fully vaccinated employees</em> are advised to take an on-site Fulgent PCR test when they return to campus, but it is not required.</p>
<p><strong>Regardless of vaccination status, all employees</strong> will also need to complete the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643140623625000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GrqZGbQzQ-Y7-7AkDXkf_" href="https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">daily symptom checker</a> once they return to on-site work.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, we recommend that all employees</strong> self-monitor for any COVID-like symptoms within 7 days of their return as a best practice. Please notify your medical provider as appropriate.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/winter_break_protocol.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643140623625000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0vfT_7uwQtWe5IxAgXlqVD" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/winter_break_protocol.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UC Santa Cruz Winter Quarter Return Protocol</a> for more about testing requirements based on your vaccination status.</p>
<h2>Upgrade Your Face Covering</h2>
<p>Due to the infectious nature of the Omicron variant, we strongly recommend that UCSC employees upgrade their face coverings to an N95 respirator, KN95 mask, or a disposable surgical mask in combination with a cloth mask while working on campus.</p>
<p>A list of face coverings available from the campus and the request form are on the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643140623625000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1dD5lg851X_zzxvWfxqYQI" href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Environmental Health &amp; Safety website.</a> Please attempt to consolidate requests into a single submission by department, research group, or building as appropriate. Masks are also being distributed at the Merrill Cultural Center, Bay Tree Bookstore, McHenry Library, S&amp;E Library, and Kerr Hall.</p>
<h2>Booster Clinics: Jan. 26-28</h2>
<p>If you couldn&#8217;t attend one of our booster clinics this past week, the good news is that we have more clinics scheduled in the next several days.</p>
<p><strong>The Student Health Center will host additional booster clinics on Jan. 26-28 at the Stevenson Event Center.</strong> For those dates, you can make an appointment for a Moderna booster through <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643140623625000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1tlwq9FJvzEiV0Z1wSYsYV" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Health e-Messenger.</a></p>
<p>If none of the clinic dates or locations work for you, you can find locations administering free COVID-19 boosters by visiting California&#8217;s <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://myturn.ca.gov/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643140623625000&amp;usg=AOvVaw19b_L_EikpzNmqr06-qj5e" href="https://myturn.ca.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MyTurn website</a>.</p>

The DRC has implemented a new workflow platform, Accommodate, which is driving these updates. We have received some comments and concerns from faculty regarding the new layout of the Academic Access (AA) Letters that are generated in the new system. There have been a few changes in the format that we want to share with you today.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We encourage you to review this </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ka_deH4w5miONPfpVztQIRGQ7vrHbgo9/view&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643212594932000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2BvcL2K82J-M9oZKwdeU3k" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ka_deH4w5miONPfpVztQIRGQ7vrHbgo9/view" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>sample letter</span></a><span> demonstrating the new format. The most significant update in the letter template is that the course and related instructor will no longer show on the top of the letter. All of the courses that a student is actively using an accommodation for will populate below the description of the accommodation.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Please note that there will be some variability in the letters that you receive due to the phased roll out of Accommodate. A few letters were generated using our old process so those letters will look the same as letters generated prior to winter 2022. A few letters were generated for students that did not tie their accommodations to a particular course so those will only list each of the accommodations but not include the courses. Finally, the rest of the letters have been/will be generated using the full process and will look similar to </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ka_deH4w5miONPfpVztQIRGQ7vrHbgo9/view&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643212594932000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2BvcL2K82J-M9oZKwdeU3k" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ka_deH4w5miONPfpVztQIRGQ7vrHbgo9/view" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>this letter</span></a><span>.

<p dir="ltr"><span>The DRC will be launching a faculty interface within Accommodate at the start of the spring quarter. The faculty platform will create greater efficiency with regards to viewing the AA letters and students with accommodations in each of your courses.

Today, I am pleased to share that there are additional forms of support available through our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ches.ucsc.edu/back-up-care/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643212594924000&amp;usg=AOvVaw05netCtiQv60DzthVukA-F" href="https://ches.ucsc.edu/back-up-care/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">partnership with Bright Horizons</a> .</p>
<h2>Out-of-network support now available</h2>
<p>Employees and students can now use the out-of-network support option when Bright Horizons is unable to fulfill their request for back-up care through the Bright Horizons network. This means that students and employees can use their existing care network&#8212;such as babysitters, relatives, friends, and other care providers&#8212;and Bright Horizons will reimburse employees and students up to $100 per day for care that they arrange on their own. This option is only available if Bright Horizons cannot provide care during the day and time requested.</p>
<h2>Virtual tutoring</h2>
<p>Students and employees can now schedule time with an experienced tutor to help their 5 to 18-year-old children with their academics. The tutoring includes help with reading, math, science, social studies, and more than 300 other subjects. Students and employees will receive 4 hours of virtual tutoring for each back-up care use. After registering with Bright Horizons, you can submit a tutoring request through the back-up care site and then schedule the days and times that work best for your family.</p>
<h2>Virtual camps</h2>
<p>Students and employees can also enroll their 3 to 12-year-old children in virtual camps that are offered through Bright Horizons by <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://steveandkatescamp.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643212594924000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ii4X0rgPnq1Pylol4fzOt" href="https://steveandkatescamp.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steve &amp; Kate&#8217;s Camp</a> . The program offers a wide range of online classes and clubs in an easy-to-use platform. Activities include crafts, Roblox, fitness, Minecraft, digital art, space exploration, mathletes, acting games, and more.</p>
<h2>More about back-up care benefits</h2>
<p>Each eligible employee and student who registers for the program will be allotted 15 uses per year. Employees and students will be responsible for a copay per use, and campus will cover the rest of the cost. The copay per use for employees will be $10 per child, or $15 per family, for center-based back-up care, and $4 per hour for in-home care (for up to 10 hours/day for up to three children). The copay per use for students will be $5 per child, or $10 per family, for center-based back-up care and $2 per hour for in-home care.</p>
<p>To access the support and programs offered by Bright Horizons, students and employees <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ches.ucsc.edu/back-up-care/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643212594924000&amp;usg=AOvVaw05netCtiQv60DzthVukA-F" href="https://ches.ucsc.edu/back-up-care/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">must register online</a>. I encourage those in our community who are raising children or providing adult care to learn more about these helpful benefits and to register well before you are in need of back-up care.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Lori Kletzer,  Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="932e277f8072704671ace41719691053"><name>voting-rights-civil-rights</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>The struggle to protect voting rights must go on.

Lewis College</a> at the University of California, Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past week, the world watched as Republicans in the Senate blocked </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/us/politics/senate-voting-rights-filibuster.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two key pieces of legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intended to restore voting rights protections that civil rights activists of the 1950s and 1960s dedicated their lives to achieving. To some of us who were participants in and witnesses to those foundational struggles of the Civil Rights Movement, it seems we may now be living through another dangerous time in U.S. history. And a new generation is being called to stand up for their rights and their future. I know this may feel frustrating, discouraging, and disconcerting for today&#8217;s young people. It felt that way at times for my generation, too.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was a college student in 1965 when I participated in efforts to register Black voters in Montgomery, Alabama, with the organization </span><a href="https://snccdigital.org/inside-sncc/sncc-national-office/friends-of-sncc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We faced constant threats of violence from police and white supremacists. This was right after &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloody Sun</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">day</span><a href="https://theconversation.com/how-the-images-of-john-lewis-being-beaten-during-bloody-sunday-went-viral-143080"><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; the pivotal 1965 Selma to Montgomery march for voting rights, during which John Lewis and many other civil rights activists had been brutally beaten at the Edmund Pettus Bridge.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those acts of violence&#8212;and many, many others&#8212;were enabled by what can only be called local state-level totalitarian environments of entwined legal, political, social, economic, and cultural support for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acts of terrorism</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that aimed to intimidate, dissuade, and demoralize civil rights activists. It would take &#8220;a thousand years&#8221; to bring real pro-democracy change, proclaimed some supporters of segregation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, as I witnessed, those in the movement did not give up; and it did not take &#8220;a thousand years&#8221; for the dismantling of legal segregation to be accomplished. In part, I suggest, we did not give up because we did not try to act on the basis of predicting the future. We did not know what would actually work, or how long it would take to change that totalitarian environment. But we did know the importance of doing the right thing. The key word in that phrase is the verb &#8220;doing.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cynics and pessimists proclaim the world to be impervious to genuine positive human development. But those who &#8220;do,&#8221;&#8212;the activists&#8212;know and experience the amazing reality that change is brought into existence when you act to make it happen, even in a small way. Thousands of people doing hundreds of thousands of positive, cooperative actions can create constructive consequences that are unimaginable in the moment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Civil Rights Movement actualized itself through non-violence and compassion in the midst of heavy, negative, repressive, and dangerous powers that seemed to have the upper hand&#8212;until they didn't, often in unpredictable ways.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 6, 1965, after years of struggle and courage on the part of civil rights activists, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act of 1965</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was passed. That historic piece of legislation prohibited racial discrimination in voting by combatting state-level dissenfranchisement practices, securing the right to vote for Black Americans across the country.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This and other successes of the Civil Rights Movement were pivotal in propelling and supporting equally successful actions by other inclusionary movements. Today there are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more women</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all races and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more people of color</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in elected and appointed positions than ever could have been imagined in 1965. The election of Barack Obama as president was a key visible peak of this deep and wide change.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s important to recall those successes, and how they were accomplished, as we face the present moment. From the Supreme Court's 2013 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gutting of key provisions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 1965 Voting Rights Act to the recent deluge of restrictive, anti-democracy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">curtailments of voting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in numerous states, earlier progress is being rolled back, literally &#8220;with a vengeance.&#8221; And in a clear refusal to address these issues, Senate Republicans have voted against the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now is the time for each of us to act on behalf of democracy. Volunteer with a voter registration campaign. Donate and vote in support of political leaders who are fighting voter suppression. Join an advocacy group to push for a more equitable future. Whatever you do best, do it in support of democracy. And do it because it&#8217;s the right thing to do. Together, we will weave an interlocking web of pro-democracy resilience across this country.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s the task that lies ahead. And a new generation of civil rights activists is rising to it. For those who are much younger than I&#8212;please know that you now stand poised on the pro-democracy path. This path has had, over several hundred years, many twists and turns, ups and downs, and it will have many more. But it stretches before you. Awaken to the call of democracy. Do whatever positive action you can, where you are. Defend the work of those gone by. Protect your future and that of coming generations.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="938a14508072704671ace417c3ee4ae0"><name>student-booster-clinics</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title> Booster shots available this week: on-campus clinics Jan. 26-28</title><summary>To help provide students, staff, and faculty access to booster shots, Student Health Services will be administering Moderna boosters Jan 26, 27, and 28 at Stevenson Event Center. </summary><start-date>1643097600000</start-date><display-name> Booster shots available this week: on-campus clinics Jan. 26-28</display-name><path>/2022/01/student-booster-clinics</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/01/student-booster-clinics</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1643152806962</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1643152806962</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The January 31 deadline for all eligible campus community members to receive their COVID-19 booster shot is quickly approaching.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This 2-unit class introduces students to current trends in audio production, including lessons on sound gathering, interviewing scriptwriting, audio editing, and developing a ''radio voice,&#8221; and culminates in the production of a podcast. Students' podcasts can be based on any research project or subject that they want. In addition, the course fulfills the Creative Process (PR-C) general education requirement for UC Santa Cruz students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nada Mijkovic, the Crown lecturer and entrepreneur who originally developed the class and recruited Silva, said, &#8220;I am thrilled to see Nikki teach this class. In 2008, she was my first instructor in audio storytelling as part of the UCSC Social Documentary Masters Program. Many of my sources for the curriculum came from that class. It has gone full circle by going back to the source with Nikki taking over the class.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Porter College alumna, over the past twenty years, Silva has worked as history curator at the Museum of Art and History and as a freelance curator and exhibit consultant specializing in regional history. Having taught courses in documentary and creative radio production at The Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley and for the UC Santa Cruz Social Documentation Program, Silva now brings her years of experience back to UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silva&#8217;s the Kitchen Sisters received the 2019 J. Franklin Jameson Archival Advocacy Award from The Society of American Archivists and a lifetime achievement award from the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University. And most recently, the Library of Congress has acquired the entire archive of The Kitchen Sisters &#8212; some 7,000 hours of interviews, oral histories, and field recordings along with photographs, notebooks, and journals &#8212; and will house and preserve it in perpetuity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re ecstatic that Nikki will teach this summer, especially because the course is being offered online and is accessible to so many students,&#8221; said Monica Parikh, Director of Summer Session. &#8220;Over the summer, the unique offerings from our colleges are open to everyone.&#8221;&#160; Manel Camps, Provost of Crown, the college sponsoring the class, said, &#8220;I love the fact that Nikki is an alumna, that she is local, and that she is willing to share her amazing professional expertise; building bridges between academia and the community to the benefit of our students is that colleges are all about&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the summer, anyone can take classes at UC Santa Cruz. Newly admitted and visiting students must register to enroll.

We are closely following campus and county COVID-19 data, as we have for nearly two years, and the latest wave of infections appears to be declining, as health officials had forecast. Both campus <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/reporting-covid/covid-tracking/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643320244458000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2XSC2uu9FSAR2o4eyN_Crd" href="https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/reporting-covid/covid-tracking/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">case and test-positivity rates</a> are now in decline, and for that we are extremely grateful.</p>
<p>We are also pleased to see strong compliance with the COVID-19 testing protocols we have in place and with the UC system&#8217;s vaccine-booster requirements announced last month. We have run nearly 15,300 tests since the start of the quarter, and nearly 97 percent of our students and roughly 96 percent of our employees are now vaccinated. Our COVID booster rates are also strong, with more than 61 percent of our students who are eligible for boosters having received one, and about 75 percent of employees. Both figures are above county (59 percent), state (37 percent) and national (36 percent) rates, though we want to push our percentages even higher since research shows that a booster helps to both reduce the frequency and severity of COVID infection, especially with the Omicron variant. Our Student Health Center is running a booster clinic open to everyone in our campus community Jan. 26-28 to help students and employees eligible for a booster shoot meet the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/winter_break_protocol.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643320244458000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3dOTFeKddrLrPzfQLbqY0F" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/winter_break_protocol.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jan. 31 compliance deadline</a>. <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643320244458000&amp;usg=AOvVaw35Fye98hGxvN6iBNidG5pW" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sign up for an appointment now</a>! Drop-ins are also allowed at the clinic until 4 p.m. today, 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday, and 8:30-11 a.m. Friday. We offer our gratitude to all Banana Slugs who are doing their part to support the well-being of our campus community.</p>
<p>We know that new cases will continue to occur as we transition to the endemic stage of COVID. Some in our community continue to recover from illness or may need to isolate or quarantine in the coming weeks and months because of infection or exposure. Many of you face extra caregiving responsibilities due to COVID. We aim to be flexible in all of these instances. We understand that these are challenging, unpredictable times, and we remain committed to supporting all in our campus community.</p>
<h2>Returning to campus</h2>
<p>The majority of our courses will switch to in-person instruction on Monday, Jan. 31, while some classes may continue to be offered remotely. Academic leaders are finalizing the course schedule and instructors may seek to continue to teach remotely due to COVID-related circumstances that make in-person instruction infeasible. Instructors will be in touch with their students before classes resume to inform them if their plans for the quarter have changed.</p>
<p>Staff who have been working remotely and plan to return to in-person work should be in contact with managers about their plans. Departments are encouraged to continue offering flexible working options, as appropriate for their operational needs.</p>
<p>Our Slug Strong campaign remains the foundation of our plan to repopulate campus and return to mostly in-person instruction. Our plan includes pre- and post-arrival testing, completing the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1643320244458000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0sxtDk-Y2ze5z41Qe-FYE4" href="https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Daily COVID-19 Symptom Check survey</a> if you are coming to a campus location, and strengthening our community&#8217;s resistance to the virus by requiring vaccine booster shots.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Published by Yale University Press, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Fortress In Brooklyn</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> looks into the history and present state of the Hasidic Jewish community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The members of this sect arrived in the U.S. shortly after WWII as Holocaust survivors, settling in a working class New York neighborhood with a determination to hold on to their Orthodox religious practices and isolate themselves from modern influences. Despite the challenges of living in one of the poorest neighborhoods in New York City, their numbers grew exponentially and, more recently, they have struggled to maintain their insular community while also dealing with the skyrocketing cost of living in the city and the impact of intense gentrification.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the book&#8217;s publication last May, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Fortress in Brooklyn </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was praised as &#8220;groundbreaking&#8221; by critic Laura E. Adkins in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">LA Review of Books</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p>The program&#8217;s Tech Development Track provides up to $5,000 in funding for student-led projects that aim to develop a solution to a significant societal challenge. Students are encouraged to form multi-disciplinary teams to develop innovative technology-centered projects, which are then selected through a competitive process.&#160;</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s funded projects and team members are:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Multimodal Virtual Assistant for Farmers</strong></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">This project aims to leverage cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques to build a virtual assistant for farmers. The aim is to provide farmers with instant access to information that would not otherwise be easily accessible or available to them. Much of the valuable agriculture information on the internet seems to be dense, highly technical, and hard to find. Information about specific agricultural questions is relatively sparse compared to the information accessible in other domains. One motivation of this project is to inform farmers about how to make sustainable choices that are not only good for them economically, but also good for the world. The team wants to use state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to create a tool that will bridge the information network gap between the untapped useful information and working farmers.</div>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Global Environmental Justice Observatory (GEJO)</strong></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">The Global Environmental Justice Observatory (GEJO) seeks to explore and improve understandings of the interdisciplinary problems and applications of environmental justice and serve as a resource for students, academics, and the general public. A problem the team has identified within the academic environmental justice community is that much of the research being done has access restrictions. GEJO seeks to address this issue with its open-access website, which features its two main programs: the GEJO podcast (&#8220;Liminal Spaces&#8221;) and the Global Environmental Justice (GEJ) Journal. The GEJ Journal consists of undergraduate student research papers and theses exploring topics related to environmental justice. These papers are reviewed by the student-led editorial board, who work closely with the student researchers to refine their work leading up to publication. The goal of this journal is to present a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to environmental justice than is found in mainstream conversations, as well as to promote high caliber undergraduate student work. Funding will be used to develop the existing program and website as well as to host an art show featuring environmental art created by students, which will also be photographed and highlighted on the website.</div>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>San Quentin COVID Archive: Stories from the Inside</strong></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">The heart of this project is an online community zine featuring original artwork and writing from the currently incarcerated community at California prisons reflecting on their experiences surviving the COVID-19 outbreak. Digital storytelling is a way for incarcerated people to have agency in an environment in which agency is constantly taken from them. This archival project gives them access to the technology and tools they need to share their stories with people outside of prison. Furthermore, the project amplifies their experiences through various digital and print media across social media platforms to increase civic engagement that advocates for policy change. The goal of this project is multifold: to document emergent and unique cultural practices amidst the ever-shifting reality of COVID-19 behind bars, document the organizing that took place in response to COVID, create space for artistic expression and dignified storytelling by those directly impacted, shift public perceptions of incarcerated people, and educate the public on the urgent need for prison decarceration in order to save lives.</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team analyzed 170 climate action plans, developed by cities across California, that offer policy strategies for addressing the impacts of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with state targets. This type of planning has the potential to transform cities, either reducing or worsening social and economic inequalities in the process. And poor communities and communities of color within cities are often most vulnerable to climate change impacts like extreme heat and flooding. The </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0739456X211072527"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set out to determine how cities were incorporating these types of considerations into their planning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While more cities are making stated commitments to equity in their climate action plans now than in the past, the analysis showed that the vast majority still lack meaningful discussion of these issues in substantive policy terms. And policy proposals that could affect equity outcomes are often focused heavily on aesthetically &#8220;green&#8221; policies, like tree-planting, over &#8220;gray&#8221; policies related to buildings and infrastructure that might actually go further to address local issues in many cities. The paper found that both equity language and the specific policy proposals in plans were generally not closely tied to actual inequalities in a given city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These plans are often missing the big picture by focusing on smaller and more superficial interventions that don&#8217;t do as much to address some of the structural problems that we think are producing equity issues related to climate,&#8221; said the study&#8217;s lead author, Associate Professor of Sociology Hillary Angelo.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings may also indicate that ideas and perspectives from the climate justice movement have not yet been incorporated into many city climate plans, Angelo says. Among the plans reviewed in the study, 39% contained no equity language at all. Others mentioned equity without offering policies specifically intended to address it. Researchers used a three-point scale to rate how well-developed equity discussions were within the plans, and only 5% received top scores. Even fewer explicitly mentioned racial inequalities or addressed historical racial injustices.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, components of these plans may still affect equity outcomes, so the research team sorted relevant policy proposals into nine major categories. Among them, open space and trees and recycling and waste management were the two most common and well-developed types of proposals, followed by public transportation and participatory processes. Plans averaged a score of 2.0 or more in these categories on a three-point rating scale that measured how specific, concrete, and locally-tailored policies were.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, there was a substantial drop-off in the proportion of plans that included well-developed proposals to address climate-related health issues, green jobs, access to locally grown food, affordable housing, and denser development within established urban areas. Plans averaged ratings of 0.8 and 0.9 in the latter two categories, respectively, on the same three-point scale.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing, urban density, and other &#8220;gray&#8221; solutions were more likely to be incorporated when plans included strong equity language. But researchers say the overall lack of focus on these issues in most climate action plans is a missed opportunity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Denser urban areas where people can easily walk or take transit to schools, grocery stores, and jobs are the areas where people drive less and have less emissions from transportation,&#8221; explained coauthor Adam Millard-Ball, an associate professor of urban planning at UCLA and a former UCSC faculty member in environmental studies. &#8220;Given that transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in California, it would make sense for cities to build more housing in these types of dense, walkable places, and to plan for housing and emissions reductions together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the research team wasn&#8217;t surprised to see trees and open space take precedence in climate action plans. Urban greening can provide some important climate benefits, like carbon sequestration and shade and cooling to combat extreme heat. But several factors may encourage an overemphasis on these types of solutions relative to local needs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green space and tree-planting efforts enjoy broad bipartisan support, which the paper demonstrated by comparing city voting records with the policies in corresponding climate action plans. Housing policies and equity language, on the other hand, were more likely to be included in more progressive cities, regardless of which cities actually had the highest level of need.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategies like tree-planting are also cheaper and easier to implement than changes to housing and infrastructure, which makes them more appealing to cities struggling with limited resources and expertise. And Angelo says green policies fit with cultural beliefs about sustainability. Her prior book, </span><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo61910401.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Green Became Good: Urbanized Nature and the Making of Cities and Citizens</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, traced how green space projects first gained popularity in large American and European cities in the 19th century, then eventually became considered a universal moral good.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This belief has warped public politics, because aesthetically green projects are so beloved that they often go unquestioned, whether they actually address the needs of a community or not,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;The findings of this new paper demonstrate that in an empirical way.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To overcome this issue, Angelo says communities should focus on &#8220;greening better,&#8221; with more self-awareness about the limitations of what these practices can accomplish. She also recommends greening less, by &#8220;resisting these ideas as a knee-jerk reaction&#8221; to urban problems and thinking more holistically about solutions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the paper&#8217;s authors say city climate action plans across California must do more to center equity moving forward, both in the language that conveys the goals of these plans and in ensuring that specific proposed policies are targeted to tackle the toughest local injustices.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been most surprised by the extent to which the interventions in these plans often have little to do with local needs,&#8221; Angelo said. &#8220;When cities have environmental problems, there are a wide variety of measures that might be needed to address them. Sometimes that might mean more parks, but in other instances, more systemic interventions in the built environment will have bigger ecological and social impacts.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b2cf3ea38072704671ace417b5441a87"><name>hester-karlton-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Hitting a high note</title><summary>Music Professor Karlton Hester, named the first associate dean for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the arts for the Arts Division, believes all ethnicities benefit from inclusion and an increased focus on Black history, Indigenous history, and traditional knowledge.</summary><start-date>1643677200000</start-date><display-name>Hitting a high note</display-name><path>/2022/01/hester-karlton-profile</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/01/hester-karlton-profile</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1643677433487</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1643677433487</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Music</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>black-history</value><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Faculty Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/01/images/hester-karlton.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/01/images/hester-karlton.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hester-karlton.jpg</name><display-name>hester-karlton.jpg</display-name><file-size>247606</file-size><width>500</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt>Music Professor Karlton Hester, recently named the first ever associate dean for diversity</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/01/images/hester-karlton-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/01/images/hester-karlton-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hester-karlton-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>hester-karlton-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>12639</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Music Professor Karlton Hester, recently named the first ever associate dean for diversity</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Music Professor Karlton Hester believes all people of all ethnicities need access to a wider field of knowledge.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music Professor Karlton Hester has mixed feelings about Black History Month. The composer, saxophonist, and flute player believes that it&#8217;s important, but one month is not enough.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There should be a focus on Black history all year, along with women&#8217;s history, Latinx history, and the history of other Indigenous groups, he said. All have been neglected for too long.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The truth is there are many other things happening on the planet outside the colonial perspective&#8212;many important things,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All people of all ethnicities need access to this wider field of knowledge, he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let everyone benefit from diversity, equity, and inclusion,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hester was recently named the first ever associate dean for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the arts for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Arts Division. He said the job is a good fit.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s essentially what I&#8217;ve done all my life anyway,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his research, he has found that the only thing that has historically stood in the way of the development of African American music and culture is the lack of equity, diversity, and inclusion.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When that&#8217;s removed, there&#8217;s a different result,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He points out that jazz operates in a way that&#8217;s democratic. Within African American jazz practice, each musician contributes equally to the creation of musical canvases regardless of their particular instrument.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If 70 percent want something, they get 70 percent of the total resources available to achieve what they want and 30 percent get 30 percent of the total resources available to achieve what they want,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no bullying the minority.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, he said, the colonial perspective is whoever has the biggest guns and is the strongest will get their way.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hester grew up in a music-loving family in El Paso, Texas, where he started playing piano at age 2. He began by imitating the R&amp;B songs he knew from artists like Fats Domino and Little Richard, and by age 4, was taking piano lessons. A few years after that, he was singing in the El Paso Boys' Choir. The choir gave him a rich education in the classical tradition, with instruction in music theory and experiences performing with professional groups, including the symphony, ballet, and orchestra. In 6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grade, he began learning flute and other wind instruments. Outside of school, he took every opportunity to learn from African American music masters.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He says he&#8217;s always loved all types of music.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Music is all interconnected,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everything is interconnected. A note is a note and that&#8217;s all there is to it.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He studied music at the University of Texas and then headed to Southern California, where he got a job as a music educator. Hester earned a doctoral degree in music composition from City University of New York, and taught for a decade at Cornell University. Eventually tiring of the snow that could last October to June, he returned to balmier California to take his position at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hester describes his musical compositions as &#8220;premeditated, spontaneous, and electro-acoustic&#8221; works. He has written a wide variety of styles for woodwinds, chamber groups, music videos, and electro-acoustic symphonic works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I usually tell people to listen to my music if you want to understand me,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adapts his compositions to fit his reactions to environments depending on where he is at the time. When he lived in Seattle, he explained, it felt slow compared to San Francisco, so he created music that was more intense. New York was intense so he created music that was mellow when he lived there, he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At UC Santa Cruz, he serves as director of the Digital Arts and New Media program, which brings all the digital arts together.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, most of the traditional arts have a digital component,&#8221; he explained.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hester has been working with electronic music and sequencing for decades, especially as a way to fill out his compositions when he hasn&#8217;t had access to enough live musicians.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been into multi-layered music,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you don&#8217;t have enough musicians, you still want to hear the sound.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He developed his own style of music he named Hesterian Musicism. He was inspired by masters like John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Duke Ellington, who all came up with their own vocabulary.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I started thinking about my own skills, chords, timbre, and texture, and I did it systematically,&#8221; he said, adding that Hesterian Musicism came out of that research. Hester&#8217;s music is inspired by his spiritual practice, which comes from an &#8220;omniversal&#8221; perspective. He believes that nature is his best teacher and that everything is interconnected.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It means using your surroundings to figure out how things flow,&#8221; he said. One of his recent compositions, named </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantam Elders Consciousness Vaccine,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to &#8220;demonstrate the uninterrupted connection of vibrational consciousness that exists between Earth&#8217;s molecular, spiritual, and intellectual intersections that bind with the Ominverse.&#8221; Hester believes humanity as a whole would benefit if more attention was paid to traditional knowledge, from knowledge of herbs in the rainforest to democratic principles used in powwows. More focus on Black history and Indigenous history means a healthier society for all, he said. </span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b661d03d8072704671ace4172db8e283"><name>covid-reminders</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>COVID-19 reminders, expanded testing options, updated testing protocol, and more</title><summary>As we resume mostly in-person instruction this week, we write to share important reminders and critical updates pertaining to COVID-19.&#13;

<p><strong>Daily Symptom Screening</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not already doing so, please resume your </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html#survey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">daily symptom screenings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when you are coming to campus. These screening surveys support the health and well-being of campus by maintaining awareness of your health on a day-to-day basis. After completing your daily symptom screening, Health e-Messenger will update your </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/badge_protocol.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearance Badge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is important to follow the guidelines and protocols associated with your daily clearance badge, particularly if it is red.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Testing Positive and/or Feeling Unwell</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not feeling well or you test positive for COVID-19, </span><strong>do not attend in-person instruction or engage in any in-person campus activities.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, if you test positive through a campus test, home test, or outside clinic, please isolate per </span><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-on-Isolation-and-Quarantine-for-COVID-19-Contact-Tracing.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDPH guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then, </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/covid_positive_directions_students.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read these guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about what to do next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and have not yet been tested for COVID-19, it is important to get tested. Symptomatic testing can be obtained at Student Health Services during business hours. Please call 831-459-2500 for an appointment. Additionally, residential students may obtain a rapid antigen test kit from their housing office to self test. As you await your test and results, it is important that you follow the </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/covid_positive_directions_students.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">isolation protocol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. During this isolation time, you should not participate in any in-person campus activities except to access health services at the </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Health Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Please note: campus testing kiosks are for asymptomatic people only.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may resume in-person campus activities once your isolation or quarantine period is over.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Updated Testing Protocol</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our asymptomatic testing protocol remains an essential aspect of our COVID-19 mitigation strategy. In conjunction with our return to mostly in-person instruction, we&#8217;ve updated our winter quarter testing protocol. The updated protocol prioritizes more regular testing for residential students given their close proximity to one another and on-campus activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please refer to the </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 Testing Protocol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> web page for a full listing of current testing requirements.&#160;</span></p>

Please schedule an appointment </span><a href="https://backtoschool.fulgentgenetics.com/ucsantacruz/residence_appointment/screen/landing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly through Fulgent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay tuned for more information about our expanding on-campus COVID-19 testing options. We anticipate announcing additional saliva-based testing sites soon!&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Upgraded Face Coverings Available On-Campus</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the highly transmissible nature of the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html?s_cid=11734:covid%20variant%20omicron:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omicron variant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we strongly recommend you upgrade your face covering to an N95, KN95, or a surgical mask in combination with a cloth mask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surgical and KN95 masks are available at a number of campus distribution sites. Distribution is self-service. Please only take what you need. Information about locations and hours of operation for each distribution site can be found on the </span><a href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EH&amp;S COVID-19 Resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Booster Deadline</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Jan. 31, is the deadline for all eligible campus community members to receive and report their COVID-19 booster shot. If you received your booster somewhere other than on campus, please submit proof of your booster via </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/information/health-e-messenger-new.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health e-Messenger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Booster doses given on campus are automatically uploaded to your health record.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not eligible to get your booster by today&#8217;s deadline, your deadline will be automatically extended until two weeks after the date you become eligible.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are excited mostly in-person instruction resumed today, and we recognize this has been a particularly difficult start to our winter quarter. In acknowledging this, we extend our appreciation to each of you. Amidst the many challenges of the past month, we&#8217;ve been deeply humbled by the resiliency you&#8217;ve displayed, the support you&#8217;ve offered, and the community we&#8217;ve become.&#160;</span></p>
