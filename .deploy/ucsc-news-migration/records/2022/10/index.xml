South Asian diaspora.</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new endowed professorship for the UC Santa Cruz </span><a href="https://csas.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for South Asian Studies (CSAS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will advance the center&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">opportunity to elevate a thriving hub for faculty, students, and visiting scholars. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Anuradha Luther Maitra and Thomas Kailath&#8217;s gift will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accelerate and enhance the impact of research while showcasing South Asia&#8217;s contributions and influence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Anuradha Luther Maitra and Thomas Kailath Endowed Professorship in South Asian Studies will be held by a new director of the center&#8212;a recruitment is currently underway to bring a new distinguished scholar of South Asia to campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Center for South Asian Studies&#8212;housed by </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/#slide1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Humanities Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;provides a distinctive interdisciplinary perspective into South Asia by connecting all five academic divisions through a faculty advisory board and affiliated faculty.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz students are citizens of the world,&#8221; said UCSC Dean of Humanities Jasmine Alinder. &#8220;Anu and Thomas&#8217;s generous gift will ensure that the Center for South Asian Studies will contribute to their global perspective. As a region whose geopolitical importance continues to grow each year, South Asia demands our attention, especially through a lens of social and economic justice. This center reflects and builds upon UCSC&#8217;s strengths and core values: social justice, cross-disciplinary thinking, student-centered hands-on courses, real-time problem solving, and the centering of the humanities, arts, and social sciences in understanding and contextualizing history and culture.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center&#8217;s vision is to deepen our scholarly understanding of South Asia and broaden the scope of academic research, social justice, and art at UC Santa Cruz and globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;South Asia, because of its size as well as aspirations and potential for growth, must be seen as linked to the future of our planet. We are hopeful that this gift will spark global interest in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Center for South Asian Studies and will serve as an inflection point for the center&#8217;s trajectory,&#8221; Luther Maitra said. &#8220;The center is an essentially UCSC institution in that its very structure and approach is cross-disciplinary, its focus is social and economic justice. That makes for market differentiation and the promise that it will soon become one of the world&#8217;s leading centers for the study of South Asia and its people (by residence or heritage).&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The endowed professorship will have broad impact. Arriving at a defining moment in CSAS&#8217;s growth, the professorship will support, elevate, and empower the center&#8217;s leadership, advancing the important work and path-breaking research for which the center is already known.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anuradha Luther Maitra is a longtime supporter of UC Santa Cruz, and especially campus initiatives focused on South Asia,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;This gift from Anu and Thomas will allow us to attract the center&#8217;s new leader and seed new and innovative programs, further elevating UCSC&#8217;s profile in the social-justice and economic-equity discourse taking place worldwide.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in fall 2020, the Center for South Asian Studies has been host to numerous speaker series, including the Aurora and Towards Justice lectures, as well as yearlong conversations on histories of dissent and justice, with talks by artists, scholars, and activists from India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CSAS Founding Co-Directors Anjali Arondekar and Dard Neuman said the UC Santa Cruz community can look forward to collaborations and initiatives with organizations within the South Asian diaspora in the Bay Area that share a commitment to a just and democratic South Asia. The community can also look forward to the establishment of a minor in South Asia studies in the coming years, as well as a broader programming platform involving faculty from across divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The professorship will provide much-needed resources to amplify our commitment to justice in South Asia and the broader Indian Ocean world,&#8221; Arondekar said. &#8220;It will allow for the creation of fellowships, research hubs, and teaching resources for the study of South Asia. Most importantly, it will allow UCSC to foreground an interdisciplinary, cross-divisional vision for South Asia that centers histories of struggle, resistance, and democratization.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty from UCSC&#8217;s academic divisions take a distinctive view of the &#8220;Indian subcontinent&#8221; encompassing India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan, the Maldives, and the broader Indian Ocean worlds.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Center researchers work on questions of politics, poverty, education, environment, and health. Viewing these universally important issues through the lens of South Asia allows researchers to arrive at solutions of global importance.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neuman emphasized the decades-long work that has gone into strengthening and supporting the presence of South Asian studies at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This professorship encapsulates nearly twenty years of efforts by faculty, staff, campus leadership, and donors at UCSC to build programs and appoint faculty related to South Asian studies and, most importantly, it will spark new interest and investments from others,&#8221; Neuman said. &#8220;For example, Anu Luther Maitra and Sidhartha Maitra, Kamil and Talat Hasan, Kiran and Arjun Malhotra, and Hardit and Harbhajan K. Singh provided guidance, drive, and leadership, as well as multiple gifts, including two previous endowed chairs in Classical Indian Music and Sikh Studies. Professors Nirvikar Singh and Anjali Arondekar provided the leadership and vision to galvanize multiple efforts across campus into a Center for South Asian Studies. With this gift, we now have the sustainable foundation to continue our new and innovative center into an established global presence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a record of groundbreaking research and education, and a commitment to social and economic justice, the center shapes the cutting edge of the field. The Anuradha Luther Maitra and Thomas Kailath Endowed Professorship in South Asian Studies</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will help the university attract a new leader who will help position CSAS as a leader in global socio-economic discourse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am very excited for this opportunity for the Center for South Asian Studies to expand its reach on a global scale,&#8221; Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer said. &#8220;The critical cross-divisional work and dialogue already taking place at the center is indicative of its renowned faculty, and will be bolstered by Anu and Thomas&#8217;s gift.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luther Maitra praised campus leadership for their commitment to CSAS, and says she and Kailath were inspired to acknowledge this commitment with their impactful gift.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There was a very important commitment made by the Chancellor, the Campus Provost, and the three deans [arts, humanities, and social sciences] in granting and moving forward on a new faculty position devoted to South Asian studies. This was a very important gesture from the leadership of UC Santa Cruz that Thomas and I felt we&#8212;and the community&#8212;should honor,&#8221; Luther Maitra said.</span></p>
<h2><strong>A blend of academic divisions&#160;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for South Asian Studies integrates faculty from all academic divisions to further the program&#8217;s vision by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating conversations and projects that reach across historical, temporal, and cultural divides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Dean of Social Sciences Katharyne Mitchell emphasized the gift&#8217;s potential to reinforce the work done by CSAS faculty in the social sciences sphere.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am so grateful to Anu and Thomas for this extraordinary gift,&#8221; Mitchell said. &#8220;It will enable us to expand our social sciences programming in exciting new ways, as well as shine a spotlight on the superb work of the faculty working on South Asia and the South Asian diaspora. This includes work on migration, food, indigenous rights, racial and ethnic identity, and much more. This is indeed a game changer.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, CSAS is home to faculty renowned for work in South Asian art forms. CSAS promotes performances and the study of fine art, music, dance, and food across South Asian cultures.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anu Luther Maitra and Thomas Kailath&#8217;s gift to UCSC ensures the abundance of knowledge enabled by the interdisciplinary studies of South Asia,&#8221; said UCSC Dean of Arts Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu. &#8220;As an Asian Americanist working on visual cultures and film and performance studies that include South Asia, I am so pleased that the focus on the arts&#8212;from the work of Satyajit Ray and Bollywood film to the music and dance of the South Asian diaspora&#8212;will be bolstered on our campus. To be educated at UCSC is to study these important contributions, traditions, and knowledge that will certainly increase feelings of belonging and expand our understanding of each other in a multiracial society.&#8221;</span></p>

Lewis &#8217;24, politics) spent her summer interning </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the House of Representatives at the Office of Congressman Jimmy Panetta. An experience she says enhanced her educational experience at UCSC, and allowed her to explore a career path she hadn&#8217;t been able to before.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a scholarship from Transforming Futures&#8212;a pilot scholarship program launched by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Institute for Social Transformation in Summer 2022&#8212;Safi wouldn&#8217;t have been able to pursue the unpaid internship and stay in Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew that I wanted to do an internship as a learning experience, and I would work my hardest toward making it happen in some way,&#8221; Safi said. &#8220;Receiving this scholarship helped in relieving the extra stress and pressure from needing to juggle multiple responsibilities at once.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transforming Futures&#8217;s mission is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">open up opportunities and remove financial barriers for first-generation, underrepresented, and/or low-income college students at UC Santa Cruz so they can participate in career-advancing summer internships. Seven UCSC students were awarded up to $6,000 in Transforming Futures Scholarships. These students pursued internships at local non-profit organizations, California government, and an Oakland-based non-profit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wanted to apply for the scholarship because I found out I was accepted for a summer internship that was unpaid and I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to stay in Santa Cruz without some sort of stipend,&#8221; Safi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safi was the only Transforming Futures recipient to pursue an internship in California government. It included answering constituent phone calls, writing daily news summaries, and filing casework involving federal agencies like the IRS, Social Security Administration, and Department of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safi had also expressed interest in policy work and had the opportunity to work with the policy team in Washington DC. She took notes on caucus briefings, drafted a policy proposal, and wrote up policy cosponsoring recommendations&#8212;some policies of which Congressman Panetta ended up cosponsoring.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard a lot of people say that the heart of what you learn about in your career is done through outside experience and interactions in the real world, rather than solely in the classroom," Safi said. "I think that that was definitely the case for me in this internship which has elevated my understanding of what I&#8217;ve already learned in class.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safi&#8217;s summer with the office of Congressman Panetta was not the first time she&#8217;s come across policy proposals, or advocated for what she believed in. In October 2021 Safi&#8217;s work on a coalition pushing for menstrual equity in California saw Gov. Gavin Newsom sign AB 367 into law. The unfunded mandate requires all public schools grades 6&#8211;12, along with community and state universities, to stock restrooms with free menstrual products in 2022. The law had excluded UC systems, but that didn&#8217;t stop Safi from providing basic necessities to UCSC students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://lookout.co/santacruz/ucsc-cabrillo/story/2022-02-21/ucsc-student-leads-charge-to-provide-free-menstrual-products-to-students-on-campus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">February 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Safi equipped every UC Santa Cruz women&#8217;s and all gender bathrooms with free menstrual product dispensers, and disposal bins in each stall.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People don&#8217;t need to buy toilet paper and soap when they go into a public restroom,&#8221; said Safi in a</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/02/safi-amanda-menstrual-equity.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> past interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Just the idea of needing a quarter to pay for a necessary biological event is kind of ridiculous.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safi&#8217;s roots as a period equity activist began her senior year at Aragon High School in San Mateo County, and continues to grow. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she is not set on what she wants to pursue after graduating from UCSC, Safi said her summer internship experience provided invaluable insight that she will never forget.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think that this is such a great program for students that the university should continue after this pilot,&#8221; Safi said. &#8220;I would not have been able to have this amazing summer internship experience without the scholarship.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All funds for Transforming Futures were made available through the generosity of donors MR Macgill and Ho Nam.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

<p><span>These themes are intentionally broad to allow opportunities for input and creativity. Committees for each theme will now begin to gather ideas and input in each area. The plan will be opportunity-focused, identifying strengths and emergent areas of research, education and service that can advance our global and regional impact, improve the experiences of our community members, and strengthen the university in our push to lead at the intersection of innovation and social justice. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span>What can you bring to the table? Your ideas! Your thoughts! In our experience, strategic planning only succeeds when it reflects a wide range of perspectives. Nobody understands UC Santa Cruz as well as the people who make up our campus community, so your input in this process is invaluable. We need to harness the incredibly wide range of knowledge and experience our community holds, then collectively establish goals for the future and metrics by which we will measure our progress.</span></p>
<p><span>Fortunately, we are not starting from scratch. Over the past decade-plus, our campus community has undertaken a number of long-term planning efforts. The Envision UC Santa Cruz plan that launched a decade ago, the Strategic Academic Plan (SAP) of five years ago, and our recently completed Long Range Development Plan all include valuable pieces that will inform this strategic planning effort. We are grateful for the hard work done previously.</span></p>
<p><span>We&#8217;re working to make getting involved in this effort as easy as possible. Start by visiting the new </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/strategic-plan/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664924095960000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ixLdNNOccMYmZyVgIX3Ja" href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/strategic-plan/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Leading the Change webpage</span></a></span><span>, which will be a clearing house of information throughout the year. The dates and places of upcoming meetings will be posted there. We&#8217;ll also communicate important meetings, milestones and opportunities for input via email and through Tuesday Newsday, the campus news blast that is sent to all in our community once a week. A survey will be forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span>Strategic planning is an incredible opportunity for our community to shape the future of a university already positively impacting our world. Join us in this effort. We cannot wait to see where we go next.</span></p>

It is an online application used for Travel &amp; Entertainment reconciliation of Corporate Travel &amp; Entertainment (CTE) Card Expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CruzFly replaces the CTE Travel &amp; Entertainment Reconciliation form (TERF) and the Entertainment Reporting Addendum (ERA) form and provides an electronic solution for the reconciliation of CTE Card statements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CruzFly is now being used across campus by more than 75% of the UCSC CTE Cardholders.&#160; Rollout of the system is being done per business unit, with the expectation that all CTE Cardholders will be using CruzFly by March 2023. CTE Cardholders will continue to use the existing TERF process until their business unit has been rolled into CruzFly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the future, functionality will be added to the CruzFly system to allow processing of Out of Pocket Reimbursements as well. This is planned to occur after the CruzFly system for CTE Card Reconciliation has been rolled out to all campus units. Until that occurs, the </span><a href="https://financial.ucsc.edu/Pages/WF_DS_Entry.aspx?WF=PostTravelExpense"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post Travel Expense Form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be submitted for all Out of Pocket Reimbursements.</span></p>

<p><strong>Corporate Travel and Entertainment (CTE) Cards</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTE Cards are the preferred method of payment for employee travel and entertainment related purchases. With the launch of CruzFly, CTE Card reconciliation is fast and convenient for the cardholder and unit approvers.

<p>The award recognizes Greider for her pioneering work in telomere research, for which she shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Telomeres are critical structures that maintain the ends of chromosomes, and telomere shortening is associated with aging and disease. Greider&#8217;s achievements include the discovery of telomerase, the enzyme that maintains telomere length. She studies the roles that telomeres and telomerase play in cancer and age-related degenerative diseases.</p>
<p>In addition to the Nobel Prize, which she shared with Elizabeth Blackburn and Jack Szostak, Greider was awarded the 2006 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research and has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Inventors, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. She is a Foreign Member of both the Royal Academy of Medicine of Catalonia and the Royal Spanish Academy of Sciences. Her many other honors include the Lila Gruber Cancer Research Award; Wiley Prize in Biomedical Sciences; Dickson Prize in Medicine; Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize; and the American Society for Women in Science - Pinnacle Award.</p>
<p>Greider will accept the Award for Excellence in November during the AMP 2022 Annual Meeting &amp; Expo in Phoenix, where she will deliver a special lecture on &#8220;Telomeres, Telomerase and Disease.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a4461e2d80727046219b1d3bd82a853d"><name>summer-session-2022</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Students created a summer of success</title><summary>This summer, over 11,000 students enrolled in more than 70,000 UC Santa Cruz credits across departments and colleges and through the one-credit Slug Orientation course. &#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This summer, students enrolled in more than 70,000 UC Santa Cruz credits across departments and colleges and through the one-credit Slug Orientation course. Support for the growth of Summer Session was a campuswide initiative for 2020-21, and participation continues to be a contributing factor to positive student outcomes. Over a quarter of our degree-seeking undergraduates use summer to make progress.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://advising.ucsc.edu/success/3-year-pathways/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Year Pathways</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed to utilize summer fuel UCSC ranking of the second highest three-year graduation rate in the UCs, 1 in 12 of 2018-entering first year students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This summer, our Senate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committee on Educational Policy (CEP)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> authorized course sponsors to determine instructional modality of their summer courses. This allowed course sponsoring agencies to focus on providing a mix of in-person, remote, and online courses. This delegation came with concern for increased housing costs and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the desire to support students in minimizing their time to degree. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mix of undergraduate course modalities provided students with access to more of the courses that they needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning this summer, one of the university&#8217;s most important experiential learning programs,</span> <a href="https://studyabroad.ucsc.edu/programs/ucscfaculty-led/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Seminars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ran nine UC Santa Cruz courses around the world with 125 students participating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are excited we could accommodate so many Slugs in different situations for their needs,&#8221; said Monica Parikh, director of summer session. &#8220;We&#8217;ve heard directly from students that our flexibility during these unique few months let them take part in a huge diversity of opportunities like study abroad, service learning and field studies, upper divisions and senior seminars, prereqs, general education, and independent studies.&#8221; Parikh also learned many summer faculty who would have otherwise been unable to teach, were able to due the versatility of department discretion for instruction mode.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other programs with high attendance included</span> <a href="https://summer.ucsc.edu/summer-edge/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer Edge</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for those newly admitted to start their UCSC education before fall. Over 400 took summer classes; surveys indicate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">96% of first-year students and 100% of transfer students would recommend starting with Summer Edge to next year&#8217;s new Slugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since adding online and remote courses, our pre-college</span> <a href="https://summer.ucsc.edu/how-to-enroll/high-school-summer-start.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High School Summer University</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">program continues to grow in popularity. Over 220 students earned valuable UC credits, an over 20% increase over last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 9, the Summer 2023 courses will be listed at summer.ucsc.edu for everyone to warm up to summer this winter.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a476948380727046219b1d3bcdd49113"><name>innovation-impact-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Honoring our innovative and creative faculty</title><summary>The Chancellor’s Innovation Impact Awards is a new program that celebrates our talented faculty, researchers, staff, students, and community partners for their outstanding contributions to innovation and creativity that catalyze transformative change and societal impact.</summary><start-date>1664866800000</start-date><path>/2022/10/innovation-impact-awards</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/innovation-impact-awards</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1664911578216</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1664911578216</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am excited to announce the debut of the Chancellor&#8217;s Innovation Impact Awards. This new program celebrates our talented faculty, researchers, staff, students, and community partners for their outstanding contributions to innovation and creativity that catalyze transformative change and societal impact. Each year, the awards will provide us the opportunity to recognize transformational work across UC Santa Cruz &#8212; in the arts, engineering, humanities, physical and biological sciences, and social sciences. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nominations are now open for the </span><strong>Innovator of the Year </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">award. This award will recognize faculty and associated project teams that may include staff and students for innovative work that, during the past 12 months, has resulted in societal impact or has reached a milestone that positions the innovations for near-term societal impact. Nominations are encouraged from all academic disciplines and areas of study. Up to two awardees will be recognized, and the lead faculty member&#8217;s project will receive a $10,000 research award to further advance their efforts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All faculty, staff and students are invited to </span><a href="https://ucsc.infoready4.com/#competitionDetail/1882869"><strong>submit nominations</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; no self-nominations will be accepted. The </span><strong>nomination</strong> <strong>deadline is Nov. 10. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The awardees will be announced Thursday, Feb. 23.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Innovation Impact Awards Program also recognizes work in two additional categories:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><strong>Lifetime Achievement in Innovation</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> honors a faculty member whose career accomplishments include innovations that have led to significant, long-term societal impact and who is an inspiration and positive influence for students and colleagues. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><strong>Community Changemaker</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be awarded to a leader or organization in the Santa Cruz region who has contributed significantly to regional economic prosperity through innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship, or support for growing the innovation ecosystem in close collaboration with the university. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More information is available on the </span><a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/iatc/iiap/index.html"><strong>Innovation Impact Awards website</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m truly in awe of our faculty, students and staff, and of the scholarship, research, innovation and creativity that unfolds at our university every day. Please join me in celebrating their remarkable contributions to our campus, the state, and the world by submitting a nomination for Innovator of the Year.&#160;</span></p>

the university&#8217;s top leaders announced Monday.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is on an incredible trajectory. It is one of just a handful of universities that conducts high-impact research, is both a Hispanic-Serving and an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution, and is a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strategic plan aims to provide opportunities for campus improvement and transformation impacting a wide cross section of campus constituents and experiences. The work will seek to advance </span><a href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/initiatives/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campus goals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around student success, research impact, diversity and inclusion, and sustainability and resiliency, and establish clear metrics by which success will be measured over the next decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Strategic planning is an incredible opportunity for our community to shape the future of a university already positively impacting our world,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer said in a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/10/shaping-the-future.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">message to campus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> formally announcing the planning effort.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These themes are intentionally broad to allow opportunities for input and creativity. Committees for each theme will now begin to gather ideas and input in each area. The plan will be opportunity-focused, identifying strengths and emergent areas of research, education and service that can advance the university&#8217;s global and regional impact, improve the experiences of community members, and strengthen the campus push to lead at the intersection of innovation and social justice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading the Change: The UC Santa Cruz Strategic Plan will build on past planning efforts. The Envision UC Santa Cruz plan that launched a decade ago, the Strategic Academic Plan (SAP) of five years ago, and the recently completed Long Range Development Plan all include valuable pieces that will inform this strategic planning effort.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in the campus community are encouraged to participate. The </span><a href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/strategic-plan/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading the Change webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes the charges for each committee and will serve as clearing house of information throughout the year. The dates and places of upcoming meetings will be posted there. Organizers will also communicate important meetings, milestones and opportunities for input via email and through </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday Newsday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the campus news blast that is sent to all in our community once a week. A survey will be forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nobody understands UC Santa Cruz as well as the people who make up our campus community, so your input in this process is invaluable,&#8221; Larive and Kletzer said. &#8220;We need to harness the incredibly wide range of knowledge and experience our community holds, then collectively establish goals for the future and metrics by which we will measure our progress.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a8aa2af68072704679d5612ca96e1aa1"><name>brodsky-doe-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Research on shear strength of rock has implications for carbon sequestration</title><summary>With a $1.1 million grant from the Department of Energy, seismologist Emily Brodsky will address seismic challenges involved in carbon sequestration, geothermal energy, and other areas.</summary><keywords>Emily Brodsky</keywords><start-date>1664953200000</start-date><display-name>Research on shear strength of rock has implications for carbon sequestration</display-name><path>/2022/10/brodsky-doe-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/brodsky-doe-grant</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1664982067938</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1664982431198</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/emily-brodsky-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/emily-brodsky-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>emily-brodsky-350.jpg</name><display-name>emily-brodsky-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>110199</file-size><width>350</width><height>393</height></image><image-alt>Emily Brodsky</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/emily-brodsky-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/emily-brodsky-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>emily-brodsky-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>emily-brodsky-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>28606</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Emily Brodsky</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Emily Brodsky (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>With a $1.1 million grant from the Department of Energy, seismologist Emily Brodsky will address seismic challenges involved in carbon sequestration, geothermal energy, and other areas</article-subhead><article-text><p>Emily Brodsky, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has received a $1.1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to study the shear strength of rocks in the Earth&#8217;s crust and the conditions in which they break, which generates earthquakes.</p>
<p>Any activities that involve pumping fluids into or out of the ground have the potential to induce earthquakes by changing the stresses within the Earth&#8217;s crust. Examples include hydraulic fracturing (&#8220;fracking&#8221;) in the oil and gas industry, geothermal wells, groundwater management, and carbon sequestration by injecting carbon dioxide deep underground. Characterizing and predicting the conditions in which rocks fail is key to the sustainability of these activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to understand what&#8217;s going to make the rocks break,&#8221; Brodsky said.</p>
<p>Geologic carbon sequestration (storing carbon dioxide in underground geologic formations) could be a major tool for fighting global climate change, but induced earthquakes could potentially scuttle the technology, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Induced earthquakes could be the Achilles heel of carbon sequestration. If the rocks fail you no longer have sequestration&#8212;it breaks the confinement of the carbon dioxide, and you&#8217;ve just wasted time and money while getting no closer to a climate change solution,&#8221; Brodsky explained.</p>
<p>Much of the current understanding of shear failure in rocks is based on laboratory experiments commonly performed on centimeter-scale samples. These results are then extrapolated to field settings where failure can occur on scales from meters to kilometers, and that worries Brodsky.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of ways in which that might be a bad extrapolation,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our research will focus on this scalability problem&#8212;how do we take knowledge based on laboratory samples and scale it up to field scales.&#8221;</p>
<p>The project combines theoretical, experimental, and observational approaches toward a better description of shear strength in the crust at the scale of relevance for earthquakes and other failure events. The grant from the DOE&#8217;s Office of Basic Energy Sciences will support two postdoctoral researchers and a graduate student.</p>
<p>The observational studies will involve analyzing the roughness of fault surfaces and the role of friction in the shear strength of faults. The research will also include statistical analyses of the distribution and abundance of induced earthquakes as a function of applied stress.</p>
<p>The DOE grant is enabling a pivot of Brodsky&#8217;s research towards laboratory work. For the laboratory studies, Brodsky&#8217;s team has developed a method using a transparent material that models the elastic properties of rock on a small scale to capture the dynamics of fully confined ruptures. The experiments provide insight into the correct interpretation of stress drops and failure stresses for events that only partially break an interface.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rocks are elastic&#8212;they deform&#8212;and only part of the fault ruptures in an earthquake. By using a material that&#8217;s squishier than rock, we can model that on a smaller scale, and because it&#8217;s a transparent material, we can get movies of the rupture process,&#8221; Brodsky explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s fun for me that I&#8217;m becoming an experimentalist 20 years into my career.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a99991248072704679d5612c61b70945"><name>guthaus-ic-report</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>NSF report led by UCSC computer engineer offers guidance for the future of chip design and manufacturing</title><summary>A new report from a National Science Foundation (NSF) steering committee led by UC Santa Cruz Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Matthew Guthaus offers guidance on revitalizing the hardware workforce by increasing access to education.</summary><start-date>1664985600000</start-date><path>/2022/10/guthaus-ic-report</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/guthaus-ic-report</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1664997757199</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1664997757199</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/matt-guthaus.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/matt-guthaus.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>matt-guthaus.jpeg</name><display-name>matt-guthaus.jpeg</display-name><file-size>47396</file-size><width>250</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Matt Guthaus.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/matt-guthaus80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/matt-guthaus80.png</link><site>news</site><name>matt-guthaus80.png</name><display-name>matt-guthaus80.png</display-name><file-size>16203</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Matt Guthaus.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Matthew Guthaus.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although semiconductor chips affect nearly every facet of American life from cell phones to cars to healthcare, the country is facing a shortage of both the hardware itself and students educated to take on jobs in design and manufacturing. A <a href="https://nsf-ic-education.com/report/"><span class="s2">new report</span></a> from a National Science Foundation (NSF) steering committee led by UC Santa Cruz Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Matthew Guthaus offers guidance on revitalizing the hardware workforce by increasing access to education.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The recently passed CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law in August 2022, aims to promote semiconductor research, development, and production in the United States and will do so in part through funds administered through the NSF. Over the course of two workshops that gathered faculty from various universities, many of them from smaller state schools and minority-serving institutions, as well as representatives from industry and manufacturing, the steering committee generated recommendations for how the NSF might best spend those funds to promote healthy workforce development.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The main proposal of the report is the establishment of a National Chip Design Center that would position circuit engineering as a viable career path and bring down the cost for universities to educate students in this field.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&#8220;Accessibility is the number one issue,&#8221; Guthaus said. &#8220;Everything stems from that &#8211; more schools, more classes, more students, more designers, more innovation.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the main problems for the future of the semiconductor workforce, the report states, is that students no longer see the field as an attractive career path. While software engineering and its subfields have seen massive growth, estimates show that by 2030 there will only be enough qualified candidates to fill thirty percent of semiconductor manufacturing jobs.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&#8220;Students are going into these other areas of internet startups and machine learning startups that seem like they're having a broader impact, but the point is that a lot of those things are only possible because the hardware is still supporting it,&#8221; Guthaus said.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the face of declining enrollments, universities are challenged to offer courses in chip design, which can be difficult and expensive to run, both because of the cost of materials and the barriers presented to the schools in accessing confidential, state-of-the-art software and other information to design the chips.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While some elite schools have partnerships with companies like Google or Apple that give them extra resources, the report recommends that the National Chip Design Center would help even this playing field and allow smaller schools with more diverse student populations to offer these classes. This could also help address the stark lack of diversity within the chip manufacturing field today.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&#8220;We need some way of amortizing the expense of setting up the design infrastructure so that many universities can replicate the same thing that a few schools are able to do right now,&#8221; Guthaus said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Direct scholarships are another method recommended by the committee for how the NSF can support students entering the field, especially for students at state schools and minority-serving institutions. Teaching grants for educators could also help schools continue to offer hardware design classes when faced with smaller budgets&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The report also recommends open-sourcing hardware design whenever possible to decrease educational barriers. Without the expense of paying licensing fees for the tools needed to produce chips, or the need for universities to sign confidentiality agreements to use proprietary design tools, teaching chip design can become more accessible.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This idea has already proved successful in recent years when Google paid to open source an older chip technology from semiconductor engineering companies such as <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/07/SkyWater-and-Google-expand-open-source-program-to-new-90nm-technology.html"><span class="s2">SkyWater</span></a> and <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/08/GlobalFoundries-joins-Googles-open-source-silicon-initiative.html"><span class="s2">GlobalFoundries</span></a>, which Guthaus and other faculty then used to teach students to design chips at their universities. For companies like Google, a larger community of people educated on hardware design means a better potential workforce for sparking innovation.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Additionally, the report recommends providing more educational outreach programs to students at the K-12 level to help eliminate the layers of abstraction between phones and other devices and the hardware that runs them to encourage early interest in the field.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a9aa3b2c8072704679d5612ccd1d9876"><name>supporting-human-rights</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Supporting human rights and condemning the death of Mahsa Amini and others killed in resulting protests</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is committed to upholding fundamental human rights.

As a branch of the <a href="https://ucsc-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/28PPAs0-Id-e6HFA7YFqCdjOPa424ZqGx-ImrEqMeR38ssdKagwG6E8H7jq7TW93FQgiF4cbOlP6FRY0uwkALYhy7tebflwGMuwuOYV8K-VLXlullRiA4nyDjZ_gjVsE_PaYdTFqXaGrepdPtkii_YDO3TFn6dspiT0P1P_2spkMVJQ"><span class="s2">broader UCSC CIDER</span></a>, this program has been established to train students who are historically underrepresented in aviation and STEM on the use and application of drones in a variety of fields to provide experiential learning and professional development skills that are transferable to future careers.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In late November, 20 students will be selected to participate in a two quarter program to receive training on drone safety, hardware and sensors, mission planning, flight operation, data processing, remote sensing, FAA part 107 license training, and more. Students will meet twice per week for two hours a day for eight weeks during winter quarter (January 13 - March 10) and spring quarter (April 10 - June 9). During the first quarter, students will focus on preparation for the FAA Part 107 commercial drone pilot license test and will be introduced to manual and automated flight and the various drone platforms we use. The second quarter will focus on designing projects, autonomous data collection, data processing in drone deploy, and data analysis in GIS.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although this is a non-credit opportunity, students will be given a $1,000 stipend for participating in the program. The program will also cover the $175 fee for students to take their FAA Part 107 test, and students who pass their FAA Part 107 will be eligible to help conduct paid flights for projects on campus.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Our goal is to <strong>prioritize students from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM and support underserved students at UCSC.</strong> </span><span class="s1">In alignment with the program's goals and its role within the university, priority will be given to 2nd- and 3rd-year students, but motivated freshman, seniors, and graduate students are encouraged to apply in the event that there is space available. </span><span class="s3">All students must be in good academic standing with the university.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Evidence of effectiveness and intentionality in institutional practices serving Latinx students;</li>
<li>Positive momentum for Latinx student progress in their data;</li>
<li>Dedication to transforming the institution into an environment where Latinx students thrive; and</li>
<li>Strategies in leadership that clearly articulate institutional focus on advancing Latinx student success.</li>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rewarding, moving, and joyful.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Crown College alums&#8212;Lisa Rose, Jim Lapsley, and Susan Nerton&#8212;banded together to organize Crown&#8217;s 50th reunion during Alumni Week in April 2022. When asked what it felt like to see their organizing come to life, &#8216;rewarding, moving, and joyful&#8217; were just a few words that came to mind.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience to be there 50-some years later and to see all these friends and to have this incredible emotional reunion,&#8221; Lapsley said. &#8220;People came to the reunion, and it felt like 50 years ago was just yesterday; it was magical.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rose, Lapsley, and Nerton have become some of the most active members of the UC Santa Cruz alumni community since graduating from the university between 1971-72. Their time, talents, and gifts to the college support current students, bolster alumni engagement, and elevate the campus they once walked as students themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were founding members of the Crown Provost Advisory Committee (CPAC) and some of the projects they led include fundraising for the complete renovation of Crown&#8217;s Library, upgrading the Fireside Lounge, and programming for Alumni Day weekend to reconnect alumni with Crown.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their most recent endeavor is raising $1 million for the Crown College endowment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We realized this endowment is really important, because there are gaps that need to be filled,&#8221; Rose said. &#8220;Our hope is that endowment funds will elevate students&#8217; academic experiences at Crown College.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crown College endowment is one of the facets the college uses to help pay for a variety of courses offered through Crown that support student academic success and professional development, as well as activities aimed at fostering student wellbeing. Crown endowment funds give students the intellectual and practical tools to succeed well after graduating from UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The substantial growth in Crown&#8217;s endowment that this campaign is aiming for will open the door to the development of alumni and emeriti faculty-supported programs, the design of programs targeting transfer students, and will enable a significant expansion of faculty-mentored internship programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rose, Lapsley, and Nerton have all made commitments to the Crown College endowment through a Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD) from their Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA). A QCD is a direct transfer of funds from an IRA, payable to a qualified charity, and can be counted toward satisfying required minimum distributions (RMDs) for the year, as long as certain rules are met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The balance between academic excellence and what students need is crucial,&#8221; Nerton said. &#8220;Manel [Crown College Provost Manel Camps] has been very forward thinking in the kinds of academic programs that he wants to fund, courses that he wants to fund, and then being able to support the students in those groups&#8212;it&#8217;s a delicate balance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provost Camps said one of his primary goals is to increase meaningful student and faculty interaction, which is at the heart of what many Crown alums recognize as vital to their UCSC experience. He said he is extremely grateful to have a dedicated cohort of Crown alumni like Rose, Lapsley, and Nerton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m in awe,&#8221; Provost Camps said. &#8220;I listen attentively to Jim, Lisa and Su because their exceptional commitment to Crown is telling us something about where Crown should be."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rose, Lapsley, and Nerton all give their time, money, and talents to UCSC for various reasons, but common ground for the trio is their desire to give back to the college community that shaped their formative years and overall outlook.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I very much treasure the formative experiences we had at Crown and the sense of community developed there,&#8221; Lapsley said. &#8220;Much of it came from the residential college system&#8212;people in dormitories, taking the same classes together, and having to think about the same things&#8212;and I want to see that continue because I think it&#8217;s a really great educational model.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio also emphasized that the conditions they grew to know and love as students of Crown College are rapidly changing amid decades-long national college tuition increases and increasing housing complexities in Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19_330.10.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the National Center for Education Statistics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for the 1970-71 academic year, the average in-state tuition and fees for one year at a public, non-profit university were $394&#8212;adjusting for inflation that is equal to $2,914 in 2022. By the 2020-21 academic year, that amount jumped to $10,560.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the rising price of higher education is a national issue, Rose, Lapsley, and Nerton are adamant about supporting students in their own backyard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My mother would always remind me that she never had to pay a penny for my college education, and now the cost is drastically more,&#8221; Rose said. &#8220;I just felt gutted by that information, and I figure as soon as anybody absorbs those numbers, they&#8217;re gonna want to do what they can to support current students.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provost Camps said that the trio&#8217;s dedication to the college further motivates him to provide the best experience for Crown students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lisa, Jim, Su, and I have built a relationship that's more than just donor to recipient,&#8221; Provost Camps said. &#8220;I see them as friends, and I have an admiration for their passion and dedication towards Crown.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p>Ramirez-Ruiz, who holds the Vera Rubin Presidential Chair for Diversity in Astronomy at UCSC, is among 11 new fellows to be recognized during the academy&#8217;s annual Fellows Gathering on October 11, 2022.</p>
<p>The new fellows also include alumnus Scott Shaffer, who earned his Ph.D. in biology at UCSC in 2000. Now a professor of biological sciences at San Jose State University, Shaffer remains affiliated with UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences and Department of Ocean Sciences as a research associate and lecturer. He studies the physiological ecology of vertebrate animals, especially birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz is a theoretical astrophysicist who tests out his theories with complex computer simulations that defy the boundaries of human experience and the assumptions we make about the universe. He is a leading authority on some of the most dramatic events in the universe, such as collisions, mergers, and disruptions of stars&#8212;especially those involving compact objects like black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz has mentored over 200 students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, and he has worked vigorously to support the promotion and retention of women and people from under-represented groups in astronomy and related fields. He established and directs the Lamat program, which has been transformative at increasing the number of women and students from historically marginalized groups who earn doctoral degrees in astrophysics.</p>
<p>Fellows of the California Academy of Sciences are nominated by their colleagues and selected by the Board of Trustees. They help further the reach of the academy&#8217;s research and education initiatives through individual and collaborative efforts with academy researchers.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c29d352e807270466f048501aa7d83ea"><name>green-collab-nobel</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC engineer played crucial role in 2022 Nobel Prize-winning research</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz Baskin School of Engineering Professor Richard (Ed) Green was a major contributor to the Neanderthal Genome Project , the leader of which, Svante Pääbo, received the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.</summary><start-date>1665385200000</start-date><path>/2022/10/green-collab-nobel</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/green-collab-nobel</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1665417426195</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1665418026268</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Dy1HCWwzds" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></embed><width>350</width><caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch Ed Green describe his work in sequencing the Neanderthal genome and what this means for the history of early modern humans.</span></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/ed-green-.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/ed-green-.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>ed-green-.jpeg</name><display-name>ed-green-.jpeg</display-name><file-size>87020</file-size><width>350</width><height>522</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/ed-green_80.png</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/ed-green_80.png</link><site>news</site><name>ed-green_80.png</name><display-name>ed-green_80.png</display-name><file-size>14107</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ed Green holds replicas of the bones from which Neanderthal DNA was extracted for genome sequencing and a Neanderthal skull.

</article-subhead><article-text><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Swedish geneticist Svante P&#228;&#228;bo for his research on human evolution, specifically in using contemporary tools to sequence and compare the genomes of Neanderthals and Denisovans to modern day humans. The research revealed mixing between the earliest modern humans and Neanderthals.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">UC Santa Cruz Baskin School of Engineering Professor Richard (Ed) Green was a major contributor to the Neanderthal Genome Project as the co-author of four of the six "key publications," and first author on two, cited in the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2022/press-release/"><span class="s2">Nobel announcement</span></a>.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I couldn't be happier about this award for Svante,&#8221; Green said. &#8220;It's such well-deserved recognition for the importance of the field and for the impact of having genomes from our closest extinct relatives.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Green began working on the Neanderthal genome as a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, where P&#228;&#228;bo led the international consortium of researchers working on the Neanderthal Genome Project and still serves as the institute&#8217;s director. After developing special methods to extract ancient DNA from the 40,000-year-old bones of Neanderthals, the group sequenced that DNA and was able to make key discoveries about the origins of our species.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Green led major bioinformatics efforts behind this project, writing software and developing computational techniques needed to analyze ancient DNA extracted from fossil bones. He also helped coordinate the design and logistics of the project.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This work showed that shortly after early modern humans migrated out of Africa, some interbred with Neanderthals, as evidenced by pieces of Neanderthal DNA found throughout the genomes of all non-Africans.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">"The Neanderthal genome is a goldmine of information about recent human evolution, and it will be put to use for years to come," Green said at the time of the findings in 2010.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c36af683807270466f04850146a50930"><name>tahir-amin-intellectual-property-wars</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Tahir Amin to speak about unequal access to medications and the global fallout from intellectual property wars: October 18 talk in downtown Santa Cruz</title><summary>Tahir Amin, a critic of the power structures that result in the unequal distribution of desperately needed medications across the globe, will be the inaugural speaker of the Sawyer Series focusing on “Race, Empire, and the Environments of Biomedicine.”  &#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amin will talk about this pressing issue at 7 p.m., Tuesday, October 18 at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center in downtown Santa Cruz. Doors open at 6 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The talk is presented by The Humanities Institute at UCSC. The event is free and open to the public, but advance registration is required. </span><a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=4384&amp;cid=9575"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reserve your seat here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amin is the inaugural speaker for the Sawyer Seminar series of public lectures, scholarly talks, and reading and discussion groups focusing on &#8220;Race, Empire, and the Environments of Biomedicine.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amin is executive director of the Initiative for Medicines, Access &amp; Knowledge (I-MAK), a nonprofit organization working to address structural inequities in how medicines are developed and distributed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He argues that excessive vigilance about patents and intellectual property interfere with the distribution of life-saving technologies, especially in the poorest nations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amin has over 25 years of experience in intellectual property (IP) law. In that time, Amin has practiced with two of the leading IP law firms in the United Kingdom and served as IP Counsel for multinational corporations. His work focuses on re-shaping IP law and the related global political economy to better serve the public interest.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate professor of history Jennifer Derr, whose scholarship explores the intersections among science, medicine, and the environment, will introduce the event. Anna Barry-Jester, a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Propublica </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reporter covering global health, infectious diseases, and pandemics, will be in conversation with Amin after he gives a brief presentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mellon Sawyer seminar, which will run throughout 2022-2023, takes a critical look at American biomedicine, while examining how issues regarding race, imperialism, and the environment impact the ways that medications are developed and distributed.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This series is supported by the Mellon Foundation and presented in partnership with the Science and Justice Research Center. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $225,000 award supports the Sawyer Seminar series on the Comparative Study of Culture, bringing scientists, physicians, and scholars of the humanities and social sciences together with students and members of the UCSC community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kuumbwa event is timely for the UCSC community, especially considering </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that UC scholars have been taking aim at inequities in the distribution of much-needed medication.</span></p>
<p><strong>Addressing structural inequities in a time of need</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amin argues that the globalization of intellectual property, starting in the 1980s, has coincided with some of the world&#8217;s deadliest pandemics, epidemics and outbreaks, from HIV, hepatitis C, SARS, and, most recently, COVID -19.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former Harvard Medical School Fellow in the Department of Global Health &amp; Social Medicine and TED Fellow, Amin has served as legal advisor/consultant to many international groups, including the European Patent Office and World Health Organization, and has testified before the U.S. Congress on intellectual property and unsustainable drug prices.</span></p>

But that long-standing reputation is broadening. A new arts initiative from UC Santa Cruz, <em><a href="https://www.unseencalifornia.com/">Unseen California</a></em>, aims to connect both professional artists and UC students with reserves. Challenging artists to engage with the human and natural history of California landscapes, the program seeks to make the arts an integral part of the NRS profile.</p>
<p>Launched in 2021 by UCSC Associate Professor of Art Karolina Karlic, <em>Unseen California</em> is an arts research initiative that engages diverse artist voices with research themes relevant to California&#8217;s future. The program also enables immersive learning experiences for UCSC art students and the community through programming, exhibitions, and an in-progress documentary film.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal is to be able to use the umbrella of <em>Unseen California</em> to support immersive arts field research,&#8221; Karlic says. Connecting with reserves, she adds, helps students &#8220;realize what it means to create site-specific work and connect with communities at large.&#8221; Meanwhile, the participating professional artists get to explore a wide range of ecological locations with assistance from knowledgeable NRS guides.</p>
<p>Reserve visits nudge artists to consider broader questions about their roles as they engage within reserve environments across California, Karlic says. &#8220;What is it that we carry with us as humans from engaging with a site? What does it mean to be a practicing artist out in the world?&#8221; This dovetails with the principles of the UCSC Art Department, which encourages students to grapple with environmental and community concerns in their art practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best question that a student has asked me at a natural reserve was, &#8216;what are we supposed to do here?&#8217;&#8221; Karlic says. &#8220;This question has driven the whole development of <em>Unseen California</em> as a research initiative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Launched in 2021 and intended to be a ten-year program, <em>Unseen California </em>has multiple facets. These include immersive art field research by cohorts of professional artists; teaching; and engagement with the public.</p>
<h2>A cohort of working artists</h2>
<p>The first artist research cohort consists of five women photographers from a wide variety of backgrounds. Each is an educator and a working professional in the arts.</p>
<p>The identities of the artists contrast starkly with the white, cis males (think Ansel Adams, Carleton Watkins, Edward Weston, and others) who have dominated the canon of landscape photography. The <em>Unseen California</em> artists seek to reframe cultural histories and ecological landscapes with alternative concepts enriched by their diverse identities and experiences. They operate under the conviction that the arts are central to solving the most urgent problems of our time, but require participation and engagement by disciplines and sectors across society.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very important for me to create a research cohort that extends outside of the university to engage with our students, with the natural reserves, and that the work expands back into their communities outside of the walls of the university,&#8221; Karlic says.</p>
<p>The residencies last for an unusually lengthy two years. This lets artists visit reserves multiple times over different seasons. Artists have the space to reflect on their experiences, and deepen their relationship to place and community with every return.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most generous part of this residency is the ongoing conversations and community that I feel is necessary as a woman photographer educator,&#8221; says artist Tarrah Krajnak. &#8220;Oftentimes the work of an artist is in solitude. Even though we&#8217;re all separated and at different institutions working across different reserves I feel actual support for the first time in over a decade.&#8221;</p>
<h2>A conversation between art and science</h2>
<p>Arts research can uncover knowledge about the landscape that is distinct from what can be gleaned by the practice of science, Karlic says. &#8220;We&#8217;re most typically not going in with a particular question in mind to collect data to find results. What we&#8217;re going in with is multiple questions and being informed by the site itself. We&#8217;re responding and interpreting those responses that happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact that human settlements as well as science questions have been studied at reserves makes the NRS an ideal place to host the initiative. Reserve staff have been helping transmit knowledge about their sites to artists, fostering inspiration and insight in the process. &#8220;Experiences with the reserve managers are really integral to being supportive of the curiosities and the research that the artists are engaging with their particular chosen site. Those relationships are propelling and making connections for the artists working across different research themes,&#8221; Karlic says.</p>
<p>An example is the work of artist Mercedes Dorame. Dorame herself is Tongva. She has chosen to work at Santa Cruz Island Reserve and Catalina Island in part because her ancestors inhabited what is now the Los Angeles Basin as well as the southern Channel Islands. Her study includes contrasting the feeling of safety and shelter on virtually uninhabited Santa Cruz Island with her experiences growing up and currently living in Los Angeles. During her explorations of the islands, she also has been creating a series of observations highlighting both the past and future potentials of these landscapes.</p>
<p>Jay Reti, director of the NRS&#8217;s Santa Cruz Island Reserve, has helped provide Dorame with a deeper sense of cultural connection to the island, says Karlic. &#8220;Jay is a paleoanthropologist. He&#8217;s very familiar with stone tools in his own research. That knowledge and understanding has been incredibly helpful for Mercedes, who is looking at the exchanges between the peoples of Santa Cruz Island and Catalina Island.&#8221;</p>
<h2>From acorn caches to fog residue</h2>
<p>At Hastings Natural History Reservation, artist <a href="https://www.aspenmays.com/">Aspen Mays</a> is working with reserve director Jen Hunter to reimagine the reserve&#8217;s museum. At present, the building is being used for storage; most of the plant and animal specimens as well as scientific notebooks were relocated to UC Berkeley. Mays will consider how the photographic, field notes, recordings, and other observations from Hastings can be made engaging for museum visitors.</p>
<p>In addition, Mays is investigating the lives of acorn woodpeckers, whose behaviors and interactions with oak trees have been studied at the reserve for more than 50 years. Mays is collaborating with former NRS Environmental IT Director Becca Fenwick, now with the <a href="https://cider.sites.ucsc.edu/people/">CITRIS Initiative for Drone Education and Research</a>, to gather 3D drone images of the granary trees where woodpeckers stash winter stores of acorns. Mays found an immediate resonance between her previous work on astronomical observations with the galaxies of acorns the woodpeckers store in granary trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without the support of Dr. Jen Hunter and reserve managers such as herself, we artists wouldn&#8217;t be able to do the work that we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; Karlic says.</p>
<p>At the NRS&#8217;s Steele/Burnand Anza-Borrego Desert Research Center, artist <a href="https://www.dionneleestudio.com/">Dionne Lee</a> is examining wilderness survival skills as a metaphor for grappling with harmful systems and historical structures, and acknowledging survival as an active attempt made every day. She is focusing on the fact that the reserve has been the site of anthropological excavations that have worn away rocks and soil in a process analogous to erosion. Lee writes that she broadens the definition of erosion &#8220;to include the consequences of human dominance on the land and position the act of erosion as a product of colonialism.&#8221; Similarly, she views the act of excavation&#8212;to expose, dig up, and sell&#8212; as a lens through which to examine what has been stolen and weathered by colonialism.</p>
<p>Artist <a href="https://www.tarrahkrajnak.com/">Tarrah Krajnak</a> has taken inspiration from an event that occurred at Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve: the speech photographer Ansel Adams delivered at the reserve&#8217;s dedication ceremony in 1978. Krajnak has studied recordings of Adams&#8217; speech and recorded herself performing a progressively more redacted version. This work continues her interest in showcasing the problematic aspects of modern photography&#8217;s canons via acts of erasure, redaction, and reenactment.</p>
<p>The coastal reserves of Big Creek and Santa Cruz Island have been the sites of some of Karlic&#8217;s own work. For years, scientists have set up fog collectors&#8212;vertical squares of mesh where airborne moisture can condense&#8212;to measure the amount of moisture fog supplies at different elevations at the reserve. Inspired by this data collecting tool, Karlic has set up similar vertical moisture collectors but substituted copper plates, typically used in print media, for the mesh. On Karlic&#8217;s collectors, fog leaves behind visual traces of its passage in the form of oxidized patterns on the metal.</p>
<p>Karlic has worked closely with Big Creek reserve director Mark Readdie, and stewards Feynner Arias and Mackneal Byers, to engage with multiple climate change events that have impacted the reserve. Her work at the reserve includes setting out trail cameras to document and photograph the movement of soils and impacts of burned vegetation after the Dolan Fire, which burned 8,000 acres of the reserve.</p>
<h2>Art classrooms without walls</h2>
<p>The educational component of <em>Unseen California</em> builds on the long history of UCSC arts faculty fostering community dialogues about the environment. This includes a decades-long effort by art professor Norman Locks to expose students to NRS reserves. Karlic will continue to bring undergraduates and MFA students from the Art Department&#8217;s new <a href="https://art.ucsc.edu/mfa">MFA program in Environmental Art and Social Practice</a> to reserves under the aegis of Unseen California to discover the value of field work and immersive learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;The photography research trips led by Karolina Karlic and Norman Locks were one of the most impactful experiences in my undergraduate studies at UCSC,&#8221; writes former art major Edgar Cruz. &#8220;As an artist, these trips were really important in helping me question and explore the ideas behind my work, which was new for me at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once in the field, students have opportunities to collect data, participate in field work, and learn about topics such as land, climate change, and ecology. These firsthand experiences allow students to get immersed in new subjects, which then influence their academic art research.</p>
<p>&#8220;These kinds of trips are essential for artists. Art is not always about the studio. There is some inspiration that only can be found out in the world,&#8221; writes Brian Young, who visited Landels-Hill Big Creek as an undergraduate art major in 2018.</p>
<p>At present, <em>Unseen California&#8217;s</em> operational needs are largely supported by grant funding. To support the professional and student artists whose work is at the core of the initiative, Karlic seeks donor assistance.

The University of California, Santa Cruz, politics and legal studies professor won two awards during the recent </span><a href="https://connect.apsanet.org/apsa2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Political Science Association (APSA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annual meeting. Founded in 1903, APSA is the leading professional association for the study of political science, serving 11,000 members in more than 100 countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud received the </span><a href="https://politicalsciencenow.com/congratulations-to-apsa-organized-section-award-recipients-sections-1-20/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">APSA Law &amp; Courts Section</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Teaching and Mentoring Award for his teaching efforts within and beyond UC Santa Cruz. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud directs UCSC&#8217;s </span><a href="https://legalstudies.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal Studies Program </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and is affiliated with the </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/centers/middle-east-and-north-africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for the Middle East and North Africa.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He is also a visiting professor at the University of Oxford Faculty of Law.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud is a past recipient of </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/06/excellence-in-teaching.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Excellence in Teaching Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the APSA award committee praised &#8220;his intentionality in putting teaching and mentorship at the center of his mission.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mark gives generously of himself to students at all levels,&#8221; the committee said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In undergraduate education, Massoud sparks students&#8217; natural curiosity, creating opportunities for individualized learning and making the study of law and politics relevant to students&#8217; lives and interests.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud has also organized workshops and mentoring programs for graduate students at UC Santa Cruz and across the world. While doing fieldwork in Somaliland, he taught research methods courses at a local university. He also organized writing and publishing workshops for African graduate students and postdoctoral scholars with colleagues at the University of Cape Town.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud enjoys helping early career scholars &#8220;find their voice&#8221; in their academic writing, and he said he approaches his own research as a form of teaching.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see teaching more broadly than what happens in a classroom,&#8221; Massoud said. &#8220;It also happens during office hours and when we create spaces for peer mentoring. It also happens through the publications we produce. The articles and books I write teach people new ways of thinking about what they already know, and that's what I try to do in the classroom too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the Teaching and Mentoring Award, Massoud received the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">APSA Ralph J. Bunche Award for his book,</span> <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/inshallah"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shari&#8216;a, Inshallah: Finding God in Somali Legal Politics</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bunche Award, named after the UCLA graduate and political scientist </span><a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1950/bunche/biographical/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, recognizes the best book in political science on ethnic and cultural pluralism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shari&#8216;a, Inshallah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also earned </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/04/sharia-inshallah-global-acclaim.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accolades</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year, winning book awards from the </span><a href="https://www.asanet.org/communities-sections/sections/current-sections/religion/sociology-religion-award-recipient-history"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Sociological Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://slsa.ac.uk/index.php/prizewinners#book"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socio-Legal Studies Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the </span><a href="https://publishers.org/news/association-of-american-publishers-announces-finalists-and-category-winners-for-2022-prose-awards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Association of American Publishers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The APSA Ralph J. Bunche Award is a discipline-wide award from nominated books across every subfield in political science. Internationally focused books, such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shari&#8216;a, Inshallah,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rarely earn this award; in the past 30 years, all but two other Bunche Award-winning books have covered race or ethnicity in the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To receive an award named for Ralph J. Bunche is very meaningful to me,&#8221; Massoud said. &#8220;Bunche taught political science, devoted his life to peace, and fought for ethnic and cultural pluralism in the United States and overseas. I am grateful that political scientists noticed my research and just as much that they noticed my teaching.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c7434bc1807270462f3150178dfdb48f"><name>bright-horizons</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Bright Horizons October webinars</title><summary>This month, Bright Horizons is offering two webinars aimed at supporting your family needs.</summary><start-date>1665471600000</start-date><path>/2022/10/bright-horizons</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/bright-horizons</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1665495419813</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1665495419813</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Sandra Messick</name><title></title><phone/><email>sgmessic@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month, Bright Horizons is offering two webinars aimed at supporting your family needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time in almost two years the residence halls are full of students and that means work has gone back to normal for Olivia Silva. Along with up to 140 Custodial Services staff and some Dining staff, Silva was one of many on-site workers who played a critical role in the campus response to COVID-19. They continued to come to campus to meet the increased demand for cleaning across campus after the university sent students and staff home to continue learning and working.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We worked every day, mostly in Colleges 9 and 10 because there were some students living there, international students who couldn&#8217;t go home. Our work moved there to take care of those students for a year. It was very scary and sometimes it was depressing but thank God we&#8217;re here now,&#8221; Silva said &#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her biggest fear was getting sick and exposing her family to the virus. &#8220;I was so worried. I wore my mask all the time at work and made sure to keep my distance from everyone. It was important to keep my family safe.&#8221; Her husband was also an essential worker so during the week their son and daughter were home alone attending school online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past 23 years, Silva has been part of the university&#8217;s custodial team keeping the residential halls on the westside of campus clean and safe. For personal reasons, that&#8217;s very important to her. &#8220;I want to do my best. I try to keep the students safe. I&#8217;m thinking if they were my daughter or son going to the university, I&#8217;d want everything clean.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each morning, Silva starts her workday at 7:30 with five minutes of stretching to get her body ready for the work ahead. After warming up, Silva gathers her supplies, puts on her goggles, gloves, and a facemask, gets her supplies and heads to Garden C and Garden D dorms in the lower quad of Rachel Carson College. She is one of six people assigned to the college. Silva cleans the public areas including the entrances, hallways, stairs, bathrooms, and windows - inside and out, and laundry rooms - including inside the machines. She takes pride in her work and students notice. &#8220;Some students say &#8216;thank you very much for your hard work&#8217;. Sometimes they give me gifts in the summer and at Christmas &#8211; flowers, cards or gift cards. Sometimes they put a note on my locker saying &#8216;Thank you for your hard work. You&#8217;re like my mom.&#8217;&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s strenuous work, especially in the summer months when the crews do what&#8217;s called first clean - a deep clean of every dorm room and apartment across campus at the end of the academic year. They also get rooms ready for the summer. &#8220;Groups are coming for conferences and summer programs and we keep the rooms clean while they&#8217;re here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silva started working at UC Santa Cruz the summer of 1999. &#8220;It was hard, hard work but it was fun.&#8221; Two hundred people were hired that summer and Silva was part of the team at Stevenson College. Their assignment was to get all the rooms cleaned before the first of three groups of high school cheerleaders arrived for summer camp. When they finished, they moved to Rachel Carson College. At the end of the summer Silva was hired as a permanent member of the custodial staff working at Rachel Carson.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the school year, 25 people keep the dorms and apartments clean in Porter, Rachel Carson, Oakes, Graduate Student Housing, Camper Park, Baskin/E-2, and Science Library. In the summer they also clean the apartments in Kresge and Redwood Grove. Two other teams work in the housing units on the eastside and central campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a year, Silva moved to Oakes College where she worked for the next 20 years cleaning the E dorm at Bico House. In 2020, she went back to Rachel Carson right before the pandemic started.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silva often volunteers when people are needed on the weekend. She says buildings have to be kept clean even when there&#8217;s a staff shortage so she&#8217;s happy to pitch in. And during the wildfire in 2020, Silva joined other UCSC employees as volunteers at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk helping people affected by the fire. &#8220;We made lots of lunches and gave them out.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things Silva likes most about UC Santa Cruz is all the nature and beauty. The Arboretum is one of her favorite places and also the East Field where she can look out and see the ocean. When she isn&#8217;t working on a weekend, she still gets up early and heads to Pinto Lake with her dog to enjoy the quiet. &#8220;It&#8217;s like here, a lot of nature. I take a walk then go home and drink my coffee.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silva is happy that this fall quarter things will go back to the way they were before the pandemic started. &#8220;Right now it&#8217;s a little better, but it&#8217;s still here.&#8221; So she continues to take precautions and puts on a facemask each morning because the most important thing is to keep her family healthy and COVID-free.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c75608e8807270462f31501785036d31"><name>arts-convocation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Arts convocation celebrates the courage to create and the audacity to imagine new worlds</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz alumnus Rick Carter, a two-time Academy Award winning film production designer and art director, returned to his alma mater on September 28th to receive the Distinguished Banana Slug Award at the second annual Arts Convocation.</summary><start-date>1665471600000</start-date><path>/2022/10/arts-convocation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/arts-convocation</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1665496647878</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1665496647878</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Nina Sazevich</name><title></title><phone/><email>nina@sazevichpr.com</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/unnamed.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/unnamed.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>unnamed.jpg</name><display-name>unnamed.jpg</display-name><file-size>23414</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/cartercelinethumb.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/cartercelinethumb.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>cartercelinethumb.jpeg</name><display-name>cartercelinethumb.jpeg</display-name><file-size>5996</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu presented </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Distinguished Banana Slug Award to two-time Academy Award winning alumnus Rick Carter at the Arts Convocation.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carter (B.A., Art, &#8216;74) received an Oscar in 2013 for his haunting production design for Steven Spielberg&#8217;s critically acclaimed cinematic masterwork </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lincoln</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as for art direction on James Cameron&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avatar. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also nominated for his work on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forrest Gump</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">War Horse</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and has numerous nominations of other awards for his work on such films as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amistad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.I. Artificial Intelligence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other notable films include </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jurassic Park</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to the Future Part II</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part III</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Carter&#8217;s student days at UCSC were spent painting, something he still avidly pursues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a lively, onstage, multigenerational conversation with undergraduate student of Art Becky Diaz and Music Professor and Associate Dean of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Karlton Hestor, Carter candidly reflected on the profound journey of personal and creative discovery he experienced as a student at UCSC and its enduring influence on his artistic process and the course of his career. Carter underscored the importance of embracing the new and the untried. &#8220;While I was at UCSC, I went in multiple directions at the same time. Even though it was confusing, I began to understand that in this fragmentation, I was learning about what I wanted to bring out into the world. It wasn&#8217;t refined yet, but my experiences were like little grains of sand that went into my consciousness like an oyster, turning them into pearls, that I return to now. Don&#8217;t be fearful of having too many versions of yourself. UCSC aids and abets that! Try things on!&#8221; he said. Asked by Diaz if there were challenges transitioning from painting to art direction, Carter responded, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know the skills yet, but I knew about the process. I know what it is to begin with a blank canvas. You learn the beginnings of your process here at UCSC.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carter conjectured that the painting-based art practice he developed at UCSC likely contributed to his lifelong, working relationship with Steven Spielberg&#8211;one that began with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goonies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1985. In a congratulatory video shown at the Convocation, Spielberg called Carter, &#8220;the artist in residence of my career.&#8221; Filmmaker J.J. Abrams likewise wished his colleague well, saying, &#8220;You are a real dreamer with the ability to make connections that transform and enlighten.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting Carter with a bronze banana slug statuette created and cast at UCSC&#8217;s foundry by J. Gaston, Shimizu noted that Carter&#8217;s career, &#8220;...shows us how to create worlds previously unseen, unheard, unfelt.&#8221; She expanded on this sentiment in her address as she encouraged students to, &#8220;...imagine new institutions that do not yet exist.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shimizu has championed diversity, equity, and inclusion in her work at UCSC and rallied students at the event to embrace the art of change. &#8220;Only by feeling for each other, caring about all of our rights, will we actualize a world where we remake social norms of exclusion and inequality,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And through your learning, you will become artists, scholars, and more, convincing others by touching them so deeply that the world must be better, that the mind must become decolonized, new sounds must be made, and new imaginations unleashed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In opening remarks, Lori Kletzer, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, noted Shimizu&#8217;s bold leadership on advancing equity in the Arts Division and the accomplishments of her first year. &#8220;In as short as a year, Dean Celine, with her steadfast and never wavering commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, has developed a strong infrastructure that will transform the Arts Division and will be the absolute centerplace of leading the university towards the same goals.&#8221; Kletzer specifically cited major grants Shimizu secured to advance faculty diversity and to forge new pathways to the professoriate. Kletzer emphasized, &#8220;These efforts will make deep and sustainable differences and embody our commitment to a faculty and student body that looks like the world we live in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest of honor Carter, who traveled the globe extensively before arriving at UCSC, also emphasized the importance of diversity to his work and the many portraits he paints of the faces he encountered along the way. &#8220;These connections with other people are also the grains of sand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve spent a lifetime developing these faces. I don&#8217;t know what my world would be without them.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diaz and Hestor engaged Carter in a deeper conversation about diversity, equity, and inclusion during their onstage chat, with Diaz wondering how she would fit in on a set as a Latina. Carter, who has unusual vision issues, replied, &#8220;Sometimes those things that you look at as being an impediment can actually be the thing that makes you not just different, but able to answer something in a new way.&#8221; He cited as an example his inability to see in 3D while working on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avatar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and how, after initially assuming he shouldn&#8217;t participate in those creative discussions, he came to understand that he could contribute significantly by bringing a different perspective to the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shimizu noted that she first met Carter earlier this year at the El Segundo Museum of Art where he is currently working with a diverse group of next generation artists on an ongoing, collaborative exhibition. &#8220;They are collaborating across generations and across difference to create new unifying grammars, structures, and vocabularies of creative expression. The project captures so well the multigenerational conversations beyond the written and spoken that we engage in here at UCSC so passionately in ways Rick Carter truly exemplifies.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students in attendance were thrilled to have the opportunity to ask Carter questions at the end of the Convocation, as many of his personal reflections about developing his art process resonated deeply. A number stayed afterwards to talk further with him, and Carter enthusiastically obliged, staying long into the day to speak with each individually and pose for numerous selfies.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c830a9c2807270462f315017cc06510c"><name>daca-message-of-support</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Supporting our undocumented and DACAmented community members</title><summary>In response to a recent court decision about DACA, Vice Chancellors Akirah Bradley-Armstrong and Anju Reejhsinghani share an important message with the campus community: UC Santa Cruz is fully committed to supporting undocumented and DACAmented community members. </summary><start-date>1665471600000</start-date><display-name>Supporting our undocumented and DACAmented community members</display-name><path>/2022/10/daca-message-of-support</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/daca-message-of-support</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1665510975918</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1665512060697</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Campus Community,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are deeply troubled by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recent ruling affirming that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program violates federal law.&#160; The decision creates ongoing&#160; uncertainties for hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients, including members of our UC Santa Cruz community. We are profoundly disappointed by the decision&#8217;s potential impact and are writing to extend our reassurances to all impacted.</span></p>
<p><strong>Undocumented and DACAmented students can enroll and stay enrolled at UC Santa Cruz. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of this unsettling decision and what may eventually come of it, we are dedicated to ensuring that all students have equal access to a UC Santa Cruz education. While guided by </span><a href="https://diversity.ucsc.edu/resources/ab21page.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assembly Bill 21 (AB21)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/Statement-of-Principles-in-Support-of-Undocumented-Members-of-UC.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Statement of Principles of Undocumented Members of the UC Community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we make this steadfast commitment to our students because it is the right thing to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fulbright HSI Leader status has been conferred on 43 HSIs for demonstrating noteworthy engagement with Fulbright exchange participants during the 2021-2022 academic year and promoting </span><a href="http://eca.state.gov/fulbright"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fulbright Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opportunities on campus. The Fulbright Program offers international educational and cultural exchange programs for passionate and accomplished students, scholars, artists, teachers, and professionals of all backgrounds to study, teach, or pursue important research and professional projects.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2021-22 academic year, UC Santa Cruz hosted 11 graduate students and faculty who were Fulbrighters and UC Santa Cruz has more than 30 faculty members who have received a Fulbright award.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am thrilled and honored that our campus is once again recognized as a Fulbright HSI Leader,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;The program itself celebrates diversity and inclusivity, and is a key component of our campus internationalization plan. It&#8217;s an avenue for visiting scholars, artists and researchers who bring a high degree of expertise and global perspectives, both of which are essential for a public research university. It also opens up the world to our students.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In support of a campus wide effort to build and strengthen worldwide partnerships, UC Santa Cruz is </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/international-plan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">implementing a new strategic plan for internationalization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ensure that the members of the campus community &#8212; students, faculty, and staff &#8212; are prepared and encouraged to study, teach, conduct research, and work in a global context, and that institutional policies, programs, and initiatives are aligned to achieve this shared goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fullbright honor comes just weeks after UC Santa Cruz </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/seal-of-excelencia.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earned the Seal of Excelencia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, recognition of intentional campuswide efforts to serve Latinx students. UC Santa Cruz was one of six institutions that earned the Seal of Excelencia for the first time this year. The only other University of California campuses that have earned the seal are UC Riverside and UC Merced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To advance efforts to increase opportunities for those historically underserved by higher education, UC Santa Cruz earlier this year </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/alliance-hispanic-serving-research-universities.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined other leading universities to form the Alliance of Hispanic Serving Research Universities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A coalition of 21 research universities, the alliance is working to double the number of Latinx doctoral students enrolled at member universities and increase by 20% the Latinx professoriate in member universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Academic Programs Ethan Rosenzweig, speaking on behalf of ECA, which sponsors the Fulbright Program, announced the Fulbright HSI Leaders on October 10 during an international plenary session at the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) annual conference in San Diego.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rosenzweig thanked HSI leaders for their collaboration and for recognizing the value of the Fulbright Program in deepening campus internationalization efforts; and he recognized Fulbright campus liaisons and advisors for recruiting and advising applicants.&#160; He also commended current Fulbright participants and alumni from and hosted by HSIs for sharing &#8220;their expertise, experience, perspective, and enthusiasm with their institutions, their communities, and their societies.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On November 7, a Fulbright HSI Virtual Workshop will feature representatives of Fulbright HSI Leaders sharing best practices for HSIs to leverage Fulbright Program engagement to support students and faculty, increase campus internationalization, and build global networks. This virtual event is open to the public and while all are welcome, the session is specifically designed for HSI faculty, staff, and stakeholders. Institutions can </span><a href="https://apply.iie.org/register/HSIWorkshop2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sign up online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fulbright Program is the U.S. government's flagship international academic exchange program. Since its inception over 75 years ago, the Fulbright Program has given over 400,000 talented and accomplished students, scholars, teachers, artists, and professionals of all backgrounds and fields the opportunity to study, teach, and conduct research abroad, exchanging ideas, and contributing to finding solutions to complex international challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year, the U.S. Congress appropriates funds to the U.S. Department of State to sponsor the Fulbright Program. Many foreign governments contribute substantially as well. Additional funding and in-kind funding is provided by U.S. and foreign host institutions, non-governmental organizations, private organizations, corporate partnerships, and individual donors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over many years the Fulbright Program has designed and implemented a wide range of initiatives to increase participant diversity and inclusion. The program strives to ensure that its participants reflect the diversity of U.S. society and societies abroad. Fulbrighters come from all backgrounds and are selected through an open, merit-based competition, regardless of their race, color, national origin, sex, age, religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c90ae249807270462f3150171c9495f4"><name>olivia-silva-profile-spanish</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Perfil de Olivia Silva – Servicios de Limpieza</title><summary>Por primera vez en casi dos años las residencias estarán llenas de estudiantes y eso significa el regreso a la normalidad para Olivia Silva.</summary><start-date>1665471600000</start-date><path>/2022/10/olivia-silva-profile-spanish</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/olivia-silva-profile-spanish</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1665525277236</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1665525632887</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Sandra Messick</name><title></title><phone/><email>sgmessic@ucsc.ed.u</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/silvatn.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/silvatn.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>silvatn.jpeg</name><display-name>silvatn.jpeg</display-name><file-size>46489</file-size><width>512</width><height>512</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Por primera vez en casi dos a&#241;os las residencias estar&#225;n llenas de estudiantes y eso significa el regreso a la normalidad para Olivia Silva. As&#237; como para unos 140 miembros del personal del Servicio de Limpieza y de Comedores, Silva fue una de los muchos trabajadores </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in situ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">que desempe&#241;aron un papel cr&#237;tico en la respuesta del campus al COVID-19. Ellos continuaron viniendo al campus para hacer frente al aumento en la demanda de limpieza por dondequiera, despu&#233;s de que la universidad enviara a casa a los estudiantes y al personal para que siguieran aprendiendo y trabajando.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Trabajamos muy duro todos los d&#237;as, mayormente en los Colegios 9 y 10 ya que all&#237; quedaron viviendo hab&#237;a algunos estudiantes, estudiantes internacionales que no pod&#237;an irse a casa. Nuestro trabajo pas&#243; hacia all&#225; para atenderlos durante un a&#241;o. Fue algo aterrador y a veces deprimente pero gracias a Dios aqu&#237; estamos ahora&#8221;, dijo Silva.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su mayor temor era enfermarse y exponer a su familia al virus. &#8220;Yo estaba preocupada. Andaba todo el d&#237;a con la mascarilla puesta en el trabajo y me cercioraba de mantenerme a distancia de todos. Mantener a mi familia segura era muy importante&#8221;. Como su esposo tambi&#233;n era un empleado esencial, durante la semana el hijo y la hija de ellos se quedaban solos en casa asistiendo a la escuela en l&#237;nea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">En los &#250;ltimos 23 a&#241;os, Silva ha formado parte del equipo de limpieza de la universidad, manteniendo limpias y seguras las residencias del sector oeste del campus. Por razones personales, eso es muy importante para ella. &#8220;Quiero hacer lo mejor que puedo. Trato de mantener seguros a los estudiantes. Pienso que si mi hija e hijo asistieran a la universidad, yo quisiera que todo all&#237; estuviese limpio&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cada ma&#241;ana, Silva empieza a trabajar a las 7:30, con cinco minutos de estiramiento a fin de preparar el cuerpo para el trabajo que tiene por delante. Despu&#233;s de entrar en calor, Silva re&#250;ne sus aperos, se pone las gafas de protecci&#243;n, guantes y mascarilla, recoge sus suministros y parte rumbo a los dormitorios del Jard&#237;n C y el D, en el cuadrante inferior del Colegio Rachel Carson. Ella es una de seis personas asignadas a ese colegio. Silva limpia las &#225;reas p&#250;blicas, tales como entradas, pasillos, escaleras, ba&#241;os y ventanas &#8211; dentro y fuera &#8211; as&#237; como los cuartos de lavander&#237;a, incluso dentro de las m&#225;quinas. Ella se siente orgullosa de su trabajo y los estudiantes se dan cuenta de ello. &#8220;Algunos estudiantes me dicen &#8216;muchas gracias por su af&#225;n en el trabajo&#8217;. A veces me hacen regalos en el verano y en Navidad &#8211; flores, tarjetas o tarjetas de regalo. Hay veces que me ponen una notita en mi taquilla, dici&#233;ndome &#8216;Gracias por su af&#225;n. Usted es como si fuera mi mam&#225;&#8217;&#8221;.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Es una labor agotadora, sobre todo en los meses de verano cuando las cuadrillas efect&#250;an lo que se llama la primera limpieza &#8211; una limpieza profunda de cada habitaci&#243;n en los dormitorios y apartamentos por todo el campus al final a&#241;o acad&#233;mico. Ellos tambi&#233;n preparan las habitaciones para el verano. &#8220;Hay grupos que vienen a las conferencias y programas de verano, y mantenemos los cuartos limpios mientras est&#225;n aqu&#237;&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silva comenz&#243; a trabajar en la UC Santa Cruz en el verano de 1999. &#8220;Era un trabajo duro, duro pero divertido&#8221;. Ese verano fueron contratadas doscientas personas y Silva formaba parte del equipo en el Colegio Stevenson. Les asignaron limpiar todas las habitaciones antes de que el primero de tres grupos de porristas de secundaria llegase para un campamento de verano. Al terminar, pasaron al Colegio Rachel Carson. Al final del verano a Silva la contrataron para trabajar como miembro permanente del personal de limpieza en Rachel Carson.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cd1059198072704667a8150a5fe3d041"><name>kim-acs-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Biomolecular engineering professor wins American Cancer Society award to develop technology for cancer early detection</title><summary>Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Daniel Kim won a four-year, $792,000 Research Scholar award from the American Cancer Society to support his work in developing RNA liquid biopsy technology to diagnose cancer early on.&#13;

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, a four-year, $792,000 Research Scholar award from the American Cancer Society will support his work in developing RNA liquid biopsy technology to diagnose cancer early on.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/07/kim-cell-reports.html">Kim&#8217;s lab has discovered</a></span><span class="s1"> that certain cancers in their early stages release RNA &#8220;dark matter&#8221; into the blood as a result of key mutations to those genes which have the potential to drive cells into a cancerous state. Searching the blood for these secreted RNAs, which include several different types of &#8220;noncoding&#8221; RNA, is the crux of this novel liquid biopsy technology.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I'm very excited to join the American Cancer Society family as a Research Scholar, and it's an honor to be part of this amazing community that's saving lives and leading the fight for a world without cancer,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;Through the generous support of the American Cancer Society, we'll be developing technology that will hopefully save many lives in the future by diagnosing cancer before it has spread throughout the body."</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Liquid biopsies are a minimally invasive method of diagnosing cancer, as compared to a traditional, more invasive tumor tissue biopsy. Most liquid biopsy approaches currently focus on DNA molecules that circulate in the blood, but Kim&#8217;s research is uncovering the vast potential of RNA as a diagnostic biomarker of cancer and other diseases.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Kim lab is part of the Baskin School of Engineering, the Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells, the Genomics Institute, the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA, and affiliated with the Canary Center at Stanford for Cancer Early Detection.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We are very grateful to the American Cancer Society, as well as all of our fantastic colleagues and wonderful collaborators who have helped us advance our efforts to develop RNA liquid biopsy technology for cancer early detection,&#8221;

<p>Kendall-Bar, now a Scripps Postdoctoral Scholar at UC San Diego, is the top winner in the &#8220;Research Scientist: Graduate Student&#8221; category for her work at UC Santa Cruz on data visualization tools and animations to help scientists communicate their findings. P&#233;rez Ortega, a bilingual science journalist based in Mexico City, was recognized as a winner in the &#8220;Science Journalist: Early Career&#8221; category for his work as a staff writer at <em>Science</em> magazine.</p>
<p>The announcement of the awards from the National Academies said that &#8220;Kendall-Bar&#8217;s range of beautiful, relatable work utilizes impressive, innovative tools and platforms that can be used to further the cause of science communication into the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>The projects recognized by this award include Kendall-Bar&#8217;s work with several different research labs at UC Santa Cruz using data visualization tools to transform animal tracking data into cinematic and informative animations of marine mammal behavior (see &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/OcU-LKWKL3A">Visualizing Life in the Deep</a>&#8221;). In her thesis research on the <a href="https://youtu.be/yBRX8cNmNoQ">sleep patterns of seals</a>, she worked with Daniel Costa and Terrie Williams, both professors of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>She was also recognized for her work with the <a href="https://www.coastalresiliencelab.org/">UCSC Coastal Resilience Lab</a> to develop graphics supporting research on the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/coral-reefs.html">coastal protection benefits of coral reefs</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.coastalresiliencelab.org/">data visualization portal</a> for exploring the coastal protection benefits of mangroves.</p>
<p>In addition to her own research, Kendall-Bar helped teach workshops and courses on data visualization at UCSC, and she created an <a href="mailto:https://www.jessiekb.com/artforscicomm">online learning center</a> as a resource for scientists interested in using graphic design, animation, and other visual communication tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;The news of this award came after hearing that our research trip to was cancelled due to poor sea ice conditions&#8212;a silver lining amidst discouraging news, telling us that it is more important now than ever to tell stories that protect the planet,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As a staff writer at <em>Science</em>, P&#233;rez Ortega focuses on diversity in science. He is also editorial director of <em>The Open Notebook</em> en Espa&#241;ol. He covers life sciences, medicine, health, policy, and academia, and his work has appeared in the <em>New York Times, Nature, Science News,</em> <em>Knowable</em>, and other media outlets. After studying biomedical sciences with a focus on neuroscience at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, he earned a master&#8217;s degree in the UCSC <a href="https://scicom.ucsc.edu/">Science Communication Program</a>. &#160;He is a founding member of the Mexican Network of Science Journalists and serves on the board of the National Association of Science Writers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This award recognizes my work as the first-ever diversity reporter at <em>Science</em> magazine, and it&#8217;s a big step to make science a more inclusive endeavor,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 25, at 7 p.m., Aptheker will read from this book at the Cowell Ranch Hay Barn near the base of campus, and take part in a discussion focusing on her life of adventurous activism. The event is presented by The Humanities Institute at UCSC and Bookshop Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event is free and open to the public but seating is limited so advance registration is required. </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesNFSjPXIKw1MBc0dKqWrYQYvQoCaoe9bB8iKSSZy8CpoT-g/viewform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up here to reserve your spot.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mask-wearing is mandatory for this event.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder describes Aptheker as &#8220;one of the leading feminist scholars, recognized for building the Feminist Studies program at UCSC. But she is also a master storyteller and a great communicator who works across disciplines. In her classes she would draw not just from scholarship but from art, poetry, videos, and music.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Her books, like her classes, are a testament to the fact that the personal is political,&#8221; Alinder said. &#8220;In the past few years that&#8217;s become an academic catchphrase, but Aptheker pioneered this way of thinking. Her books are more than just portraits of historic periods. They also talk about the human impact&#8212;what it is like to put your life on the line for what you believe.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>A history of exclusion, defiance, and bravery</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptheker&#8217;s book covers the fraught and complex history of LGBT people in the Communist Party, which banned them from membership starting in 1938, and even cast them off as &#8220;degenerates.&#8221;&#160; In fact the exclusionary policy lasted until 1991 when the Party split after the Soviet Union collapsed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the ban that lasted for six decades, the gays and lesbians who supported the party had to stay in the closet. To contemporary readers, such exclusionary practices may seem surprising or even shocking, considering&#160; the party&#8217;s groundswell of popularity&#8212;it had close to 100,000 members by the 1930s&#8212;and because of its embrace of causes strongly associated with progressive politics including anti-racist organizing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gays and lesbians were very closeted in general in the 1930s and 1940s, and certainly closeted within the Communist Party during the six decades in which they were banned from membership, Aptheker said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there were important complications that added depth and nuance to this story.&#160; For instance, the Communist Party, in spite of its homophobic stance, had members who were brave enough to stand up for lesbian and gay liberation, defying the homophobic status quo. In the process, those leaders contributed to the political and philosophical underpinnings of those movements.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptheker started</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> working in archives to research </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communists in Closets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2010 during her one-year sabbatical. &#8220;In the course of the decade I continued archival work whenever I had a break from teaching,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptheker also drew freely from her own memories. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because I had been closeted myself in the Communist Party in the 1960s and &#8216;70s, I had some ideas about who and what to look for in my research,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;A desire for freedom&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book is newly released but it&#8217;s already receiving warm praise from distinguished scholars and authors such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah Schulman, author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let the Record Show: A History of ACT UP New York, 1987&#8211;1993 </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2021).&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bettina Aptheker's personal history of gay and lesbian people and the Communist Party is essential and transformative in enlightening our understanding of gay, Black, and women's liberation visions in America,&#8221; Schulman writes. &#8220;She shows how queer desires for freedom were so expansive that they were propelled by both the party's political visions of justice and the cruelties of its organizational prejudices to create entirely new liberation formations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aptheker traces the invention of Gay Liberation in America, the first Women's Studies class, the founding of Parents of gays solidarity organizations, lesbian music, and the first play by a Black woman on Broadway&#8212;all sprouting from queer Communist origins,&#8221; Schulman continues. &#8220;This is a book that makes connections and fills gaps, defies stigma, and defies historical silence.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Helen Washington, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distinguished University Professor of English at the University of Maryland, College Park, and author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Other Blacklist: The African American Literary and Cultural Left of the 1950s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, called the book &#8220;at once a deeply personal portrait of Bettina Aptheker and her struggles as a gay woman in the Communist movement, but also a generous, appreciative and carefully historicized portrait of the many others who were gay, feminist, and Communist. The chapter on Lorraine Hansberry is especially enriched by Aptheker&#8217;s triple vision."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptheker is also the author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intimate Politics: How I Grew Up Red</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fought for Free Speech and Became A Feminist Rebel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2006); and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Morning Breaks: The Trial of Angela Davis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1976; second edition 1999).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptheker, who received her Ph.D. in History of Consciousness from UC Santa Cruz, has been honored with the Award for Excellence in Education by the California chapter of the National Organization for Women. She was recently named a prestigious University of California Presidential Chair in Feminist Critical Race and Ethnic Studies at UC Santa Cruz, and is currently teaching an online course on feminism and social justice.</span></p>

The destruction of this important symbol of Mexican and Chicanx culture is disgraceful and abhorrent. Acts like these attempt to inspire fear, make some members of our community feel like they don&#8217;t belong, and slow our work by pulling us out of community with one another and undermining our shared values. It is so important that we not give in to those who seek to divide us.</span></p>
<p><span>We say unequivocally to our Mexican, Chicanx, and Latinx students and community members: You belong here at UC Santa Cruz. The destruction of the flag was heinous and unacceptable. We are investigating this crime and will hold those responsible for this accountable.</span></p>
<p><span>Many in our community have shared that they do not feel that the university has acted on this issue. We want to assure you that we always take situations like this seriously. A lack of public notice does not reflect whether an investigation has begun or whether support has been provided to those directly impacted. Part of processes like these may entail upholding the confidentiality of those who report such incidents, and we ask you to respect that privacy. We want all of our community members to feel confident reporting incidents. Know that we strive to handle these issues immediately and with the care and gravity that such situations require.</span></p>
<p><span>We&#8217;re unlikely to prevent all bad actors from engaging in hateful acts or speech in the future. But we can take this opportunity to defy those who would divide us, to lift up and support those who have been harmed, and to recognize that the good work we do together is bigger than any attempt to tear us apart.</span></p>

Recognizing the need for anti-racist technology that takes into consideration the perceptions and experiences of underrepresented populations, the UC Santa Cruz Baskin School of Engineering established the Fellowship for Anti-Racism Research (FARR) in 2021.</p>
<p>Graduate students Roman Reggiardo and Milad Hakimshafaei are the latest fellows carrying out individual projects to research tools and techniques that will combat discrimination and racism in technology and engineering.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea for FARR emerged as we engaged in long, overdue discussions of how, as a school, Baskin Engineering can actively contribute to building a more just and anti-racist society,&#8221; said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;FARR is one of a number of important school-wide initiatives that came out of those discussions, which also included the formation of the Baskin Inclusive Curriculum and Engineering Pedagogy (BICEP) initiative, active participation in designing the campus Faculty Equity Advocates program, and the appointment of Applied Mathematics Associate Professor Marcella Gomez as the school's first associate dean for diversity, equity, and inclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Eliminating discrimination for equitable medical technologies</strong></p>
<p>Inherent bias has long been prevalent in genetic analysis technologies. As new medical technology is developed, it is imperative that adequate representation of diverse patient characteristics, including sex, race, and ethnicity, is accounted for early in the design process to ensure that products are effective, accessible, and equitable for all.</p>
<p>Machine learning tools play an increasingly important role in analyzing patient data, such as blood samples. These tools can inherit the bias of their technologists and can ultimately affect diagnoses.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have tons of opportunities to accrue and encounter bias that may never be addressed,&#8221; said biomolecular engineering Ph.D. student Roman Reggiardo. &#8220;If we build a diagnostic tool that only works on one population, then we lose the opportunity to make the impact that we&#8217;re after. I wanted to investigate the current efforts to make diagnostics and liquid biopsies more equitable and how we can adjust things further to make it all unbiased moving forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>With mentorship from his faculty advisor Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Daniel Kim, Reggiardo is investigating the barriers to accessible and fair liquid biopsy diagnostics, a type of medical technology that uses cutting-edge DNA or RNA genetic sequencing to derive a complex diagnosis from a single blood draw.&#160;</p>
<p>Reggiardo, who started his fellowship late summer 2022, is reviewing recent studies to assess patient populations and the potential biasing of early results from liquid biopsies. His aim is to both quantitatively and qualitatively assess the shortcomings of diagnostic performance and relevance across diverse populations. He then hopes to address these issues through new methodologies that draw from data representing a diverse population in order to develop technologies and computational tools that aid in fair and ethical practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;My thesis research is directly tied to how liquid biopsy technology can be equitably developed, deployed, and used,&#8221; Reggiardo said.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Expanding diverse perceptions in visual design</strong></p>
<p>Text-to-image artificial intelligence (AI) generators&#8212;systems that create images and patterns from written text descriptions&#8212;are becoming increasingly popular and are used for a wide range of content creation applications.&#160;</p>
<p>Computational media Ph.D. student Milad Hakimshafaei is interested in using an AI system that generates visual images and patterns to collect information about perception and the aesthetic preferences of diverse populations to better understand and engineer more inclusive computational tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;As someone who came to the United States from the Middle East, I noticed the differences in lifestyle, access to technology, and opportunities to shape our future as humans,&#8221; Hakimshafaei said. &#8220;These experiences motivated me to get involved in research that highlights and addresses the areas of technology that need to be improved to be more inclusive.&#8221;</p>
<p>With mentorship from&#160;UCSC Open Source Program Office (OSPO) Incubator Fellow and PolyPhy Project Lead Oskar Elek and Stephanie Lieggi, executive director for OSPO and the Center for Research in Open Source Software, Hakimshafaei will develop an interface built off of an existing web-based AI generator that will allow the end user to control the system&#8217;s behavior to generate interesting and unique patterns. By studying a broad array of users&#8217; visual design aesthetic preferences, he plans to develop algorithms that better represent the experience of beauty for different people.&#160;</p>
<p>Through this fellowship, Hakimshafaei hopes to draw attention to the value of including a diverse representation of users in software development and the importance of open-source communities for sharing ideas and collaborating on projects to produce unbiased, anti-racist technology.&#160;</p>
<p>Both Reggiardo and Hakimshafaei will present their research findings during the 25th anniversary of the Baskin School of Engineering, which will be celebrated throughout the 2022&#8211;23 academic year. FARR is open to all declared Baskin Engineering undergraduate and graduate students, including undergraduates pursuing engineering minors.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest day for fundraising at UC Santa Cruz returns to campus on November 2. The seventh annual Giving Day will raise funds for student success&#8212;with an emphasis on programs that provide access to financial support, secure sources for basic needs, mental health support, opportunities to participate in cutting-edge research, and connections that catalyze social mobility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more than 150 Giving Day projects this year that will help ensure Banana Slugs have access to all that UC Santa Cruz has to offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Giving Day is wildly popular at UC Santa Cruz because it makes a significant impact on campus, and donors can see </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exactly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where their gifts are going,&#8221; says Jenna Hurley, associate director of annual giving. &#8220;Teams are raising money for projects that directly benefit students and amplify their UCSC experience. Things like sports equipment, lab materials, travel costs for clubs, basic needs like food and housing, peer mentorship support, career and community building opportunities, and extracurricular activities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students, faculty, staff, parents, friends, and alumni are encouraged to support UCSC during the 24-hour online crowdfunding contest. A series of time-based challenges will award teams prizes for the most donors, the best social media presence, the most compelling videos, and more. Giving Day donors can compete with one another to propel their favorite projects into first place for these challenges, or have their gifts doubled by generous matching donors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz Board of Trustees are among those providing a challenge by generously funding the Slug Power Challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Challenges and matches buoy participation and enthusiasm for Giving Day,&#8221; Hurley says. &#8220;We&#8217;re really inspired by the incredible buy-in and engagement from campus leadership.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Engaging alumni</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, 3,610 donors generously contributed more than $700,000 during Giving Day. Alumni accounted for 41 percent of those donors. Hurley says the fundraising event is a great way for alumni to support their alma mater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Giving Day is a fantastic opportunity for alumni to give back and provide today&#8217;s Banana Slugs with the same opportunities and more than they had during their time at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We encourage gifts of all sizes&#8212;even a gift of $5 makes a difference.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Giving Day supports student success</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Day projects amplify student experiences at UC Santa Cruz. Examples&#160; of these student-centered projects include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Academic Excellence (ACE) Program increases diversity and reduces the achievement gap for historically underrepresented students majoring in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Giving Day helps ACE serve more students.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) is the world's largest international synthetic biology competition. UCSC's 2022 iGEM team will use funds from Giving Day to pay for&#160; lab materials so the team can conduct their research project, as well as registration fees and travel expenses associated with the competition.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The College Scholars Program at UC Santa Cruz (CSP) provides opportunities for highly-motivated students to build community and participate in research during their first four quarters at UCSC. Giving Day funds provide&#160; academic and non-academic seminars, workshops, and career and community building opportunities.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Everett Program&#8217;s Gateways Project is a network of student projects centered on reducing recidivism across California correctional facilities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gateways students are partnering with formerly incarcerated filmmaker Thanh Tran to help produce Finding Ma, a documentary focused on his experiences with the foster system, incarceration, and family reunification. Contributions from giving day will allow students to purchase necessary software and equipment to support this independent documentary in its beginning stages.&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Get ready. Get set. Give.</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz community&#8212;students, alumni, staff, families, faculty, and friends&#8212;will have the chance to support these programs and others when Giving Day 2022 kicks off at 12 a.m. on November 2 all the way until 11:59 p.m. The </span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Day website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will provide up-to-the-moment tallies.</span></p>

Celebrating 50 years of Grupo Folklorico Los Mejicas de UC Santa Cruz</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Leticia Quezada arrived at UC Santa Cruz in 1971, she was one of 300 Latino students among a student body of about 4,000. Separated from her culture and community, Quezada felt isolated and alone but determined to establish roots. She joined forces with fellow student, Juan Rios, and together they launched a Ballet Folklorico group to create community and a self-described &#8220;home away from home&#8221; for themselves. Little did they know that they were building a long-lasting legacy for future Banana Slugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifty years later, </span><a href="https://losmejicas.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grupo Folkl&#243;rico Los Mejicas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the oldest campus organizations at UC Santa Cruz, continues to thrive as a student-run group, and reigns as the first Ballet Folklorico in the UC system. Dedicated to teaching and performing the regional music, dances, and traditions of Mexico, Los Mejicas fosters an appreciation for the beauty and diversity of Mexican culture.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We didn&#8217;t want it to be a dance group just for the sake of dance,&#8221; Quezada says. &#8220;The real purpose of Los Mejicas was to have Chicano students have somewhere they could feel welcome&#8212;among friends&#8212;that would remind them of their culture. I am so proud that our original intent is still an integral part of the group.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, many of Quezada and Rios&#8217;s founding principles remain woven into the fabric of Los Mejicas. The group is open to all students from any ethnic origin and academic discipline&#8212;members do not need to be Chicanx nor a dance or arts-related major.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hundreds of students have participated in Los Mejicas since its inception, many of whom are second and even third-generation members. This legacy of involvement is often a reason students choose UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Quezada says. &#8220;The group has a saying, &#8216;Once a Mejica, always a Mejica.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quezada is proud that Los Mejicas has impacted students in ways far beyond steps and choreography. According to the group&#8217;s </span><a href="https://crowdfund.ucsc.edu/project/32883?clid=fbUMpWHmPOKP6bUZJLRnCI&amp;utm_campaign=site_share&amp;utm_medium=plain&amp;utm_source=scalefunder#Los%20Mejicas%20Crowdfund%20Page"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crowdfunding page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, &#8220;The relationships, cultural histories, sense of belonging, and contribution to our respective fields of study have been directly impacted by Mejicas.&#8221; The group is raising funds for costumes, travel expenses, and maestros (instructors), in order to continue the tradition for future generations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz has evolved since Quezada&#8217;s early experience. Today, more than one-quarter of the 17,000 student body are Chicanx/Latinx, and there are over 16,000 Latinx alumni. The campus is a Hispanic Serving Institution, is a founding member of the </span><a href="https://www.hsru.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance of Hispanic Serving Research Universities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and most recently was awarded the prestigious </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/seal-of-excelencia.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seal of Excelencia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in recognition of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s intentional campus-wide efforts to serve Latinx students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the progress that has been made, &#8220;the need we were addressing in 1972 still exists,&#8221; says Quezada. &#8220;We want Los Mejicas to have a solid base. We want to ensure that funding is there year to year. What do we need to do and organize as alumni to provide a foundation that will remain at UC Santa Cruz for fifty more years.&#8221;</span></p>

</ul></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California Office of the President invites comments on the proposed updates to the existing Presidential Policy on Sustainable Practices. The proposed revisions address the following key issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green Building Design: The first two updates to this policy section codify campus best practices and respond to comments from the systemwide review of last year&#8217;s updates to the Sustainable Practices Policy and to requests from several Regents. The first update raises the minimum green building certification level for new buildings from LEED Silver to LEED Gold. The second update addresses the fact that parking structures are no longer eligible to earn LEED certification by requiring new parking structures to achieve a Parksmart Silver certification. Parksmart is a rating system similar to LEED that is designed for parking structures and has already been piloted on two UC campuses. The third update to this section removed references to the Savings by Design Program that California&#8217;s investor-owned utility companies recently discontinued.</li>
<li>Climate Protection: The date that campuses will achieve carbon neutrality from scope 3 sources was moved up from 2050 to 2045 to align with the State of California&#8217;s updated goal. A new provision was added to the Procedures section to integrate the University&#8217;s &#8220;Framework for Incorporating Environmental &amp; Climate Justice into Climate Action&#8221; into the climate action planning processes.</li>
<li>Zero Waste: The target dates for the foodservice-related single-use plastic requirements were postponed until July 2024 to allow time for foodservice facilities to adjust to post-pandemic operating conditions. Additionally, as campuses can no longer count incinerated waste toward their waste diversion rates, language related to that completed transition was removed.</li>
<li>Sustainable Foodservice: Consistent with comments received during the systemwide review of last year&#8217;s updates to the Sustainable Practices Policy, this update sets a new target for UC locations to procure 25% plant-based food by 2030 and strive to procure 30%. These new targets will facilitate and track efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of food served at UC locations.</li>
<li>Sustainability at UC Health: The updates to this policy section set new goals for sustainable procurement. Specifically, provisions were added to cover medical device reprocessing and the procurement of appliances, hardware, and office supplies.</li>
<li>Health and Well-Being: Drawing on research, analysis, and pilot projects led by the Global Food Initiative, Healthy Campus Network and Healthy Beverage Initiative, updates to this policy section establish targets for the percentage of beverages and food in vending machines that meet the UC Healthy Vending Guidelines. Additional provisions cover the marketing of healthy vending items, energy efficiency, and zero waste goals for vending machines.</li>
<li>Minor revisions throughout the policy remove outdated language and targets and help to clarify the intent and improve the readability of the document.</li>
</ul>
<p>The draft policy is <a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/policiesinreview/sustainable_practices_2022.pdf">available online</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Named in honor of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">visionary feminist philosopher and writer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gloria </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anzald&#250;a, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he prize is awarded for groundbreaking monographs in women's studies that make significant multicultural feminist contributions to women of color/transnational scholarship. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anzald&#250;a, a long active member of NWSA, was also </span><a href="https://www.iascollectivemuseum.com/jennifer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lecturer in the Women's Studies Department at UCSC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where she influenced a generation of students, offering such courses as</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Autohistorias </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Women of Color in the United States</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Her groundbreaking book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borderlands: La Frontera </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1987) was selected as one of the &#8220;100 Best Books of the Century&#8221; by both the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utne Reader</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hungry Mind Review.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the highest honors in Women/Gender/Feminist Studies, this is a landmark, field-transforming win!&#8221; says UCSC Arts Division Dean Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu. &#8220;micha c&#225;rdenas joins the ranks of the most distinguished feminist scholars who are expanding the field.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">c&#225;rdenas&#8217; book considers contemporary digital media, artwork, and poetry in order to articulate trans of color strategies for safety and survival. Drawing on decolonial theory, women of color feminism, media theory, and queer of color critique, c&#225;rdenas develops a method she calls algorithmic analysis. Understanding algorithms as sets of instructions designed to perform specific tasks (like a recipe), she breaks them into their component parts, called operations. By focusing on these operations, c&#225;rdenas identifies how trans and gender-non-conforming artists, especially artists of color, rewrite algorithms to counter violence and develop strategies for liberation. In her analyses of Giuseppe Campuzano's holographic art, Esdras Parra's and Kai Cheng Thom's poetry, Mattie Brice's digital games, Janelle Mon&#225;e's music videos, and her own artistic practice, c&#225;rdenas shows how algorithmic analysis provides new modes of understanding the complex processes of identity and oppression and the intersection of gender, sexuality, and race.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poetic Operations</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is arguably the first major academic work to deal with the subject matter in such detail,&#8221; writes Sofie Vlaad, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of Critical Race Inquiry.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;How c&#225;rdenas uses the term [trans of color poetics] will likely become the standard by which other engagements with the term are measured.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am humbled by this honor,&#8221; says c&#225;rdenas. &#8220;This award is the most meaningful recognition I have received in my career. Gloria Anzald&#250;a has been, and continues to be, one of my primary inspirations, as a queer Chicana feminist who blended artistic practice and scholarship. She is a large part of why I came to UCSC&#8212;to be in the place where she taught, studied, and wrote. I am honored to carry on her legacy. I hope that this award brings more attention to trans of color poetics, and helps continue to establish transgender studies as an essential part of women&#8217;s, feminist, and gender studies.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">c&#225;rdenas directs the </span><a href="https://criticalrealities.sites.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical Realities Studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at UCSC, a hybrid studio/lab for critical theory and art practice. The studio engages multiple realities in art, including augmented reality and alternate reality games, as well as other forms of art practice, to engage with the most pressing issues the world faces, including climate change, gender violence, racism and colonialism, using algorithmic and intersectional methods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">c&#225;rdenas&#8217; co-authored books </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Transreal: Political Aesthetics of Crossing Realities</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2012) and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trans Desire / Affective Cyborgs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2010) were published by Atropos Press. She is co-editor of the book series Queer/Trans/Digital at NYU Press, with Amanda Philips and Bo Ruberg. She is a first generation Colombian American.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her solo and collaborative artworks have been presented in museums, galleries, and biennials including the Thessaloniki Biennial in Greece, Arnolfini Gallery, De La Warr Pavilion in London, Museum of Modern Art in New York, Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, the Centro Cultural del Bosque in Mexico City, the Centro Cultural de Tijuana, the Zero1 Biennial, and the California Biennial. c&#225;rdenas is a member of the artist collective Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">c&#225;rdenas&#8217; newest artwork, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oceanic: Queering the Ocean</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a collaboration with UCSC professors Cynthia Ling Lee and Susana Ruiz, as well as Gerald Casel and Huy Truong, will be screening at the </span><a href="https://sftff.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco Transgender Film Festival</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on November 11, 2022.

<p>Finkelstein, an adjunct professor in the Department of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology, has done pioneering research on lead poisoning in California condors, establishing a body of scientific evidence that helped inform California&#8217;s ban on the use of lead ammunition in hunting. Condors, eagles, and other species are poisoned by ingesting bullet fragments when they feed on the remains of animals shot with lead-based ammunition.</p>
<p>Finkelstein began investigating the impacts of lead exposure on eagles several years ago, but funding for this research has been hard to come by.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know eagles are dying from lead poisoning, but we don&#8217;t have enough data to tell what effect this is having on their populations, which is important for informing management and policy decisions,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>For the current project, she teamed up with Zeka Glucs, a former graduate student in her lab who now directs the Predatory Bird Research Group (PBRG), to launch their first formal collaboration. The Webster Foundation&#8217;s gift provides funding for student interns to work with Finkelstein on the eagle project and help Glucs expand the PBRG&#8217;s peregrine falcon monitoring program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a long-standing program to monitor the peregrine falcon population throughout the Bay Area using nest cams and bird banding,&#8221; Glucs said. &#8220;This collaboration with Myra&#8217;s lab is a great and rare opportunity for students to get hands-on experience in both lab research and field research.&#8221;</p>
<p>The students will begin field research with Glucs next year. In the lab, they are just getting started on the analysis of feathers and blood samples collected from golden eagles in Montana by the Teton Raptor Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have blood samples and feathers from about 40 birds that will provide a unique data set for understanding lead exposure rates in golden eagles,&#8221; Finkelstein said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really excited, because we&#8217;ve had this project ready to go, we just needed the support to work on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She currently has six students working in her lab, including five supported by the Webster Foundation gift. Having the funds to pay student interns enables many more students to get valuable research experience, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It allows us to bring in students who wouldn&#8217;t otherwise be able to do it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Zeka and I feel strongly that it shouldn&#8217;t be just those who have the luxury to volunteer who get this career-building experience. Having the funds to support students doing lab and field-based research is important to create equal opportunities for all our undergrads at UCSC.&#8221;</p>
<p>The student researchers will get to present their findings at a scientific symposium, and Finkelstein said she hopes they will eventually be coauthors of a peer-reviewed publication based on their results.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e81b0ce8807270463e8528b2f5d95ada"><name>nsf-grant-ethics-emerging-tech</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>National Science Foundation grant will help establish ethics and equity best practices for emerging forms of science and technology  </title><summary>Sociology Professor Jenny Reardon, founding director of the Science &amp; Justice Research Center at UC Santa Cruz, won a nearly $400,000 grant to study ethics and equity in the design of science and engineering projects. </summary><start-date>1665990000000</start-date><path>/2022/10/nsf-grant-ethics-emerging-tech</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/nsf-grant-ethics-emerging-tech</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1666046430419</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1666046521520</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/reardon_250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/reardon_250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>reardon_250.jpg</name><display-name>reardon_250.jpg</display-name><file-size>66363</file-size><width>250</width><height>375</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Jenny Reardon outdoors on the UCSC campus.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/reardon_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/reardon_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>reardon_80.jpg</name><display-name>reardon_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>27181</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Jenny Reardon outdoors on the UCSC campus.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sociology Professor Jenny Reardon</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sociology Professor Jenny Reardon, founding director of the </span><a href="https://scijust.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science &amp; Justice Research Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at UC Santa Cruz, won a nearly $400,000 National Science Foundation grant to study ethics and equity in the design of science and engineering projects. The project team will spend the next two years reviewing prior scholarship and examining case studies in the fields of genomics, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence to analyze how ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) and diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) are incorporated into science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We haven't had a lot of reflection on what the best practices are for going about this in ways that can lead to meaningful change,&#8221; Reardon said. &#8220;The goal is to create forms of science and technology that genuinely take questions of ethics and equity onboard and that transform their practices as a result.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reardon will lead the grant, alongside University of Washington Professor Sara Goering and Columbia University Professor Sandra Soo-Jin Lee. An advisory panel for the project will include faculty members from Stanford University, University of Washington, Harvard University, and UCLA. The team&#8217;s areas of expertise span fields including sociology, philosophy, history, anthropology, bioethics, and genomics, and all members have a wealth of experience in ELSI.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ELSI is a field of study that was first developed within genomics in the 1990s, in response to concerns about whether genomic data might be used to discriminate against people. Today, ELSI researchers study the societal implications of a wide range of emerging forms of science and technology. Racial bias in algorithms is one example. Addressing these types of issues is crucial to building public trust in science, and increasingly, major funders are requiring ELSI and DEI components in science and engineering projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Reardon says there&#8217;s not always a clear path for ELSI and DEI practitioners to influence outcomes. Some scientists and engineers may not recognize the importance of involving ELSI and DEI experts from the beginning of a project, to advise on research questions and methods, rather than only toward the end, when there&#8217;s less room for improvement. Another challenge is that critical findings from ELSI and DEI research are not always translated into action items that scientists and engineers can readily apply to their work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help address these issues, Reardon and the grant project team will ultimately use their findings to compile a set of specific recommendations and criteria for ethics best practices within science, technology, engineering, medicine and mathematics (STEM). The grant will fund the initial research phase of a larger project called Leadership in the Equitable and Ethical Design (LEED) of Science and Engineering, which takes inspiration from the concrete, practical style of recommendations offered by the U.S. Green Building Council&#8217;s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a lot of great work being done by scholars in ELSI, but the challenge is, how do you take those findings and translate them into something practical,&#8221; Reardon said. &#8220;Instead of hanging out in the space of ideas and visions of how science should be done, we wanted to think about STEM research as concrete, material practice and focus on the steps to getting it done.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LEED Science and Engineering project intends to offer a set of specific actions and practices for incorporating ethics and equity into science and engineering projects. Reardon says the criteria will be developed in consultation with national and international experts, in order to reflect global consensus on best-practices. The program will not aim to be a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather will provide a variety of options and examples.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A group like our Science &amp; Justice Research Center here at UC Santa Cruz might draw from the project to adopt a set of LEED practices that work for us, and those may be different from what another center would adopt,&#8221; Reardon explained. &#8220;But the point is that there are criteria. So when scientists and engineers come to us and ask us to collaborate on a project, we have a clear way to make those decisions, and we can hold our colleagues accountable for a certain level of practice and engagement around those criteria.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reardon says the idea for the LEED Science and Engineering project grew out of the Science &amp; Justice Research Center&#8217;s work. The center is primarily an interdisciplinary working group that takes a problem-solving approach to issues of equity and ethics in science, rather than focusing on theoretical questions. It also sponsors research and hosts a popular </span><a href="https://scijust.ucsc.edu/pedagogy/sjtp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">training program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for graduate students, which prepares the next generation of leaders to tackle issues of ethics and justice in scientific practice. The center&#8217;s leadership in the LEED Science and Engineering project will advance both its own work and that of the field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having a specific set of criteria will make it easier for the Science &amp; Justice Research Center to get involved in consulting on projects in the future and to add more value to them,&#8221; Reardon said. &#8220;And overall, I hope it will become easier for bioethics scholars from the social sciences, humanities, and the arts to collaborate with their science and engineering colleagues.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e82ff39b807270463e8528b2b917ffc9"><name>candidate-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>On-campus candidate forum to focus on affordable housing</title><summary>Candidates running for city and county offices will participate in an on-campus forum focused on affordable housing in Santa Cruz. </summary><start-date>1665990000000</start-date><display-name>On-campus candidate forum to focus on affordable housing</display-name><path>/2022/10/candidate-forum</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/candidate-forum</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1666047800195</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1666136177751</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/housing-flier.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/housing-flier.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>housing-flier.jpg</name><display-name>housing-flier.jpg</display-name><file-size>208826</file-size><width>612</width><height>792</height></image><image-alt>Housing flier</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Candidates running for city and county offices will participate in an on-campus forum focused on affordable housing in Santa Cruz.</p>

With the foundation&#8217;s much-appreciated support, I am confident we will be able to make great progress.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent surveys reflect that as many as 41 percent of U.S. college students experience limited or uncertain access to food. A chronic problem that dates back years, it&#8217;s exasperated by the rampant inflation of food costs hurting families nationwide. UC Santa Cruz recognizes that the need is great: Food-deprived college students exhibit poorer academic performance. Worse, according to the National Student Campaign Against Hunger and Homelessness, the negative outcomes hit Black, first-generation and two-year college students hardest, widening racial and income inequalities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We wanted to help and in a very direct way," said UCSC Foundation Chair Richard Moss (Stevenson '85). "Board members were inspired to support UC Santa Cruz in developing a roadmap promoting food security, not only for our campus, but as a model for all UC campuses."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board&#8217;s commitment will help UCSC in its effort to surpass the University of California Regents' goal of reducing food and housing insecurity among students by 50 percent by 2025. Systemwide and campus-level research affirm the positive impact of basic needs services on access, affordability, persistence, academic performance, sense of belonging, time to degree, and graduation rates of both undergraduate and graduate students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC is primed to advance a 2025 UCSC Road Map to Food Security (Design and Action Plan). The capacity to coordinate and engage a greater range of stakeholders in the Regent level goals is the plan&#8217;s next step.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundation grant will directly support students, funding salaries for student project leads who will help develop the road map, convene stakeholders and identify outcomes, as well as &#8220;food security&#8221; student staff to assist with stakeholder service opportunities and connection events, food production, and peer-to-peer student engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Championing student success means doing all we can to ensure equal and equitable access to the full student experience,&#8221; said Akirah Bradley-Armstrong, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success.&#160; &#8220;Too many of our students struggle with food insecurity and too few have access to the means and resources to resolve this struggle. While the university has long tried to fill these gaps, this funding is critical to ensuring student well-being and equipping each of our students with the time and energy they need to better focus on their learning in and out of the classroom. In order to truly center our students in all we do, we must first be certain their most basic needs are met.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundation board was seeking to support an across-campus initiative that aligned with the </span><a href="http://success.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Success Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Campus and Foundation leadership worked with Darryl Wong, executive director of the Center for Agroecology, and Tim Galarneau, education and research specialist at the center, to develop the plan for this project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Agroecology has played a leading role in creatively tackling food security. The center supports a different type of food pantry&#8212;harvesting and delivering over 20,000 pounds of fresh organic fruits and vegetables each year&#8212;as well as supporting a non-transactional cafe where students eat free of charge. In an effort to further support students&#8217; needs, the produce is grown, harvested and delivered by students who earn more than minimum wage.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Food security isn&#8217;t just about access to food, it&#8217;s also about having meaningful employment that supports all of the costs of being a student,&#8221; Wong said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to helping fund the development of an actionable plan for UC Santa Cruz, foundation trustees have committed to promoting the effort through their individual networks and to hosting a food security benefit event in 2023 to launch the plan.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="eba7cec4807270463e8528b2d5711bd5"><name>biological-hotspots</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Research to identify biological hotspots in the oceans will help reduce human impacts</title><summary>A grant from the Office of Naval Research funds research using elephant seals to find marine hotspots while providing support for undergraduate researchers, an assessment of ethical considerations, and training to create inclusive environments for field research.</summary><keywords>Roxanne Beltran</keywords><start-date>1666191600000</start-date><display-name>Research to identify biological hotspots in the oceans will help reduce human impacts</display-name><path>/2022/10/biological-hotspots</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/biological-hotspots</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1666105986737</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1666192889813</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/elephant-seals-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/elephant-seals-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>elephant-seals-450.jpg</name><display-name>elephant-seals-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>127495</file-size><width>450</width><height>346</height></image><image-alt>elephant seals</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/elephant-seal-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/elephant-seal-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>elephant-seal-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>elephant-seal-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19900</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>elephant seal</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Elephant seals are an ideal platform for gathering information about biological hotspots in the ocean.

<p>The project will provide valuable training for undergraduates and graduate students in Beltran&#8217;s lab, and the grant also includes funding for an assessment of ethical considerations in conducting field research with wild animals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our group has always emphasized the importance of mentoring and ethical practices, but we now have financial resources to put behind them, which is really exciting,&#8221; Beltran said.</p>
<p>The $750,000 grant includes over $100,000 budgeted for a paid field researcher program for undergraduate students. Each year, nine students will be brought into the elephant seal field research program through the Work-Study Research Initiative (WSRI), a program Beltran helped spearhead (with the science division&#8217;s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee) to streamline the process for undergraduate students to be active members of a research lab and conduct relevant research while being supported financially.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to train students from low-income and marginalized backgrounds, and we don&#8217;t want them to have to get paid jobs in retail or food service, so the funding for this paid field assistant program will help diversify our team,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The focus of the project is to obtain detailed information about the locations of areas in the ocean where intense biological activity leads to concentrations of marine organisms, including large marine vertebrates such as whales and seals drawn to aggregations of prey. Identifying these biological hotspots will enable the U.S. Navy to reduce negative interactions with wildlife during naval exercises.</p>
<p>UCSC researchers have been studying elephant seals for decades using sophisticated tagging technology to track their migrations and study their behavior at sea. The biologging instruments carried by the seals can also gather valuable information about the ocean environment, including sound recordings that can reveal the presence of elusive species such as beaked whales, which are known to be sensitive to Navy sonar.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we know where sensitive species are doing important things like feeding, then we can avoid activities that might affect the environment there,&#8221; said Dan Palance, a graduate student involved in the project who is leading a review of current knowledge about marine hotspots.</p>
<p>Elephant seals are an ideal platform for gathering information about biological hotspots, ranging far across the North Pacific Ocean and diving repeatedly into the depths in search of prey. They also return reliably to the breeding colony at A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve, where researchers can recover the instruments.</p>
<p>&#8220;These instruments have allowed us to make huge advances in what we know, not only about the animals themselves, but about the marine environment,&#8221; said Allison Payne, a graduate student in Beltran&#8217;s lab. &#8220;Elephant seals are an amazing mobile sensor platform for identifying biologically important areas, including places with large aggregations of prey.&#8221;</p>
<p>In their work with the elephant seals at A&#241;o Nuevo, UCSC researchers have always sought to minimize the impact on the animals of the instruments and the procedures involved in attaching and recovering them. But a comprehensive review of the ethics of biologging studies and guidelines for conducting and reporting such research has been lacking.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of thought goes into the size and shape of the biologgers to ensure the seals are not impacted by data collection&#8212;primarily because we care about these amazing animals, but also because our studies depend on recording their natural behavior,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;Allison&#8217;s dissertation will include developing a set of guidelines for how to plan ethical projects and how we should be reporting our practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another area of emphasis for Beltran has been ensuring safe environments for diverse young scientists participating in field research. Surveys have revealed a disturbing amount of harassment and bias in field settings, particularly for women and members of marginalized communities. Beltran worked with colleagues at UCSC, including Professor Erika Zavaleta and graduate student Melissa Cronin, to develop a program called Building a Better Fieldwork Future (BBFF) to offer sexual harassment trainings for scientific teams that do fieldwork.</p>
<p>The BBFF program will be administered as part of the field safety training for all members of the Beltran lab. In addition, Payne, who is now the program coordinator for BBFF, will lead an effort to expand the program to address a broader range of challenges in field settings. The goal is to ensure that field settings are safer, more equitable, and more welcoming for the next generation of field scientists.</p>
<p>Beltran said the proposal for this grant was a group effort by her lab, bringing together different approaches to address key questions about the locations and dynamics of biological hotspots in the ocean. In addition to high-resolution biologging techniques, the project will include analyzing stable isotopes in elephant seal whiskers for information on the diets of individual seals, which will help identify feeding hotspots. The researchers will also test drone technologies using forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras through the CITRIS Initiative for Drone Education and Research as a potential tool for counting animals and detecting hotspots.</p>
<p>&#8220;The grant pulls all of those efforts together, leveraging our existing data collection efforts to train a new generation of scientists in ethical, inclusive research,&#8221; Beltran said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ebc4a5a38072704674263bfd0ed4ba55"><name>spotlighting-transfer-excellence</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>STARS celebrates National Transfer Week; shines the spotlight on nine Transfer Excellence Leaders</title><summary>National Transfer Week is October 17 - 21.

<h1>Meet this year's Transfer Excellence Leaders!</h1>
<h3><a id="crystal"></a><strong>Crystal Alvarez Castillo, Senior</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Pronouns:&#160;</strong>she/her</p>
<p><strong>Major:&#160;</strong>Sociology</p>
<p><strong>Minor:&#160;</strong>Education</p>
<p><strong>College:&#160;</strong>Oakes College</p>
<p><strong>When do you anticipate graduating?&#160;</strong>Spring 2023</p>
<p><strong>Why Crystal was nominated: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crystal started working with me on a community-engaged research project "We Belong: Collaboration for Community-Engaged Research and Immigrant Justice" with a focus on the experiences of immigrant and mixed legal status families in Santa Cruz County. Because Crystal grew up in Watsonville, she has been an invaluable asset for our research project, working directly with the Jovenes Sanos youth organization in Watsonville to connect us with youth from immigrant backgrounds. She also helped organize a large community event in Watsonville last May 2022 to share our preliminary results and specifically helped translate many of our findings and posters into Spanish so that the wider Latinx community could have access to and learn from our research project. She is now working with me and with other students to translate our website and help write our final report.&#160;</span><strong>Nominated by: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven McKay</span></p>
<p><strong>Why UC Santa Cruz?&#160;</strong>I was born and raised in Watsonville, CA so the close proximity to my hometown influenced me to attend UCSC. I also always knew I wanted to work in my community and UCSC provided me the opportunity to stay and help out in my community while pursuing my higher education. Despite Watsonville being a short drive from UCSC, not many people from Watsonville attend. Every time I tell youth in my community that I attend UCSC they are amazed. It's an amazing feeling because for many I am the first person they know that attends UCSC. It&#8217;s an even better feeling when they tell me they are interested in attending UCSC!</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give transfer students? How did you get connected and find your place at UC Santa Cruz?:&#160;</strong>The biggest advice I would give to transfer students is to stay persistent. There are going to be moments when they might feel like giving up, but they always need to remind themselves that they earned their spot here.</p>
<p>Another advice is to not be afraid to try new things. UCSC offers many opportunities for students to form part of different activities (research opportunities, internships, clubs, etc) and find something that they love while meeting new people, ultimately allowing them to develop a sense of belonging. Professors are also great at connecting students to opportunities!</p>
<p><strong>What will your UCSC diploma mean to you?:</strong></p>
<p>By obtaining my diploma from UCSC I will demonstrate to my parents that their sacrifices weren&#8217;t in vain. It&#8217;s also going to serve as an inspiration for myself that I can obtain whatever I put my mind to, no matter how difficult it is. Most importantly, I can&#8217;t wait to say that this &#8220;low-income short brown girl from Watsonville&#8221; succeeded in an institution that was historically not created for her.</p>
<h3><strong><a id="laura"></a>Laura Galanos, Senior</strong></h3>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Pronouns:&#160;</strong>she/her</p>
<p><strong>Major:&#160;</strong>Critical Race and Ethnic Studies</p>
<p><strong>Minor:&#160;</strong>Economics</p>
<p><strong>College:&#160;</strong>Oakes</p>
<p><strong>When do you anticipate graduating?:&#160;</strong>Fall 2023</p>
<p><strong>Why Laura was nominated: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura is someone who models what it means to share openly and honestly about their lived experiences, especially to direct energy in building relationships within historically marginalized communities. I have had the privilege of supervising Laura directly within the Asian American/Pacific Islander Resource Center (AA/PIRC) since Fall 2021, and am proud for and with her as she created multiple spaces to build relationships within and expansive of our communities, relating to Asian American transracial adoptee experiences, and BIPOC in the outdoors in collaboration with the People of Color Sustainability Collective (PoCSC). Her presence as she is within and expansive of AA/PIRC helps make UCSC and this world a better place. Thank you Laura.&#160;</span><strong>Nominated by: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Benedicto Llave</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why UC Santa Cruz?:&#160;</strong>I picked UC Santa Cruz because of the emphasis they put on social justice and the humanities programs they have to offer.</p>
<p><strong>What are your co-curricular activities (ie., organizations, clubs, hobbies, etc.)?:&#160;</strong>I am an intern at the Asian American Pacific Islander Resource Center and am also a Neighborhood Assistant (synonymous with Resident Assistant) at Oakes College.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give transfer students? How did you get connected and find your place at UC Santa Cruz?:&#160;</strong>I would recommend getting involved with an organization on campus. Becoming an intern at AA/PIRC helped me find community and make professional connections at UCSC.</p>
<h3><a id="deshonne"></a>DeShonne Keller, Junior</h3>
<p><strong>Pronouns:&#160;</strong>She/Her/They/Them</p>
<p><strong>Major:&#160;</strong>Critical Race &amp; Enthic Studies</p>
<p><strong>College:&#160;</strong>Merrill-UCSC</p>
<p><strong>When do you anticipate graduating?:&#160;</strong>Spring 2024</p>
<p><strong>Why DeShonne was nominated: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeShonne Keller has been a pillar of the UC Santa Cruz community for the past 10 years.&#160; DeShonne started off her trajectory at UCSC as a staff member, working a variety of different positions throughout campus.&#160; DeShonne then decided to take part time classes at the local community college, and soon found herself actualizing her dream of successfully </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ring to a 4 year university.&#160; Though she&#8217;s only been a UCSC student for a short period of time, DeShonne has already taken strides towards making this institution a better place, by way of assisting with the planning and execution of the first ever &#8216;Black Day @ UCSC&#8217;, as well as by her hard work and dedication towards </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> students with the establishment of the Free STARS Personal Care Pantry. DeShonne&#8217;s care, hard work, and dedication make her a true </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> student leader who will leave their mark within the UCSC campus community.&#160;</span><strong>Nominated by:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jannet Ceja</span></p>
<p><strong>Why UC Santa Cruz?:&#160;</strong>UCSC was the only place for me to attend, as I have a family and wasn't going to be able to commute to another school. While in junior college, my colleagues from UCSC supported me during my journey as I'm not a traditional student. Because I'm a staff member, we are offered a discount on tuition. I'm so grateful for this employee perk. If I didn't have it, I don't believe I would have applied to UCSC. At this age, I couldn't see myself putting myself in debt. The reduced fee waiver for staff members is a blessing.</p>
<p><strong>What are your co-curricular activities (ie., organizations, clubs, hobbies, etc.)?:&#160;</strong>I enjoy going to concerts with friends and family. I'm a diehard football fan "GO SAINTS"!! I'm also a Umoja Core member on campus.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give transfer students? How did you get connected and find your place at UC Santa Cruz?:&#160;</strong>The first quarter as a transfer student can be stressful. Getting acquainted with a new campus, plus adjusting to the quarter system, is overwhelming. If possible, visit the campus. Be sure to read all emails from campus before classes begin. The campus sends out a lot of important information. Connect with your college advisor to set up a plan for the first quarter, and don't be afraid to ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and goals for life after graduation?:&#160;</strong>I want to continue working in my current position at STARS-Services for Transfer and Re-entry students as the Administrative Specialist. I want to get more involved with student programming and advising, and I believe I can assist students with their transition as transfer students, and I would also like to connect with more students who are non-traditional. We all walk different paths, and I hope I can be a blessing to incoming and current transfers as they've been to me.</p>

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Name:&#160;</strong>Noorain Bryan-Syed</p>
<p><strong>Pronouns:&#160;</strong>She/Her</p>
<p><strong>Major:&#160;</strong>Neuroscience</p>
<p><strong>College:&#160;</strong>Oakes</p>
<p><strong>When do you anticipate graduating?&#160;</strong>Spring 2023</p>
<p><strong>Why Noorain was nominated: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noorain joined my lab as part of a program aimed to support </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> students and provide research experience. She displayed exceptional leadership by working as the Lead Transition Mentor for STARS, where she supports incoming </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> students in navigating and acclimatizing to UCSC, finding resources, building community, and so much more. She is constantly thinking about new ways to support our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> student community and help build STEM identity. In addition to these leadership strengths she also performs fantastic research in my lab!&#160;</span><strong>Nominated by: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jordan Ward</span></p>
<p><strong>Why UC Santa Cruz?:&#160;</strong>I'll be honest, I came to UCSC because the campus is in the middle of the forest overlooking the ocean, which sounded serene, and it definitely is! After attending UCSC, I feel that I have come to love it even more. The people here are very friendly which is nice because a lot of educational institutions can be competitive, and that usually translates to the student culture, but I feel like here at UCSC we cultivate a community that welcomes people of all backgrounds which is very encouraging and beneficial to us all. All the professors and faculty that I have met have been nothing but kind and helpful, they are so dedicated to make sure that they are able to create a safe space for all of their students to learn, and I appreciate all of their hard work.</p>
<p><strong>What are your co-curricular activities (ie., organizations, clubs, hobbies, etc.)?:</strong></p>
<p>1. I work as a Lead Transition Mentor at the STARS office, and I am blessed to be part of such an amazing and dedicated team; my team and I work together to serve our transfer students by supporting and guiding them to make sure they have all the resources they need to be successful in their educational and personal lives.</p>
<p>2. I also am working in a research lab under Jordan Ward (who is an amazing Professor on campus); I only recently started working for his lab over the summer and I am so grateful for this position. I am gaining a ton of lab/research experience and I feel very valued being in the lab amongst all my colleagues, and for being a woman in STEM, I cherish every moment I get to be in the lab.</p>
<p>3. Finally, I am a part of the wonderful MSA (Muslim Student Association) on campus. I wanted to give a big shout out to our MSA because when I first started coming to UCSC last fall, I felt very isolated and when I learned about the MSA and started to attend the events, I felt so welcomed by everyone in this group. Our MSA may not be as big as other colleges and universities, but everyone in our MSA is definitely very tight knit and i am grateful for everyone I have met through this association.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give transfer students? How did you get connected and find your place at UC Santa Cruz?:&#160;</strong>Find your community, but more importantly, find yourself. As a transfer students, we go at a different pace than other students. We may have more experience, and we may have more drive, but we definitely need more friends. There's gonna be a lot of crying and late nights of studying, but make sure you have friends who you can cry with. Also make sure to explore yourself, you will be in the middle of a forest, take nature walks, give yourself breaks, make sure to drink water. You made it to university, you belong here, but you also deserve to be happy so make sure to take care of yourself along the way.</p>
<p><strong>What will your UCSC diploma mean to you?:&#160;</strong>To my younger self, my diploma will be the "congratulations, you did it" letter that she always knew was to come. To my present self, my diploma will mean that there are still a lot of bumps and roads ahead that I have to cross throughout life. For my future self, my diploma will be a distant memory that I can reminisce on to remind myself where it all began.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and goals for life after graduation?:&#160;</strong>I have a lot of plans for after I graduate, I hope to attend graduate school, get a Ph.D. in Neuroscience, and pursue a career in research, but the one thing I hope I can keep with me through it all is my love and passion for learning. It's my work ethic that has gotten me this far, and I know it will keep me going.</p>
<h3><a id="hassan"></a>Hassan Pathan, Senior</h3>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Pronouns:&#160;</strong>he/him</p>
<p><strong>Major:&#160;</strong>Applied Mathematics</p>
<p><strong>College:&#160;</strong>John R. Lewis</p>
<p><strong>When do you anticipate graduating?:&#160;</strong>June 2023</p>
<p><strong>Why Hassan was nominated: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hassan Pathan has positively contributed to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> community in many ways. Prior to joining UCSC, Hassan worked at his community college, Evergreen Valley, as a supplemental instructor supporting the learning of his peers. After only being at UCSC for 1 quarter, Hassan sought out the STARS Transition Mentor position to continue his leadership. In his work as a Transit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ion Mentor Hassan provided one on one mentorship through meaningful relationships with incoming </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> students and additionally served as a representative for various events to increase awareness of STARS across UCSC and community colleges. Hassan's commitment to sharing his experiential knowledge and ensuring </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> students know they belong and are supported at UCSC is a testament to his care for others and his leadership.&#160;</span><strong>Nominated by: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Vivianna Alvarez</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why UC Santa Cruz?:&#160;</strong>I chose UC Santa Cruz mainly because of the cost and how close it was to home (San Jose). My family is very important to me, so visiting and staying connected with them was definitely a top priority when it came to choosing schools. But then when I got here I was also thankful it was such a beautiful campus and so close to the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>What are your co-curricular activities (ie., organizations, clubs, hobbies, etc.)?:&#160;</strong>I worked as a transition mentor for STARS for a year and that was a huge part of my development here at UCSC. I was also part of the Rocket team here where we design, prototype, build, and launch a 12 foot rocket for the NASA SLI (student launch initiative) competition. Some of my favorite things to do are watch movies (especially space related), photography around the city, weightlifting, and meeting new people. I took a sailing class last winter quarter so I think we can add that to my list of hobbies as well. I currently work as a math study hall tutor for LSS so that has also been really fun. I think of the study hall like an emergency room at a hospital; you never know what kind of problem someone is going to come in with.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give transfer students? How did you get connected and find your place at UC Santa Cruz?:&#160;</strong>Branch out as much as you can. There are so many opportunities on this campus. From the different resources, professors, and peers; you can learn and experience so many unique things that you never even thought you'd enjoy. I got connected and found my place at UC Santa Cruz mainly through STARS. It was like a wormhole into a fruitful community in so many aspects. I got to connect with other first-gen transfers which was very comforting. I also found people with similar interests just from random conversations, whether it be in class or at a dining hall. Another piece of advice is don't be afraid of being alone. As a transfer student, we come in not knowing many people so you might feel pretty isolated at first. Get comfortable being your own best friend and you will never feel uncomfortable being out doing things alone.</p>
<p><strong>What will your UCSC diploma mean to you?:&#160;</strong>Diploma? It's a degree right?? Either way, to me it's going to mean that I can provide for my family now properly and help me build a sustainable life for myself, my community, and hopefully the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and goals for life after graduation?:&#160;</strong>My hope and goal overall is to work at NASA. Honestly in any department, I think the work they do is amazing and so abstract. I spent a brief time there before the pandemic and got to experience the growth culture and creative environment. It really aligned with my values in an ideal workplace. I also hope to live a comfortable life and spread my wealth to those who need it.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give transfer students? How did you get connected and find your place at UC Santa Cruz?&#160;</strong>Coming into a four-year, quarter-system institution, one will be faced with many challenges, but we do not need to tackle them by ourselves. UC Santa Cruz is equipped with mentors to guide us every step of the way There are plenty of resources on campus to help transfer students to transition into university smoothly, so take time to learn about these resources. Lastly, find a community that will best support you in your time of need. Though we only have two years to complete our degree, make the most of your experience here because we won&#8217;t have this time again. We are transfer students, come ready and prepared; know that we belong here.</p>
<p><strong>What will your UCSC diploma mean to you?&#160;</strong>My UCSC diploma will be another critical stepping stone in my professional and educational career. The final checkpoint will tell me that I am ready for the next chapter in higher education. It represents all the challenges I overcame, my determination and dedication to being the first in my family to graduate from college, and most of all showing my friends and family back home that it's possible for people from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their goals.</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes and goals for life after graduation?&#160;</strong>My goal after graduation is to be enrolled in a Ph.D. program in bioengineering to further my higher education experience. I am deeply interested in researching new and exciting applications of biology as solutions for medical and societal issues. During my Ph.D. experience, I want to mentor transfer students to find their own way to be successful.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she was a student at UC Santa Cruz, Xiomara Lopez (Oakes &#8217;14, legal studies) found it&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenging to be so far from her family and community in South Central LA. She often found herself navigating between the two worlds of home and university. But, in her second year, Lopez&#8212;a first-generation college graduate&#8212;became actively engaged with El Centro, and was able to find community at UCSC. Eight years later, Lopez is the Director of El Centro, coming full circle to the center that transformed her undergraduate experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It has been a meaningful experience to return to the place that had a formative impact on my development, not only as a scholar but as a professional in student affairs,&#8221; Lopez said. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a beautiful and humbling experience to be back at UCSC. This is my dream role, and this is where I&#8217;ve wanted to come back to serve students.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a student, Lopez interned for El Centro, was involved with Sigma Lambda Gamma Sorority and the Legal Education Association for Diversity (LEAD), and was an academic intern for GEAR UP with the Educational Partnership Center (EPC). It was through her involvement at El Centro, that she learned about Latinx student organizations and was able to take on various leadership opportunities on campus that contributed to her sense of belonging at the university. In addition, her work providing college advising and preparation workshops to middle school students and families with GEAR UP solidified her decision to pursue a master&#8217;s degree in the educational counseling programs at the University of Southern California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Director of El Centro, Lopez is committed to providing meaningful opportunities to current Chicanx and Latinx students at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At El Centro, we nurture a &#8220;home away from home&#8221; by affirming students&#8217; identities, honoring our cultural wealth, and bringing awareness of the social and equity realities of our communities. Through a community approach, we equip students with the skills and resources to thrive, to take action to achieve justice in our communities, and cultivate joy&#8221; Lopez said. &#8220;Our programs and opportunities for involvement provide students with community, leadership development, and critical thinking skills.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez says some of her goals for El Centro include increasing the visibility and reach of the center among students and the campus community, fostering a sense of belonging, and celebrating the legacy of Chicanx Latinx students and alumni at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Lopez&#8217;s goal is to continue to grow and amplify the academic internship program offered at El Centro which transformed her undergraduate and professional experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For me, being an intern at El Centro was a transformative experience, and ultimately, it&#8217;s what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inspired me to engage in cultural center work,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Lopez said. &#8220;And so, one of my biggest goals is to continue to engage with students by welcoming them into our space and providing holistic support and opportunities that will contribute to their academic and career development.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to engaging with students, Lopez says there are various ways for alumni to stay&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">involved, including joining the UC Chicanx Latinx Alumni Association (UC CLAA), and the UCSC Latinx Alumni Network, attending upcoming El Centro events, and participating in El Centro&#8217;s Giving Day campaign to help raise funds for cultural stoles gifted to graduating Latinx students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez says to look out for multiple upcoming events open to alumni, such as the&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Courageous Career Conversations, once known as the Multicultural Career Conference. Alumni&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are invited to participate in various panels and connect with undergraduate students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m working to develop meaningful relationships with alumni,&#8221; Lopez says. &#8220;So I encourage and welcome alumni to reach out if they have any ideas or want to get connected to El Centro and the students here.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ebfd7af18072704674263bfdcec78667"><name>weapons-violation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Timely Warning Crime Bulletin: Weapons Violation</title><summary>At 6:46 p.m. today, Oct. 17, a UCSC student reported that 30 minutes earlier, an unknown male jumped around the corner of a building near Thimann Lecture Hall and brandished a knife with an approximately 5-7-inch blade.</summary><start-date>1665990000000</start-date><display-name>Timely Warning Crime Bulletin: Weapons Violation</display-name><path>/2022/10/weapons-violation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/weapons-violation</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1666111601369</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1666111601369</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>This Timely Warning crime bulletin is being issued in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act).

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Thursday, October 20, students are invited to stop by Quarry Plaza between 11 a.m. and 1:30 p.m and McHenry Library between 2 and 3:30 p.m. to share ideas, answer questions, and provide feedback that will help determine just what a redesigned Bay Tree Building will look like and how it can best serve students needs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s full speed ahead to transform the building into a bustling hub of student services. The project will consist of multiple stages, starting with a robust visioning phase that begins this week with the aforementioned pop-up events and will continue with stakeholder feedback sessions and campus town halls. The effort to redesign and renovate the Bay Tree building and surrounding area will be led by a multi-unit, cross-divisional planning and building committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is expected to take three years to reach completion. If all goes well with visioning, preliminary plans should be presented to the university in winter quarter.

AA/PIRC co-creates engagement with students who identify as part of the Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Southwest Asian and North African (SWANA) diaspora at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the direction of Caz Salamanca, who began his role in 2019, the AA/PIRC has continued to cultivate a hub of engagement and support for identifying communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want all students to affirm their identities and the larger picture is that we want students to feel okay with being who they are and bring all of themselves to the table,&#8221; Salamanca said. &#8220;We want students to know that all of themselves will be welcomed, accepted, and validated.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salamanca said that the Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Southwest Asian &amp; North African</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">diaspora is a vast umbrella that addresses many different ethnic identities; AA/PIRC&#8217;s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimate goal is to provide meaningful resources, and programming for the communities in its</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">scope; as well as education about these communities to overall campus.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goals are building spaces and programming where folks can find community, build</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">community, learn about themselves, and learn about each other,&#8221; Salamanca said. &#8220;All the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">while, finding ways to recognize and address the personal and systemic oppressions that we</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in our communities face.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past couple of years, Salamanca has created support groups and organized</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">community gatherings for Asian American students throughout the rise of xenophobic rhetoric at</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The racism and violence that impacted our community aren&#8217;t new. It&#8217;s taken new forms, and it&#8217;s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">gotten renewed visibility in the media, but it&#8217;s not new,&#8221; Salamanca said. &#8220;By hosting those</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">healing spaces for the campus, it&#8217;s assuring to know that there is a community out there that</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">can come together and be present, whether in-person or virtually.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salamanca graduated from UC San Diego with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Cognitive Science and earned his master&#8217;s degree from San Diego State University. He&#8217;s garnered over 12twelve years of experience in higher education, with his most recent previous experience being an Adviser and Diversity Programs Coordinator for the School of Public Health at the University of Washington in Seattle. He&#8217;s served in professional organizations including, the API Caucus of the National Conference on Race and Ethnicity in Higher Education (NCORE), and the California Council of Cultural Centers in Higher Education (CaCCCHE).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether AA/PIRC was a significant part of students&#8217; UCSC experience, Salamanca says he</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">hopes to establish a connection with alumni looking to make an impact.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I would love to be able to work with folks and utilize alumni&#8217;s strengths and introduce them to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">our current students and provide spaces where there are opportunities to mentor, educate, and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">share their resources, wisdom, and experiences with our current students,&#8221; Salamanca said. &#8220;I</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">would love to help alumni pour back into a place and to a community that helped impact their</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">experiences and trajectory.&#8221;</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ec82691f8072704674263bfdb56f1f2f"><name>autumn-johnson</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Empowering agency: AARCC's Autumn Johnson</title><summary>Autumn Johnson graduated from UCSC in 2015.

She had previously served at San Francisco State University as the Senior Director of Culture &amp; Social Justice Programs, and was leaving the field to pursue Law School, until she saw the post shared by the previous director. Seeing the post helped her recognize that this role could be described as her dream job.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I felt like all of my experiences as a professional in the field, as a graduate student, and undergrad were coalescing in a way that allowed me to really be of service,&#8221; Johnson says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson graduated from UCSC in 2015 and is an alumna of the African American Theater Arts Troupe (AATAT) and the SoMeCa space. She followed a wide career path across fields and industries: from working in restaurants, to working as a substitute teacher, and eventually, attending graduate school at San Francisco State University. After finishing her program at SFSU, Autumn served as a full-time staff member on that campus. Yet, even across all of her career paths, nothing was quite like her experience at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Coming back the first time, I saw some deer on the side of the windy road, and it totally brought me back,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;I recognized this is such a unique place, and having been out of it for about seven years, I forgot. &#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AARCC serves African, Black, and Caribbean (ABC) students from their first moments coming to campus, often through Black Academy to the moment they cross stage at Black Grad. When a student identifies with an ABC demographic in their application, they&#8217;re&#160; automatically signed onto the AARCC&#8217;s newsletter, giving them an immediate connection to the multitude of programs, support services, and social and cultural events offered by the center.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her work as the AARCC director, Johnson finds her time at UCSC coming full circle. Starting as a student and mentee, she now finds herself grabbing lunch and enjoying walks with the advisors and mentors she learned from as an undergrad. The AARCC helps continue the passing down of knowledge even further, through the African American Mentorship Program (AAMP), where ABC students connect to four or five mentors and stay in contact to guide them throughout the academic year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I get to do the not so fun stuff, and bear witness to the fun stuff,&#8221; Johnson says. &#8220;As the director, I get to set a foundation to empower our student interns to take agency.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson is hopeful that AARCC&#8217;s alumni will help contribute new opportunities to a new generation of students. She encourages alumni to keep in contact with the AARCC to stay in community with our students. We are hoping to build mentorship through these alumni connections.</span></p>

(<span>Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Heart disease is a leading cause of death <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death"><span class="s2">worldwide</span></a>, and catching it early can make a significant difference for prevention of future cardiovascular events. But in many places, there is limited accessibility to technology that can detect early signs of the disease, such as coronary artery calcification (CAC), when the flow of blood through the arteries is blocked by a buildup of plaque, increasing the likelihood of a heart attack.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently, detecting CAC requires CT scans which are costly, deliver large doses of radiation, and must be done in a hospital setting &#8211; but UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Shiva Abbaszadeh is developing a solution that will make this preventative health care much more accessible. With a new $2 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, Abbaszadeh and her collaborator at Stanford University Assistant Professor of Radiology <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/adamwang?tab=bio"><span class="s2">Adam Wang</span></a> will develop new technology for detecting CAC that can be easily incorporated into routine chest x-rays, the most common medical imaging procedure.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Having an x-ray system that is easily portable can make a huge difference for some areas that might not have access to CT scans because they need a hospital environment,&#8221; Abbaszadeh said. &#8220;We can advance material decomposition and lesion differentiation of x-ray imaging.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The novel technology will be an advanced, dual-layer x-ray detector, producing both a traditional image of the body as well as a material-specific image which, in this case, would detect calcium. Wang&#8217;s team will develop artificial intelligence algorithms to automatically detect and quantify how much calcium is present. The technology will be a drop-in solution for existing clinical procedures and doesn&#8217;t require any additional radiation or scan time.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the researchers will initially focus on CAC detection, they believe their system could be used for early detection of lung and breast cancer, tuberculosis, and other diseases.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We are developing a technology platform by combining innovations in materials science, radiation detection, circuit design, and computation to bring new capabilities to x-ray imaging,&#8221; Abbaszadeh said. &#8220;One application is what we&#8217;ve targeted &#8211; coronary artery calcification &#8211; but the problem is much bigger and can have a wide impact.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To create the next-generation technology for x-ray imaging, Abbaszadeh and her students will utilize the equipment in her lab at the Baskin School of Engineering to engineer the optical and electrical properties of chalcogenide material &#8211; materials that contain one or more chalcogen elements. This facility, which is dedicated to developing detectors based on chalcogenide alloys of the element selenium, is the only such facility in a research setting in the country to Abbaszadeh and Wang&#8217;s knowledge.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A dedicated facility for detector development presents a wide range of research opportunities for Abbaszadeh&#8217;s lab, as the material has properties that are well-suited for both photodetectors, used for applications ranging from medical imaging to high-energy physics.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This collaborative project will provide exciting opportunities for students in the two researcher&#8217;s groups to be part of a larger learning environment in which they can visit each other's labs and gain experience with all facets of their technology, including hardware engineering, AI development, and the clinical setting in which their work will be put to use.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wang and Abbaszadeh will also collaborate with researchers at the Stanford School of Medicine, who will provide input on how to best design their systems for use in the clinical setting and provide images from real instances of CAC to train Wang&#8217;s AI models. Former Stanford instructor Martin Willemink and Stanford Professor Dominik Fleischmann provided input into the development of the project, and Fleischmann, who is the director of Stanford&#8217;s cardiovascular imaging division, will continue to lend his expertise. They will also collaborate with industry partners to demonstrate the performance of the new system.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Between the detector physics that Shiva&#8217;s working on, and the artificial intelligence algorithms we're developing at Stanford, we&#8217;re providing better image input information but also we will have algorithms that automatically detect and quantify how much calcium there is,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an improvement on multiple fronts.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f24ff90e807270462ce4bea21281507b"><name>salton-sea-recommendations</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC faculty, staff, and students support Salton Sea restoration planning</title><summary>An independent review panel supported by UC Santa Cruz recently completed its work evaluating restoration options to address environmental, public health, and economic issues in the Salton Sea region. </summary><start-date>1666162800000</start-date><path>/2022/10/salton-sea-recommendations</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/salton-sea-recommendations</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1666217670901</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1666742999342</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/panel_sea-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/panel_sea-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>panel_sea-400.jpg</name><display-name>panel_sea-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>74801</file-size><width>400</width><height>297</height></image><image-alt>A group of people stand at the water's edge</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/sea-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/sea-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sea-80.jpg</name><display-name>sea-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>21781</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>A group of people stand at the water's edge</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies Professor Brent Haddad, second from left, and members of the Independent Review Panel conducted a site visit at Bombay Beach on the Salton Sea in&#160;November 2021 as part of the panel's work to evaluate water importation concepts.&#160;</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong><a href="ucsc-restauracion-del-salton-sea.xml">Leer en Espa&#241;ol</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An independent review panel supported by UC Santa Cruz recently completed its work evaluating restoration options for the Salton Sea, a shrinking lake in Southern California that has become one of the state&#8217;s most challenging environmental problems.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the last 2,000 years, the Salton Sea has fluctuated between two states&#8212;a lake or a dry desert basin, likely depending on the course of the Colorado River. But the current version of the lake was created in the early 1900s, when irrigation canals from the Colorado River broke temporarily, spilling a massive amount of water into the previously dry Salton Basin. Today, the Salton Sea is California&#8217;s largest lake. But it has been losing volume since the early 2000s, due to reduced agricultural runoff entering the sea as water is transferred to urban areas in coastal California.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This loss of water has increased the salinity of the sea to nearly twice that of ocean water, resulting in declining populations of fish and birds. The lake&#8217;s shrinking volume has also exposed formerly submerged portions of shoreline, called playa. Winds whipping across the dry playa uplift dust particles that may worsen local air quality and contribute to high rates of respiratory illnesses in primarily Latino surrounding communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation has continued to devolve over several decades, in part because appropriate restoration methods for the Salton Sea are difficult to identify and implement, and proposals are often both costly and contentious. In 2021, the State of California Salton Sea Management Program (SSMP) awarded a contract to the University of California, Santa Cruz to evaluate one particular form of restoration strategy: water importation concepts to refill the sea. Environmental Studies Professor Brent Haddad was the principal investigator on this project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been studying water management and water governance for most of my career and have been involved in many big projects, but none quite as complex and consequential as this one,&#8221; Haddad said. &#8220;The Salton Sea is a challenge that involves every aspect of water management, from engineering to governance to ecology to economy to public health.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Assessing water-importation concepts</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tackle the specific question of whether it was feasible to import enough water from California&#8217;s Pacific coast, the Colorado River, or Mexico&#8217;s Sea of Cortez to refill the Salton Sea, Haddad established an Independent Review Panel to advise the state. The panel was chaired by Rominder Suri, Professor and Chair of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Temple University, and consisted of seven experts in different aspects of water-body restoration, including engineering, ecology, economics, biogeochemistry, and law.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adina Paytan, a research scientist and lecturer for UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences served on the panel. Haddad himself was not a member of the panel. Instead, he oversaw the research and administrative team&#8212;including UCSC Professors Yihsu Chen and Michael Loik, graduate students Daniel Hastings, Hannah Newburn, Sepehr Ramyar, Prem Patel, Charlie Chesney, and Siyu Luo, project coordinator Azucena Beltran, and staff from the UC Santa Cruz Institute for Social Transformation&#8212;that supported the panel&#8217;s work.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel evaluated 18 specific ideas for water importation that were submitted by the public during two Requests for Information in 2018 and 2021. Of these, three approaches avoided a set of five &#8220;</span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Salton-Sea-Independent-Review-Panel-Fatal-Flaw-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fatal flaws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; that Panel members agreed no viable approach to water importation should have. The three approaches without fatal flaws, which all involved drawing water from the Sea of Cortez, were then combined into a Sea of Cortez Import Concept that underwent a detailed feasibility study, including cost, permitting, engineering, geotechnical, and benefits analyses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Feasibility_Report_9-29-22_Final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feasibility study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that, while the Sea of Cortez concept was theoretically possible from an engineering perspective, it was extremely expensive, brought significant risk of environmental damage, would take decades to complete, and provided limited benefits to Mexico. As a result, there was a strong potential that desired benefits to the Salton Sea would either be long delayed or never realized. So ultimately, the panel&#8217;s </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Summary_Report_9-29-22_Final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">final report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> did not recommend that the state proceed with any of the initially proposed water importation concepts. Haddad said he believes the panel made a sound, evidence-based decision on this matter.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think this gets us off of a potentially financially catastrophic track, where we could have been stuck trying to build a canal forever, without ever yielding a drop of water for the Salton Sea,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;And each year, the salinity in the lake grows and more playa is exposed, making the challenge that much more difficult. So speed is of the essence.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Recommending alternatives</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the panel evaluated the feasibility of refilling the Salton Sea through the Sea of Cortez Import Concept, they also identified two other possible restoration approaches, which were both put through the same feasibility study. All three approaches proposed a large desalination facility at the Salton Sea. The excess salt produced in the process would be transported and disposed of in landfills off site via existing railroad lines. But the two additional concepts proposed water importation only at levels necessary to replace the amount of water lost in the desalination process. These concepts included plans to expand ongoing playa stabilization projects to minimize dust-related impacts on air quality.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These additional approaches were considered because the panel concluded there was strong research evidence to suggest that environmental, air quality, and economic goals for the region could be achieved while maintaining the Salton Sea at a lower volume than its mid- to late-20th century levels. Stabilizing the Salton Sea at a new smaller size would avoid the environmental damage and high cost that would result from attempting to totally refill the sea, and benefits could potentially be realized sooner and be more sustainable in the long term.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This project really requires thinking about water in a very broad, holistic way, because we are in the midst of a drought that is likely to get worse, and any water that is going to the Salton Sea is water that will be missing elsewhere,&#8221; said panel member Adina Paytan. &#8220;So, if it&#8217;s possible to resolve air pollution issues and improve ecosystem health without having to maintain as large of a water body in the desert, that&#8217;s a win-win situation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the two approaches that the panel considered for restoring a smaller Salton Sea proposed replacing water lost to desalination with agricultural water from the Colorado River, via a voluntary transfer program. This plan, called the Colorado River Voluntary Transfer Concept, was based on recent successful programs undertaken by the Imperial Irrigation District (IID), in which California farmers were paid to fallow their fields, thereby freeing up water to flow to the Salton Sea. Converting agricultural practices to more water efficient crops and technologies or expanding the voluntary water program or water exchange programs to urban areas should also be studied, according to the panel&#8217;s recommendations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the findings of the feasibility study, the panel determined that the Colorado River Voluntary Transfer Concept, while challenging, was feasible overall. As a result, they&#8217;re recommending it to the state. The panel estimates that this plan would allow the Salton Sea&#8217;s salinity level to return to roughly ocean-level salinity as soon as 2051, and the eventual equilibrium water level of the Salton Sea would rest at roughly 258 feet below mean sea level.&#160;</span></p>
<h2>Toward a healthier future for the Salton Sea</h2>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The members of the UC Santa Cruz team that supported the panel&#8217;s work hope that the project&#8217;s recommendations will bring clarity and could help to spur progress on restoration.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the big challenges with Salton Sea restoration is that there are a lot of ways to do it wrong, and the stakes are that local people have been waiting for decades to learn what will happen to this really important feature in their region,&#8221; Haddad said. &#8220;A feasible, cost-effective plan that could restore environmental benefits and minimize the Salton Sea&#8217;s contribution to air quality problems could really help the region move forward.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the process, the panel and members of the research team sought input from local communities to better understand the issues facing the region and took field trips to visit the Salton Sea and northern Mexico. Project coordinator Azucena Beltran, a UCSC alumna who grew up in the Salton Sea region, helped to ensure that all public engagement processes were accessible to Spanish-speaking communities. Key project communications were translated into Spanish, and public meetings were structured as bilingual interpreted conversations, followed by question and answer sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team hopes that these practices might offer a model for future public engagement work around the Salton Sea, to ensure that voices from local communities are heard. Beltran said it will likely take communities some time to digest the Independent Review Panel&#8217;s latest reports, but the findings are already stimulating productive conversation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For so long, all we&#8217;ve heard as community members was that the sea was the reason for poor air quality, and the only solution talked about was water importation, so personally, I&#8217;m relieved to know that there are other options that could be less expensive and have the same effect,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It makes restoration feel more realistic and doable.

Now she is paving the way for the next generation of math and science protégés seeking their own North Star</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julia Stewart&#8217;s (Crown &#8217;24, astronomy) passion for all things space-related began at an early age. She was an avid reader; her grandparents stocked her bookshelves with books about planets and the solar system. At her fifth-grade graduation, when it was her turn to announce her intention for what she&#8217;d like to become, she proudly proclaimed that she was going to be an astrophysicist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In high school, Stewart excelled at math and science&#8211;passions further bolstered through her job at the Chabot Space &amp; Science Center in which she demonstrated basic science principles through hands-on experiments with visitors. When she learned about the California State Summer School for Math and Science (COSMOS) in her junior year, she eagerly applied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been interested in astronomy from a young age, but no kid reading books can get a real sense of what the field is really like,&#8221; Stewart said. &#8220;COSMOS provided a more detailed picture of astrophysics, helped me get comfortable interacting with professors, and helped me hone skills that I continue to use today.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was one of more than 200 high-achieving students in grades 8&#8211;12 from across the state who spent four weeks on the UC Santa Cruz campus learning advanced math concepts, participating in hands-on lab experiments, and engaging with current research led by UCSC faculty and graduate students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart had many firsts during her COSMOS experience. She was introduced to college-level calculus (multivariable derivatives) and physics concepts and she was thrilled to experience her first close-up view of the galaxies at night through the telescope at the Lick Observatory. She also explored the physics of sound and the astrophysics of light and studied rotation curves and dark matter content of galaxies as part of her COSMOS final project.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There was a lot of advanced stuff that was new to me. I hadn&#8217;t taken calculus yet, and it was a big part of the course. I learned concepts as a high school junior that I didn&#8217;t come back to until my second year of college. But the faculty and grad students made it fun, and they were very supportive.&#8221;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What stood out to me about Julia was that she was positively intense,&#8221; said professor and astronomer Puragra (Raja) GuhaThakurta, who serves as chair of the Department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics. He led the astrophysics course for Julia&#8217;s cluster.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She was motivated to learn and had an extraordinarily high level of engagement,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was happy to see that she chose Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an easy choice for Stewart.</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;I made my decision based on my COSMOS experience,&#8221; said Stewart a junior majoring in astrophysics. &#8220;I saw that the department was collaborative and supportive, and I knew it was a place in which I could thrive. It was an excellent decision.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A highlight of her college experience was being selected to participate in a National Science Foundation Research for Undergraduate Experience (REU) in the summer of 2022. She spent several weeks in New York at the American Museum of Natural History where she expanded on research focused on interstellar hydrogen clouds in the Milky Way Galaxy. Her COSMOS experience came into play immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The very first day of the REU, I was working on a software system that I learned to use in COSMOS,&#8221; Stewart said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not all COSMOS students matriculate to UCSC, the quality of the experience and the opportunity to engage with world-renowned researchers gives students the confidence to pursue degrees in STEM fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The purpose of the program is for us to identify students who are exceptionally motivated and also to enable students to see who we are as a university from a people aspect,&#8221; said GuhaThakurta. &#8220;When high school students apply to college, they apply to an institution. They rarely see the people of the university. The scientists they read about in textbooks are not the scientists of today. COSMOS gives them the chance to interact with today&#8217;s academics and to see the full range of diversity of those who are pushing the frontiers of knowledge.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart is excelling in her studies and has found her niche at UCSC. She attributes her success to the collaborative and supportive environment that originally attracted her to the department.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing that gender minority groups have long been underrepresented in STEM fields, Stewart is serving as an officer in the Society of Physics Students and participating in Women in Physics and Astrophysics, whose mission includes balancing and diversifying the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by her two experiences working in a museum setting, Stewart is considering the idea of sharing her work through science communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Astrophysics is not simple; it can get technical very quickly,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am intrigued by people who work in museums, write books, or use podcasts to communicate astrophysics to the general public. It&#8217;s a fun way for people to learn about a complex field.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COSMOS was the portal through which Stewart found UCSC, where she is now paving the way for the next generation of math and science prot&#233;g&#233;s who are looking for their own North Star.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f67a7a9180727046264adab216e1f4de"><name>food-systems-novel-protein</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Food system researcher unpacks the narratives driving a race for new protein sources</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz professor and food system expert Julie Guthman's latest paper explores the cultural mythologies around protein that are being spread through marketing and fundraising efforts for novel protein products. </summary><start-date>1666249200000</start-date><path>/2022/10/food-systems-novel-protein</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/food-systems-novel-protein</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1666287565433</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1666287841735</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/guthman-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/guthman-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>guthman-250.jpg</name><display-name>guthman-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>60316</file-size><width>250</width><height>264</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Julie Guthman</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/guthman-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/guthman-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>guthman-80.jpg</name><display-name>guthman-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>21257</file-size><width>80</width><height>85</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Julie Guthman</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz professor and food system expert Julie Guthman</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across Silicon Valley and beyond, tech entrepreneurs are making big promises to disrupt our diets. Their aim is to tackle global hunger, climate change, and animal welfare issues by replacing meat with alternative proteins derived from increasingly far-out sources, like insect larvae, plastic waste, or even thin air. This race to develop new sources of protein has become the leading edge of a rapidly growing agri-food innovation space. But are novel proteins really the most productive focus for so much attention and investment?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To try to answer that question, UC Santa Cruz professor and food system expert Julie Guthman took a deep dive into the tech industry&#8217;s protein engineering efforts. In her </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41292-022-00287-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she argues that deeply-rooted cultural mythologies around protein are being adopted and spread by tech companies as they market and fundraise for novel protein products. And those efforts may be obscuring other existing food system solutions that could be readily implemented with more public support and awareness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There's so much hype and interest in entrepreneurship to develop these new technologies as alternatives without necessarily thinking about other ways to deal with the problem,&#8221; Guthman explained. &#8220;So what we're looking at in our latest research is what kinds of assumptions innovators are bringing to the table in how they pitch and frame what they&#8217;re doing and how those assumptions square with prior social science research.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guthman and her coauthor studied this issue using databases, market maps, and directories of the sector&#8212;as well as published programs from Bay-Area food and agriculture tech events&#8212;to compile a comprehensive list of companies working in agri-food innovation that were either based in or connected with Silicon Valley. The team then reviewed information on these companies from websites and media, listened in on nearly 100 industry events, and conducted over 80 interviews with entrepreneurs, investors, and other sector leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analysis identified 84 companies and products developing foods from new sources or processes, and of those, the vast majority were focused on alternative proteins. 24 were working on plant-based simulations of animal products, 12 were investing in technologies to grow meat at the cellular level, and 27 were using other novel sources to make protein ingredients. Researchers also looked closely at how companies communicate about products like these.</span></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s behind the focus on protein?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guthman says the intense interest in protein development is driven in part by concerns around the livestock industry&#8217;s animal welfare issues and carbon footprint. But many companies also discuss their products as solutions to a looming global protein shortage.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This perceived protein crisis, Guthman says, is one of the most prominent myths at play in the industry. The paper argues that projections of future protein scarcity are based largely on increased demand for animal products among a growing global middle class, but these shifting dietary preferences are not the same thing as an actual global nutritional need.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another prominent narrative used to support the development of alternative proteins is the assumed nutritional goodness of protein, in any form or amount. Guthman says this ultimately stems from a diet and nutrition culture that promotes fad-like vilification of other macronutrients, most notably fats and carbohydrates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There's this popular sense that you can eat as much protein as you want, but you should really watch how many carbohydrates or fats you eat,&#8221; Guthman explained. &#8220;Protein somehow gets to remain uniquely heroic. There are long histories of protein being associated with masculinity and strength and being advertised for energy and growth that may contribute to that perception.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guthman&#8217;s team also found that the next generation of alternative proteins, which are being engineered at the molecular level, often use narratives about global need and inherent nutritional benefit to advocate that the molecular building blocks of protein can be derived from any source material, including those not traditionally thought of as food. Guthman says this illustrates how edibility is both physically and socially constructed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The sector is trying to convince people that these novel proteins will be food largely by making nutritional equivalences that, because it&#8217;s protein, it must be food,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But proteins are ubiquitous in the environment in many forms that are not necessarily food, and it&#8217;s not known yet if some of this stuff will actually be digestible.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Broadening the solutions conversation</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guthman theorizes that companies in Silicon Valley may be drawn to some of these narratives around protein in part because their business models rely on venture capital, and investors are looking for both profitability and world-changing impact on short timelines. But as alternative protein products successfully capture public attention, other solutions may be overlooked.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Guthman says many people already get plenty of protein in their diets and could opt to eat less animal products without negative nutritional impact. Plants also provide abundant, ready-made forms of protein, without the need for heavy processing. And the livestock industry could be better regulated to improve animal welfare and reduce environmental impacts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are a lot of other questions around protein that are regulatory or socioeconomic in nature that have been just outside of the conversation in this haste to develop new technologies,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guthman also worries about the environmental impact of alternative proteins themselves. While many products are portrayed as being inherently beneficial compared with livestock production, Guthman says the details of production processes for alternative proteins are often patented trade secrets, which can prevent independent evaluation of their environmental merits.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We don't often get to hear details about what products or crops or energy or other inputs go into these alternative proteins, where those things are going to come from and under what conditions, nor where the waste from that process will go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s magic. But something doesn't really come from nothing. And we have no way of evaluating it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Guthman says she doesn&#8217;t think investment in alternative protein is necessarily harmful, but she would like to see more transparency in the process and a similar level of societal interest applied to existing methods for producing food with fewer toxic inputs, more humane conditions for animals, and better soil practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The tech sector is kind of like this new kid on the block that comes along and says, &#8216;We&#8217;re here to save the food system,&#8217;&#8221; Guthman said. &#8220;And there&#8217;s no doubt that we do need to seriously rethink how we produce food. But I also want people to understand that these aren&#8217;t the only answers. There are existing solutions and alternatives that could really use the kind of resources that the tech sector is now getting.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="faff87ff80727046264adab2196463d4"><name>velasco-moore-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Physicist Jairo Velasco Jr. wins $1.25 million award from Moore Foundation</title><summary>The Moore Foundation’s Experimental Physics Investigators Initiative supports outstanding U.S. experimental physicists pursuing transformative research.</summary><start-date>1666882800000</start-date><display-name>Physicist Jairo Velasco Jr. wins $1.25 million award from Moore Foundation</display-name><path>/2022/10/velasco-moore-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/velasco-moore-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1666363394022</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1666883178524</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/jairo-velasco-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/jairo-velasco-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jairo-velasco-400.jpg</name><display-name>jairo-velasco-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>100538</file-size><width>400</width><height>449</height></image><image-alt>Jairo Velasco</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/jairo-velasco-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/jairo-velasco-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jairo-velasco-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jairo-velasco-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15247</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jairo Velasco</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jairo Velasco Jr. (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The Moore Foundation’s Experimental Physics Investigators Initiative supports outstanding U.S. experimental physicists pursuing transformative research </article-subhead><article-text><p>Jairo Velasco Jr., associate professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, will receive $1.25 million over the next five years from the <a href="https://www.moore.org/home">Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</a> to advance his research in experimental physics and quantum information science.</p>
<p>Velasco studies the novel physical properties of atomically thin materials known as two-dimensional (2D) materials. Defects or imperfections in the atomic structure of 2D materials have properties that are potentially useful for the development of quantum information technologies, such as quantum computers, which encode information as quantum bits (qubits). One promising avenue for creating qubits is through the manipulation of spin, an intrinsic quantum property of electrons and other particles which causes them to act like tiny magnets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The spins hosted by point defects in 2D materials are a promising platform for future quantum information processing hardware, which operates under distinct principles compared to our existing technology,&#8221; Velasco said. &#8220;Enhancing fundamental understanding of this potential platform may enable new computers and sensors with unprecedented speed, sensitivity, and functionalities.&#8221;</p>
<p>In previous work, Velasco&#8217;s lab has made important contributions in characterizing quantum states in 2D materials, including the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/11/quantum-dots.html">first direct visualization of quantum dots in bilayer graphene</a>.</p>
<p>The Moore Foundation funding will enable Velasco to expand his research on quantum systems in order to characterize their dynamic properties. In particular, he wants to measure the lifetimes of quantum states (the spin relaxation and decoherence time) hosted by point defects. Using cutting-edge, flexible tools with atomic-scale spatial resolution and high energetic precision, Velasco&#8217;s lab will be working to determine the identity of individual defects in 2D materials and to characterize their spin dynamics.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is crucial knowledge for advancing the viability of 2D point defects as a future quantum information processing platform,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a new direction for my lab, and I&#8217;m very excited to begin probing the dynamics of these systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding will also support Velasco&#8217;s educational activities, including undergraduate and graduate students working in his lab, as well as his work with high school students through programs such as <a href="https://cosmos.ucsc.edu/">COSMOS</a> and <a href="https://sip.ucsc.edu/">SIP</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a good time for students to get involved in quantum information science,&#8221; Velasco said. &#8220;They will learn a lot of fundamental science, as well as skills and training that will position them for employment in this emerging field.&#8221;</p>
<p>Velasco is among 16 U.S. experimental physicists receiving support through the Moore Foundation&#8217;s Experimental Physics Investigators Initiative. These awards provide an opportunity for outstanding scientists to pursue transformative research during a critical time in their careers directly following attainment of tenure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The breadth and scientific audacity of experiments proposed by these individuals is stunning and inspiring,&#8221; said the initiative&#8217;s program director Theodore Hodapp. &#8220;Stunning, as well, is the creativity and capabilities of these scientists.&#8221;</p>
<p>The initiative will also support the work of this and future cohorts by providing equipment grants and by hosting convenings to share new ideas and encourage collaborations. Central to this initiative is supporting the investigators as they strive to make their research groups inclusive and advance equity in their departments.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.moore.org/article-detail?newsUrlName=gordon-and-betty-moore-foundation-announces-first-cohort-of-experimental-physics-investigators</url><title>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation announces first cohort of Experimental Physics Investigators</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fb70e87980727046473f5b45bf359430"><name>acting-avc-shr</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Patricia L.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our 2022-23 winter curtailment will run from Friday, December 23, 2022 through Monday, January 2, 2023. Work is scheduled to resume on Tuesday, January 3, 2023.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">December 23, 26, and 30, 2022 and January 2, 2023 are paid university holidays (if eligibility criteria are met)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">December 27, 28, and 29, 2022 are the three (3) curtailment days</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees may use vacation, accrued compensatory time off (CTO), or take leave without pay (LWOP) for the curtailment days, scheduled for December 27, 28, and 29, 2022. For employees who may not have sufficient accumulated vacation hours, up to three (3) days of vacation leave may be used in advance of actual accrual during the winter curtailment period. Those employees who are normally required to wait six (6) months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their vacation hours even if the required waiting period has not been completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during campus closure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In certain cases staff employees will be required to work during some or all of this period due to the nature of their jobs. Any staff employee, regardless of their work location, including remote work, may work only with the explicit approval of their principal officer/designee and supervisor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Units planning to maintain operations as usual during the winter curtailment period must receive approval from their respective principal officer or designee and should refer to the "Exceptions to Winter Curtailment" memo that will be coming from Physical Plant. This memo will explain the required procedure to ensure that heat is supplied to appropriate working areas. It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise employees to dress appropriately during this time.&#160;</span></p>

The sold-out event included UC Santa Cruz students, faculty, staff, and alumni, community members, dignitaries and several members of Huerta&#8217;s family. Huerta delivered a resounding speech that included leading the crowd of more than 200 people in a joyous chant of &#8220;S&#237;, se puede,&#8221; her famous mantra that has become synonymous with Latinx pride, power, and hope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huerta praised the impact of the research center that will bear her name, which is the first of its kind in the UC system to combine perspectives from the fields of Latinx ethnic studies and Latin American area studies to focus on the experiences of Latinx people in the United States and the social, political, economic, and environmental forces shaping Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the students coming to the center, and with papers that will be published here, I know that we will be able to change history, and make history, and make the world a better place,&#8221; Huerta said, calling the group to action.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event kicked off with a reception, followed by a live performance from student musical group &#8203;&#8203;Mariachi Eterno de UCSC. The main program, which honored Huerta, celebrated the research center&#8217;s 30th anniversary, and featured a powerful keynote speech by community organizer Cristina Jim&#233;nez, co-founder of United We Dream, commenced shortly after 6 p.m. and was livestreamed for viewers around the world. Afterward, Grupo Folkl&#243;rico Los Mejicas gave a special dance performance, then the celebration continued into the night with desserts, music and dancing, and a photo booth.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive opened the evening&#8217;s proceedings, and as she announced the renaming of the center, the audience cheered enthusiastically in recognition of Dolores Huerta.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huerta is the founder and president of the Dolores Huerta Foundation. In 1962, she co-founded the United Farm Workers with Cesar Chavez. She has spent more than 60 years leading community organizing and lobbying efforts to address issues like labor rights, gender discrimination, voter registration, education reform, LGBTQ rights, and economic inequality on behalf of farm workers, immigrants, women, youth, and others in California and the United States. Huerta&#8217;s legacy has long guided the work and values of the newly renamed </span><a href="https://rca.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center&#8217;s programs and research initiatives study many of the same topics that Huerta has dedicated her life to, shedding new light on how these issues manifest today in Latinx communities across the U.S. and Latin America. The center focuses on applying its research insights to support social change work. Huerta also shares the center and UCSC&#8217;s focus on student empowerment and success. She has a background as an educator, is a former UC Regent, and advocates for educational equity through the Dolores Huerta Foundation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The naming of the Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americans recognizes Huerta&#8217;s impact as a pathbreaking leader in all of these areas, reaffirms the center&#8217;s commitment to the values she embodies, and dedicates the center&#8217;s future work in her honor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am certain that UC Santa Cruz students&#8212;the next generation of change makers&#8212;will be inspired by Huerta for many years to come,&#8221; said UCSC&#160;<span>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</span>&#160;in her opening remarks.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Professor Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, director of the Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas, took to the stage during the event to share background on the center&#8217;s mission, history, and programs, including its work to mentor students and provide a supportive community. Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell also celebrated this aspect of the center&#8217;s work in her opening remarks.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Both the center&#8217;s research impact and its focus on student engagement and mentorship demonstrate a deep commitment to many of our values in the Division of Social Sciences,&#8221; Mitchell said, &#8220;particularly inclusion and ensuring our diverse student population is increasingly able to recognize itself in our faculty, our staff, and our overall institutions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas is affiliated with both the Division of Social Sciences and the Latin American and Latino Studies (LALS) Department, and in the weeks leading up to the event, LALS students shared what the center&#8217;s naming meant to them.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"For Latino students, especially for first-generation or undocumented students and for those of us in the LALS department, this renaming will bring an important empowering and hopeful message about what we can achieve as we keep fighting for human rights and social justice," said Anais Mendoza Rosekrans, an undergraduate who conducts research with the Human Rights Investigations Lab at the Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I was younger and first heard about Dolores Huerta, I wanted to be just like her,&#8221; added first-year LALS student Sofia Trigueros Ufford. &#8220;Before learning about her, I didn't know any other Latinas that were political activists fighting for human rights. I didn't think that was an option for my life. Spreading [Huerta&#8217;s] name and the work she did can inspire other young girls to be powerful and stand up for what they believe in."&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the event, center director Sylvanna Falc&#243;n shared the story of how the naming came to be. For many years, Huerta&#8217;s name had, &#8220;kept coming up as someone who inspired us at the research center,&#8221; Falc&#243;n said. The stars finally aligned when UCSC alumnus Peter Bratt, who directed the award-winning documentary &#8220;Dolores,&#8221; helped put the research center in touch with Huerta to get approval for the naming. Then, starting with $50,000 in matching funds donated by The Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation, the center embarked on a </span><a href="https://crowdfund.ucsc.edu/project/33156"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crowdfunding campaign&#160;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that raised $119,000 to strengthen and expand the center&#8217;s programs in alignment with Huerta&#8217;s legacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are from the grassroots up,&#8221; Falc&#243;n said of the center&#8217;s naming during her remarks at the event. &#8220;...we sent a public message that anyone could become a donor, anyone could show their support for honoring Dolores Huerta at the University of California, and that this naming belongs to the community.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falc&#243;n and Associate Professor of Latin American and Latino Studies Gabriela F. Arredondo delivered a moving tribute to Huerta&#8217;s life and impact during the event. U.S. Senator Alex Padilla and UC Santa Cruz Distinguished Professor Emerita Angela Davis&#8212;a longtime friend of Huerta&#8217;s and fellow civil rights and feminist leader&#8212;both sent their congratulations via video, and California State Senate Majority Leader Emeritus Bill Monning sent his remarks via a letter that was read aloud at the event.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huerta was also honored with a proclamation from Third District Supervisor of Santa Cruz County Ryan Coonerty, declaring October 20th to be &#8220;Dolores Huerta Day&#8221; in the County of Santa Cruz, and was awarded a key to the City of Santa Cruz by Mayor Sonja Brunner, who also issued a proclamation celebrating the center&#8217;s 30th anniversary. California State Senator John Laird presented a joint resolution with Assemblymember Mark Stone and Assemblymember Robert Rivas, recognizing both Huerta and the research center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huerta took to the stage amidst a standing ovation. She opened her remarks by saying with a chuckle that all the praise was &#8220;a little overwhelming,&#8221; then she thanked everyone in attendance and those who had helped to make the event possible. She also shared her thoughts about the importance of the center&#8217;s work in educating the public on the contributions of Latin American people to society. Specifically, she said Europe and the United States owe Latin America a debt for all the wealth extracted from the region over the years, and she discussed aspects of Indigenous and Afro Latino culture that have spread around the globe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hopefully the center can get some of those truths out to people, not just for knowledge or to study, but to change policy,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huerta called on the audience to help &#8220;make history&#8221; by working together to organize for social change and reminding people of the importance of exercising their right to vote. Keynote speaker Cristina Jim&#233;nez&#8217;s address, titled &#8220;We Are Powerful Beyond Numbers,&#8221;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">also carried forward that theme of collective power. Jim&#233;nez is the Co-Founder and former Executive Director of United We Dream (UWD), the largest immigrant youth-led organization in the country, and was instrumental in a successful campaign for President Obama to sign Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the day, Jim&#233;nez met privately with a group of UC Santa Cruz students, including some who have benefited from DACA and those who were interested in forming a UWD chapter on campus. During the event, Jim&#233;nez discussed her own experiences of migrating to the U.S. from Ecuador with her family at the age of 13 and growing up undocumented. Jim&#233;nez told the audience that despite recent setbacks in immigrants&#8217; rights and a political climate that &#8220;can feel heavy,&#8221; she strongly believes that, &#8220;we have the power to create a country where all of us can live with dignity and thrive.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in building that brighter future together, the Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas can play an important role for years to come.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We all have the power to hold institutions accountable and open and close doors,&#8221; Jim&#233;nez said. &#8220;This center was born to create a door. Now it has been renamed to honor a leader of our community, and it will continue to create safe spaces for our community. This is the type of institution we should invest in and support.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0c12dd4e807270467dc78b1170d7b95c"><name>jeff-weekley</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>On the intersection of machines and media: Silver Slug Award helps career staff pursue life-long passion</title><summary>Silver Slug Award recipient and UCSC staff Jeffrey Weekley re-ignites his passion with computational media and pursues his Ph.D. debt-free.  </summary><start-date>1666620000000</start-date><display-name>jeff-weekley</display-name><path>/2022/10/jeff-weekley</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/jeff-weekley</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1666649873716</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1666649873716</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computational Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Bayan Parrenas Shimizu</name><title></title><phone/><email>bpshimiz@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/jefferey-weekelylead1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/jefferey-weekelylead1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jefferey-weekelylead1.jpg</name><display-name>jefferey-weekelylead.jpg</display-name><file-size>160170</file-size><width>400</width><height>532</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/jefferey-weekelythumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/jefferey-weekelythumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jefferey-weekelythumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>jefferey-weekelythumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>13784</file-size><width>79</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silver Slug Award recipient Jeffrey Weekley (Ph.D., computational media &#8217;23).</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/jeff-weekelysecond.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/jeff-weekelysecond.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jeff-weekelysecond.jpg</name><display-name>jeff-weekelysecond.jpg</display-name><file-size>128868</file-size><width>400</width><height>474</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Retirees Association presents the Silver Slug Award to UCSC career staff or dependents of career staff who are pursuing a degree at the university.</span></p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>UCSC career staff Jeffrey Weekley pursues his Ph.D. in computational media debt-free with the help of the Retirees Association’s Silver Slug Award
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After three years with UC Santa Cruz as a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">team lead of IT Research Engagement and Support and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly three decades of professional experience, Jeffrey Weekley (Ph.D., computational media &#8217;23</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is pursuing a lifelong passion as he works towards his Ph.D. at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><strong>With the help of the </strong><a href="https://retirees.ucsc.edu/scholarships/silverslugaward/index.html"><strong>Silver Slug Award</strong></a><strong>&#8212;sponsored by UCSC&#8217;s Retirees Association&#8212;Weekley is pursuing his doctoral degree debt-free.&#160;&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This scholarship means that I don&#8217;t have to take out a student loan, I don&#8217;t have to make any other sort of big sacrifices per quarter, and I can afford to pay the remainder of my tuition out of pocket,&#8221; Weekley said. &#8220;This really helps.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Retirees Association presents the Silver Slug Award to UCSC career staff or dependents of career staff who are pursuing a degree at the university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekley&#8217;s schedule consists of a full-time job, his responsibilities as a part-time doctoral student, attending conferences, and furthering his projects in computational media. Weekley was unaware that applying for a scholarship was a possibility, until one of his professors spoke to him about the Silver Slug Award. The Silver Slug Award is his first academic scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I'd never even stopped to consider whether or not I could get a scholarship,&#8221; Weekley said. &#8220;A lot of my professors, when they heard that I'm paying the tuition myself, would say &#8216;what, that's crazy!&#8217; Somebody said to me that there's a specific scholarship just for staff I should apply for, and I got the award.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With his newfound financial backing, Weekley is eager to dive further into his computational media studies. His work aims to improve scientific communication through narratives in stories and games and create media that provides communication tools for special populations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekley hopes his work will bridge the gap between scientists and the general public and fix the communication divide that often arises for those with special needs that are often neglected, from those with dyslexia to adults or children with learning disabilities.&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Re-igniting a passion&#160;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekley earned his B.A. in media and communications from the University of Northern Iowa in 1988 and his master&#8217;s in computer science at the United States Naval Postgraduate School. He joined UC Santa Cruz with almost three decades of professional experience. His work directly intersected media, communications, 3D modeling, and visualization but for the majority of his career, there wasn&#8217;t a title that defined his area of expertise.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was never really studying computer science,&#8221; Weekley said. &#8220;Making models is a lot like drawing, it's very artistic. I just sort of existed in this world feeling like a square peg in a round hole: I called myself a computer scientist, but I didn't really feel like a computer scientist.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unfamiliarity with the computational media field in the &#8217;90s led Weekley to feel stagnant in his career progression&#8212;up until a chance encounter with Katherine Isbister of UCSC&#8217;s computational media department.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekley met Isbister at a conference at UCSC Extension, where she explained the computational media field, an area existing at the intersection of computer science, game design, media communication, and engineering. Weekley left the conference with a new perspective on the work he spent the last 20 years of his life and a new understanding of how to classify his own professional identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a revelation,&#8221; Weekley said. &#8220;I finally realized that this is what I&#8217;ve been doing all these years&#8212;I am a computational media person.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After many years searching for the label to best describe his goals, Weekley is proud to wear the title of computational media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s an element to computational media particularly situated at UC Santa Cruz, and that&#8217;s the idea of social purpose,&#8221; Weekley said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not just making technology for technology&#8217;s sake: we&#8217;re really trying to look at societal problems and find ways to contribute to a solution.&#8221;</span></p>

Students have saved $79,861 on textbooks and course materials in fall quarter alone, and $150,961 since the initial launch in spring.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Led by the growing preference among students and faculty for digital textbooks and course materials, rental textbooks, and access to Open Educational Resources (OER), UCSC pursued this partnership to provide for the evolving needs of the student body and faculty. Thanks to negotiated savings, UCSC students receive the lowest prices on textbooks and course materials.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to reduced costs, an exciting new need-based scholarship program available to students will provide funds towards textbooks and course materials&#8212;with a total of $20,000 per year allocated and awarded between all students. "The Bay Tree Campus Store is thrilled to partner with Financial Aid, University Library Services, and Akademos to award these financial scholarships to deserving undergraduate and graduate students,&#8221; says Doug Lang, Director of the Campus Store. &#8220;We are so fortunate to work with these organizations in strong support of our students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akademos also supports an online Marketplace that allows for peer-to-peer selling, and reseller pricing on new and used titles. Other benefits for UCSC students include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalized landing pages displaying all required and recommended materials for registered courses in one spot</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An extensive supply of new, used, and rental options&#8212;more than any individual bookstore could offer</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased access to digital materials and OER</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free shipping on qualifying orders over $49, excluding Marketplace purchases</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty and staff are also seeing benefits from the partnership&#8212;robust search and review capabilities and real-time pricing and availability indicators are making the process of selecting materials easier and more efficient. Instructors have the ability to see pricing as they select their materials, and can preview courses to see final student pricing and format options before it goes in front of students via their portal. A dedicated Course Material Strategist is available at the Bay Tree Campus Store to provide assistance as needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming year, the Campus Store will continue to evaluate the new virtual store and implement improvements to provide the lowest cost options to all students. The launch of Inclusive Access will provide faculty members with new tools and features to engage with students and improve learning outcomes. Inclusive Access will also give students immediate access to materials and further reduce coursebook costs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The addition of Equitable Access options will also be explored, and the Campus Store will continue to partner and learn with other UC campuses where these programs have been very successful. Ongoing collaboration with the University Library will focus on implementing programs that help ensure all students have access to savings on textbooks and course materials.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0f4284f5807270467dc78b1160129ffa"><name>vcfoa-interviews</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Visits set for Vice Chancellor for Finance, Operations and Administration finalists</title><summary>Beginning Nov. 2 and continuing until Nov. 15, campus will conduct final in-person interviews in the search for the Vice Chancellor for Finance, Operations and Administration.</summary><start-date>1666681200000</start-date><path>/2022/10/vcfoa-interviews</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/vcfoa-interviews</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1666703328480</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1666720008550</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning Nov. 2 and continuing until Nov. 15, campus will conduct final in-person interviews in the search for the Vice Chancellor for Finance, Operations and Administration. Campus leadership invites all in the UC Santa Cruz community to participate in the process and to provide feedback on the four finalists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each finalist will be on campus for two days, meeting with campus constituencies. During their visit, each finalist will give a 30- to 40-minute public town-hall talk, which will be followed by a 40- to 50-minute moderated Q&amp;A. Remote attendees will be able to ask questions in real time via chat. All UCSC faculty, staff and students are invited to attend these talks.&#160;</span></p>

The 15th annual screening, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the Story</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, presents the premiere of new Masters of Fine Arts thesis documentaries by 2021 and 2022 graduating students in the field of social documentary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only program of its kind in the UC system, the SocDoc MFA, founded in 2005, is a unique degree designed to train media makers committed to social change and to documenting communities, cultures, issues, and individuals who are marginalized in the current landscapes of representation. It emphasizes ethical practices and meaningful community involvement to explore urgent issues through socially engaged documentary practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six films presented this year, each approximately 20 minutes in length, share an interest in contested histories and the footprints of the past, often examined through the lens of personal life experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Futility Season</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hoda Sobhani creates a cinematic letter exchange between herself and her best friend in Iran, Neda, a women&#8217;s rights activist arrested during protests in the same year Sobhani emigrated from Tehran to study at UCSC. During the year Neda was in prison, terrible events occurred in Iran that exacerbated both women&#8217;s difficulties. Sobhani decided to make the documentary after Neda&#8217;s release to give form to their feelings at the time, when they were far from each other and from others who also experienced similar tragedies. Neda has been recently imprisoned again during the current protests in Iran, making this film especially timely and urgent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oana Tenter contributes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday Ended Last Night</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a film that takes a close look at the intersection of politics and religion in the lives of a Romanian-American Christian community in Arizona and weaves a multigenerational portrait of its members. Many in the church came to the U.S. as refugees fleeing the Romanian socialist dictatorship and now live in the Arizona desert as proud right-wing Americans. In the film, Tenter and her colleague, a Romanian journalist, process their reactions, questioning their own relationship with empathy and identity, as they try to understand how their compatriots have embraced the far-right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lara Saab presents </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twirling, Not Spiraling</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The piece draws from research about life along the coasts of Beirut, Lebanon, where Saab is from, and Santa Cruz, where she studies. The film weaves together personal archives, collected memories, dreams, social media content, and recorded video and sound material, reflecting on the sea, the ocean, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recent events such as the catastrophic explosion in Beirut's port area in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chisato Hughes&#8217; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Moons</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an experimental documentary that scavenges for, reframes, and exorcizes evidence concerning the survivors of Humboldt County&#8217;s 1885 Chinese expulsion and the enforced exclusion of Asians in the region for the next 60 years. Born in the county which once boasted it was &#8220;free of Chinamen,&#8221; the filmmaker uses the documentary to pose questions to the ghost of Charlie Moon, the "last Chinese man of Humboldt County," and to interrogate history-making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruth Anne Beutler&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">LAND/TRUST</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explores interrelationships of people, plants, land, and labor as it follows Amah Mutsun Tribal Band members&#8217; work to restore a coastal prairie on California's Central Coast. The film documents the effort to restore the coastal prairie in the Quiroste Valley Cultural Preserve at A&#241;o Nuevo State Park, which encompasses the former site of Mitenne, a village of the Awaswas-speaking Quiroste people. In the absence of known Quiroste descendants, The Amah Mutsun Tribal band is currently stewarding the land and maintaining the memory of the Quiroste ancestors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jordan Freeman&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sea State</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filmed on a boat he sailed by himself on the ocean, is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">visually rich </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">meditation on strategies for survival in a time of convergent crises. He writes, &#8220;Safe passage at sea requires an instinctual understanding that no force exists in isolation, a critical lesson for our survival on land. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sea State</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenges viewers to understand the crises of our world as related through their points of impact. In a world of accelerating and converging crises, from ecological collapse to the rise of fascism, we can no longer treat the threats which we face as separate or sequential."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a program of six very different films by diverse artists, each driven to create stylistically unique work full of nuance, detail, and emotion,&#8221; says Jennifer Maytorena Taylor, Associate Professor, Film &amp; Digital Media and Director of Graduate Studies. &#8220;Made during the pandemic but not made about the pandemic, these films fearlessly explore the effects of upheaval and profound change on individuals, communities, and even the earth itself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The screening will be followed by a live Q&amp;A with the filmmakers. The Del Mar Theatre is located at 1124 Pacific Ave, Santa Cruz, CA.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">En los &#250;ltimos 2 mil a&#241;os, el Salton Sea ha fluctuado entre dos estados: un lago o una cuenca des&#233;rtica seca, probablemente dependiendo del curso del r&#237;o Colorado. Sin embargo, la versi&#243;n actual del lago se cre&#243; a principios de 1900, cuando los canales de riego del r&#237;o Colorado se rompieron temporalmente, derramando una gran cantidad de agua en la cuenca de Salton, que antes estaba seca. Ahora, el Salton Sea es el lago m&#225;s grande de California. Pero ha estado perdiendo volumen desde principios de la d&#233;cada de 2000, debido a la reducci&#243;n de la escorrent&#237;a agr&#237;cola que ingresa al mar a medida que el agua se transfiere a las &#225;reas urbanas en la costa de California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Esta p&#233;rdida de agua ha aumentado la salinidad del Salton Sea a casi el doble de la del agua del oc&#233;ano, lo que ha provocado una disminuci&#243;n de las poblaciones de peces y aves. El volumen cada vez m&#225;s reducido del lago tambi&#233;n ha expuesto partes de la costa anteriormente sumergidas, llamadas playa. Los vientos que azotan la playa seca levantan part&#237;culas de polvo que pueden empeorar la calidad del aire local y contribuir a las altas tasas de enfermedades respiratorias en las comunidades vecinas principalmente latinas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">La situaci&#243;n ha seguido empeorando durante varias d&#233;cadas, en parte porque los m&#233;todos de restauraci&#243;n apropiados para la laguna son dif&#237;ciles de identificar e implementar, y las propuestas suelen ser costosas y pol&#233;micas. En 2021, el Programa de Gesti&#243;n del Salton Sea del Estado de California (SSMP) otorg&#243; un contrato a la Universidad de California, Santa Cruz, para evaluar una forma particular de estrategia de restauraci&#243;n: conceptos de importaci&#243;n de agua para rellenar la laguna. El profesor de estudios ambientales Brent Haddad fue el investigador principal de este proyecto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He estado estudiando la gesti&#243;n del agua y la gobernabilidad del agua durante la mayor parte de mi carrera y he estado involucrado en muchos proyectos grandes, pero ninguno tan complejo y trascendental como este&#8221;, dijo Haddad. &#8220;El Salton Sea es un desaf&#237;o que involucra todos los aspectos de la gesti&#243;n del agua, desde la ingenier&#237;a hasta la gobernanza, la ecolog&#237;a, la econom&#237;a y la salud p&#250;blica&#8221;, a&#241;adi&#243;.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluaci&#243;n de los conceptos de importaci&#243;n de agua</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Para abordar la cuesti&#243;n espec&#237;fica de si era factible importar suficiente agua de la costa del Pac&#237;fico de California, el r&#237;o Colorado o el Mar de Cort&#233;s de M&#233;xico para volver a llenar el Salton Sea, Haddad estableci&#243; un Panel de Revisi&#243;n Independiente para asesorar al estado. El panel estuvo presidido por Rominder Suri, profesor y catedr&#225;tico de Ingenier&#237;a Civil y Ambiental de la Universidad de Temple, y estuvo integrado por siete expertos en diferentes aspectos de la restauraci&#243;n de cuerpos de agua, incluidos ingenier&#237;a, ecolog&#237;a, econom&#237;a, biogeoqu&#237;mica y leyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adina Paytan, cient&#237;fica investigadora y profesora del Instituto de Ciencias Marinas de la UCSC particip&#243; en el panel. Haddad no era miembro del panel. En cambio, supervis&#243; el equipo administrativo y de investigaci&#243;n, incluidos los profesores de la UCSC Yihsu Chen y Michael Loik, los estudiantes graduados Daniel Hastings, Hannah Newburn, Sepehr Ramyar, Prem Patel, Charlie Chesney y Siyu Luo, la coordinadora del proyecto Azucena Beltran y personal Instituto de Transformaci&#243;n Social de la Universidad de California en Santa Cruz que apoy&#243; el trabajo del panel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El panel evalu&#243; 18 ideas espec&#237;ficas para la importaci&#243;n de agua que fueron presentadas por el p&#250;blico durante dos Solicitudes de informaci&#243;n en 2018 y 2021. De estas, tres enfoques evitaron un conjunto de cinco &#8220;fallas fatales&#8221; que los miembros del Panel acordaron que ning&#250;n enfoque viable para la importaci&#243;n de agua deber&#237;a tener. Los tres enfoques sin fallas fatales, que implican extraer agua del Mar de Cort&#233;s, se combinaron luego en un Concepto de Importaci&#243;n del Mar de Cort&#233;s que se someti&#243; a un estudio de factibilidad detallado, que incluy&#243; an&#225;lisis de costos, permisos, ingenier&#237;a, geot&#233;cnicos y beneficios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Este estudio de factibilidad mostr&#243; que, si bien el concepto del Mar de Cort&#233;s era te&#243;ricamente posible desde una perspectiva de ingenier&#237;a, era extremadamente costoso, implicaba un riesgo significativo de da&#241;o ambiental, llevar&#237;a d&#233;cadas completarlo y brindaba beneficios limitados a M&#233;xico. Como resultado, hab&#237;a un gran potencial de que los beneficios deseados para Salton Sea se retrasar&#237;an mucho o nunca se realizar&#225;n. El informe final del panel no recomend&#243; que el estado procediera con ninguno de los conceptos de importaci&#243;n de agua propuestos inicialmente. Haddad dijo creer que el panel tom&#243; una decisi&#243;n s&#243;lida y basada en evidencia sobre este asunto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Creo que esto nos saca de un camino potencialmente catastr&#243;fico desde el punto de vista financiero, en el que podr&#237;amos habernos quedado atrapados tratando de construir un canal para siempre, sin producir una gota de agua para el Salton Sea&#8221;, explic&#243;. &#8220;Cada a&#241;o, la salinidad del lago crece y se expone m&#225;s playa, lo que hace que el desaf&#237;o sea mucho m&#225;s dif&#237;cil. As&#237; que la velocidad es esencial&#8221;, afirm&#243;.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recomendando alternativas</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A medida que el panel evalu&#243; la factibilidad de rellenar el Salton Sea a trav&#233;s del Concepto de Importaci&#243;n del Mar de Cort&#233;s, tambi&#233;n identificaron otros dos posibles enfoques de restauraci&#243;n, que se sometieron al mismo estudio de factibilidad. Los tres enfoques propusieron una gran instalaci&#243;n de desalinizaci&#243;n en Salton Sea. El exceso de sal producido en el proceso ser&#237;a transportado y eliminado en vertederos fuera del sitio a trav&#233;s de las l&#237;neas de ferrocarril existentes. Los dos conceptos adicionales propon&#237;an la importaci&#243;n de agua solo en los niveles necesarios para reemplazar la cantidad de agua perdida en el proceso de desalinizaci&#243;n. Estos conceptos inclu&#237;an planes para expandir los proyectos de estabilizaci&#243;n de playas en curso para minimizar los impactos relacionados con el polvo en la calidad del aire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estos enfoques adicionales se consideraron porque el panel concluy&#243; que hab&#237;a pruebas s&#243;lidas de investigaci&#243;n que suger&#237;an que los objetivos ambientales, econ&#243;micos y de calidad del aire para la regi&#243;n se pod&#237;an lograr manteniendo el Salton Sea en un volumen m&#225;s bajo que los niveles de mediados a finales del siglo 20. La estabilizaci&#243;n del Salton Sea en un nuevo tama&#241;o m&#225;s peque&#241;o evitar&#237;a el da&#241;o ambiental y el alto costo que resultar&#237;a de intentar rellenar totalmente el mar, y los beneficios podr&#237;an materializarse antes y ser m&#225;s sostenibles a largo plazo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Este proyecto realmente requiere pensar en el agua de una manera muy amplia y hol&#237;stica, porque estamos en medio de una sequ&#237;a que probablemente empeore, y cualquier agua que vaya al Salton Sea ser&#225; agua que faltar&#225; en otros lugares&#8221;, asegur&#243; Adina Paytan, miembro del panel. &#8220;Entonces, si es posible resolver los problemas de contaminaci&#243;n del aire y mejorar la salud del ecosistema sin tener que mantener un cuerpo de agua tan grande en el desierto, esa es una situaci&#243;n en la que todos ganan,&#8221; a&#241;adi&#243;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uno de los dos enfoques que el panel consider&#243; para restaurar un Salton Sea m&#225;s peque&#241;o propuso reemplazar el agua perdida por la desalinizaci&#243;n con agua agr&#237;cola del r&#237;o Colorado, a trav&#233;s de un programa de transferencia voluntaria. Este plan, denominado Concepto de Transferencia Voluntaria del R&#237;o Colorado, se bas&#243; en programas exitosos recientes llevados a cabo por el Distrito de Irrigaci&#243;n de Imperial (IID), en los que se pag&#243; a los agricultores de California para que dejaran en barbecho sus campos, liberando as&#237; agua para fluir hacia Salton Sea. Tambi&#233;n se debe estudiar la conversi&#243;n de pr&#225;cticas agr&#237;colas a cultivos y tecnolog&#237;as m&#225;s eficientes en el uso del agua o la expansi&#243;n del programa voluntario de agua o los programas de intercambio de agua a &#225;reas urbanas, seg&#250;n las recomendaciones del panel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Con base en los hallazgos del estudio de factibilidad, el panel determin&#243; que el Concepto de Transferencia Voluntaria del R&#237;o Colorado, aunque desafiante, era factible en general. Como resultado, lo est&#225;n recomendando al estado. El panel estima que este plan permitir&#237;a que el nivel de salinidad del Salton Sea volviera a la salinidad aproximada del nivel del oc&#233;ano tan pronto como en 2051, y el nivel de equilibrio final del agua del Salton Sea descansar&#237;a aproximadamente a 258 pies por debajo del nivel medio del mar.</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los miembros del equipo de la Universidad de California en Santa Cruz que apoyaron el trabajo del panel esperan que las recomendaciones del proyecto brinden claridad y puedan ayudar a impulsar el progreso en la restauraci&#243;n. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uno de los grandes desaf&#237;os con la restauraci&#243;n del Salton Sea es que hay muchas maneras de hacerlo mal, y lo que est&#225; en juego es que la poblaci&#243;n local ha estado esperando durante d&#233;cadas para saber qu&#233; suceder&#225; con esta caracter&#237;stica tan importante en su regi&#243;n&#8221;, consider&#243; Haddad. &#8220;Un plan factible y rentable que pudiera restaurar los beneficios ambientales y minimizar la contribuci&#243;n del Salton Sea a los problemas de calidad del aire realmente podr&#237;a ayudar a la regi&#243;n a avanzar&#8221;, explic&#243; el especialista.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lo largo del proceso, el panel y los miembros del equipo de investigaci&#243;n buscaron aportes de las comunidades locales para comprender mejor los problemas que enfrenta la regi&#243;n y realizaron viajes de campo para visitar el Salton Sea y el norte de M&#233;xico. La coordinadora del proyecto, Azucena Beltr&#225;n, una exalumna de la UCSC que creci&#243; en la regi&#243;n del Salton Sea, ayud&#243; a garantizar que todos los procesos de participaci&#243;n p&#250;blica fueran accesibles para las comunidades de habla hispana. Las comunicaciones clave del proyecto se tradujeron al espa&#241;ol y las reuniones p&#250;blicas se estructuraron como conversaciones biling&#252;es interpretadas, seguidas de sesiones de preguntas y respuestas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El equipo espera que estas pr&#225;cticas puedan ofrecer un modelo para el futuro trabajo de participaci&#243;n p&#250;blica en Salton Sea, para garantizar que se escuchen las voces de las comunidades locales. Beltr&#225;n dijo que es probable que las comunidades tarden alg&#250;n tiempo en digerir los &#250;ltimos informes del Panel de Revisi&#243;n Independiente, pero los hallazgos ya est&#225;n estimulando una conversaci&#243;n productiva.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Durante tanto tiempo, todo lo que escuchamos como miembros de la comunidad fue que el mar era la raz&#243;n de la mala calidad del aire y que la &#250;nica soluci&#243;n de la que se hablaba era la importaci&#243;n de agua, as&#237; que personalmente, me alivia saber que hay otras opciones que podr&#237;a ser menos costoso y tener el mismo efecto,&#8221; dijo. &#8220;Hace que la restauraci&#243;n se sienta m&#225;s realista y factible. Para m&#237;, una restauraci&#243;n exitosa de Salton Sea es aquella en la que tanto la salud p&#250;blica como los aspectos ecol&#243;gicos se abordan de una manera que sea sostenible en los a&#241;os que est&#225;n por venir,&#8221; concluy&#243;.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="154df6118072704655f5a9ede8376637"><name>trethewey</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Acclaimed poet and bestselling memoirist Natasha Trethewey is guest of honor at the Morton Marcus Memorial Poetry Reading on November 3. </title><summary>Acclaimed poet Natasha Trethewey, author of the bestselling memoir Memorial Drive, is this year's distinguished speaker at the 13th annual Morton Marcus Memorial Poetry Reading at UCSC on November 3. </summary><start-date>1666804800000</start-date><display-name>tretheweyadvance</display-name><path>/2022/10/trethewey</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/trethewey</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1666804741627</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1666805860191</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/tretheweybanner.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/tretheweybanner.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tretheweybanner.jpg</name><display-name>tretheweybanner.jpg</display-name><file-size>43252</file-size><width>425</width><height>239</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/tretheweythumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/tretheweythumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tretheweythumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>tretheweythumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>16143</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Natasha Trethewey, author of the bestselling 2020 memoir Memorial Drive: A Daughter’s Memoir, will be sharing her poetry with the Santa Cruz community 
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pulitzer-prize-winning poet, essayist and bestselling memoirist Natasha Trethewey found comfort in verse in the time of her deepest grief.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now she is a passionate advocate of poetry&#8217;s power. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s the way we have to connect not only the intellect but also the heart, to engage the whole body with breath, with rhythm,&#8221; she told </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poets &amp; Writers.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trethewey, who served as the 19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Poet Laureate of the United States, will be the honored guest speaker at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual Morton Marcus Poetry Reading at 6 p.m. on Thursday, November 3, at the Merrill College Cultural Center at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poetry reading is presented by The Humanities Institute at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event is free and open to the public but </span><a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=4378&amp;cid=9567"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advance registration is required</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reading series honors the life and work of poet, author, teacher, film critic, and activist for the arts </span><a href="https://www.mortonmarcus.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morton Marcus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1936&#8211;2009). A longtime Santa Cruz resident, Marcus was strongly associated with the Central Coast literary community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poet and artist Gary Young will host the program. The evening will include an announcement of the winner of the Morton Marcus Poetry Contest. The recipient receives a $1,000 prize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This year&#8217;s Morton March Poetry Reading is the 13th in the series, and this year&#8217;s poet, Natasha Trethewey, continues our mission to bring the finest poets working in America to UCSC and to the greater Santa Cruz Community,&#8221; said Young, a continuing lecturer at UCSC and director of the Cowell Press.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I've been reading and teaching Trethewey&#8217;s poems since her second book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bellocq&#8217;s Ophelia, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">came out some twenty years ago,&#8221; Young continued.&#160; &#8220;Her rigorous, inventive intelligence, and the music of her poems mesmerized me then, and still do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This event is a milestone in another respect: it marks a return of in-person poetry readings at UCSC after two years of interruptions because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine a more ferocious, penetrating, and engaging writer than Natasha Trethewey to welcome live readings back to campus and the Morton Marcus Reading series,&#8221; Young said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paris Review</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Trethewey, author of the bestselling memoir </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memorial Drive, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">commemorating the life and murder of her mother, spoke of poetry&#8217;s uncanny power &#8220;to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a sort of opening in time; it feels like there are moments of resurrection that I can live fully inside of, like a memory of my mother that brings her back &#8230; my living mother is with me, too. That&#8217;s the seed planted in the heart which grows and grows.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based writer Mark Ong, who serves on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morton Marcus Poetry Reading's Organizing Committee, and is Morton Marcus&#8217;s literary executor, spoke of Trethewey&#8217;s artistry, balance, focus, and discipline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A good poet is a high-wire artist,&#8221; Ong said. &#8220;They have to walk between past poetry and the distant point of their own work. They have to bridge between the constraints of words and their own creativity. And they have to stand between their own terrors and the healing possibilities of art.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trethewey was a 19-year-old college student when her former stepfather murdered her mother. Trethewey has told interviewers that her life as a poet truly began at that moment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you've read her memoir, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memorial Drive</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you know that she has endured horrific events,&#8221; Ong said. &#8220;Yet she courageously shapes her past into what all poetry must do: give form to the unspeakable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trethewey is the author of five poetry collections, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native Guard </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2006</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for which she was awarded the 2007 Pulitzer Prize; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monument: Poems New and Selected</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2018); </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond Katrina: A Meditation on the Mississippi Gulf Coast</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2010).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trethewey&#8217;s book of nonfiction, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond Katrina: A Meditation on the Mississippi Gulf Coast</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was published in 2010. She is the recipient of fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Beinecke Library at Yale, and the Bunting Fellowship Program of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard. At Northwestern University she is the Board of Trustees Professor of English in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012 she was named Poet Laureate of the State of Mississippi and in 2013 she was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee, who earned a B.S. in Biochemistry and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Molecular Biology from UCSC in March 2022, took full advantage of everything available to her as a Banana Slug.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Coming into UCSC, I was selected as a Campus Merit Scholar, Honors College Scholar, and EOP student,&#8221; she says. &#8220;These resources gave me opportunities to speak with faculty as a freshman and learn about the wide range of courses offered at UCSC. I became eager to pursue a multidisciplinary path.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having grown up in the Bay Area, Lee didn&#8217;t travel a large geographic distance to attend UCSC, but it has been a big, transformative journey in many ways.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Lee knew she was interested in biochemistry from the beginning, her focus on bioinformatics came later. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of my first year, I had gained a deep appreciation of how previous experiments built our understanding of life and the foundation in modern medicine,&#8221; she says. &#8220;However, I was intrigued by questions that remained unanswered, and eager to learn how new techniques could be leveraged to study complex biological systems.&#8221; This led to her exploration of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bioinformatics. &#8220;I wanted to understand how genomic information can reveal potential mechanisms of disease. I became excited to utilize computation and statistics to study how our genotype could affect our phenotype.&#8221;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her last two years at UCSC, she was involved in biochemistry and bioinformatic research which was supported by a variety of donors through these awards and scholarships: Undergraduate Research in Science and Technology Award, Doug Drexler Scholarship, Merrill Student Project, Koret Undergraduate Research Scholarship, Dean&#8217;s and Chancellor&#8217;s Award, and Kenneth and Ann Thimann Scholarship.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thanks to the financial support offered by UCSC, I was able to concurrently conduct research while taking courses,&#8221; Lee says. &#8220;I am grateful for people&#8217;s generosity, which enabled me to apply and get accepted to graduate school.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee is attending UCSF&#8217;s Tetrad program, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">encompasses Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Genetics, and Developmental Biology. She says she chose the program because she wanted to pursue a Ph.D. in life sciences with a wide breadth of disciplines, and is excited to partner with K-12 teachers to co-plan and co-teach investigative science lessons in classrooms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee credits her family for where she is today.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My family has always been the backbone of my journey,&#8221; she says. &#8220;They have given me the support and opportunities to pursue my passion in scientific research. More importantly, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">my mother's story of immigrating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the U.S. after fleeing the Vietnam War and living in a refugee camp has given me the courage and perseverance to be the first in my family to attain a Ph.D.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee says she originally chose to attend UCSC since the university&#8217;s natural and beautiful landscape was the ideal place to pursue life science. Lee is very glad about her decision and says her experiences at UCSC taught her a great deal. Lee wants to share that people should never hesitate to ask questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My academic and research experience has taught me to follow curiosity and learn by being challenged,&#8221; Lee says. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Success comes from support. My growth as a student and researcher came by building relationships with peers, teaching assistants, and faculty. I have learned from others to think from different perspectives and to be creative!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked if she has any </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">advice for current UCSC students, Lee replies, &#8220;Sit in on classes that you are on the fence about. You never know what might spark your interest!&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="19ec84f98072704622cfa2c65aca613a"><name>a-call-for-unity</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>A call for unity; resources for students</title><summary>Over the course of the past several weeks, the Student Union Assembly (SUA) has been mired in a period of great conflict and uncertainty, which has impacted many within the campus community in profound ways. </summary><start-date>1666767600000</start-date><display-name>A call for unity; resources for students</display-name><path>/2022/10/a-call-for-unity</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/a-call-for-unity</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1666882241755</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1666882241755</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>Over the course of the past several weeks, the Student Union Assembly (SUA) has been mired in a period of great conflict and uncertainty, which has impacted many within the campus community in profound ways.

The annual award is the division's highest honor for faculty achievement, recognizing combined excellence in research, teaching, and service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan Costa is an internationally known and widely respected scientist who has made significant contributions both to UCSC and to the broader scientific community. An extraordinary faculty member, he is truly deserving of this award,&#8221; wrote Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, in a letter announcing the award.</p>
<p>Costa is a leading authority on the physiology, ecology, and behavior of large marine vertebrates, including whales, seals, sea lions, and seabirds. He has been a pioneer in the development and use of electronic tags to track the movements and behavior of marine mammals and to gather oceanographic data. The Costa Lab leads the long-running UCSC elephant seal research program at A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve, and his research on marine mammals and seabirds has ranged across the globe, from Monterey Bay to Alaska, Antarctica, Australia, the Galapagos Islands, and other locations.</p>
<p>By facilitating global collaborations and providing new tools and insights into the physiology and ecology of marine mammals, Costa has helped transform research on marine megafauna. His research discoveries have also contributed to timely conservation applications for protecting marine species around the world.</p>
<p>An influential teacher and mentor, Costa teaches one of the most popular upper division biology courses&#8212;<em>Biology of Marine Mammals</em>&#8212;incorporating photos, videos, and audio recordings from his field work into the lectures. Many undergraduates have also been involved in his lab and field work, gaining valuable research experience.</p>
<p>Koch noted that Costa&#8217;s lab has been an important training ground for the next generation of marine scientists. Costa has supervised 25 master&#8217;s students, 39 doctoral students, and 28 postdoctoral scholars&#8212;a diverse group, including women, underrepresented minorities, and international students, many of whom are now in prominent positions around the world.</p>
<p>Costa has served in leadership positions at the campus, national, and international level. As IMS director, he has reorganized its administrative structure, strengthened the relationship between UCSC and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries), and helped develop plans for the UCSC Center for Coastal Climate Resilience. At the systemwide level, Costa served as chair of the UC Natural Reserve System Advisory Committee and was a founding member of the California Cooperative Ecosystems Study Unit. He has served as an adviser for numerous national and international funding agencies, foundations, and academic institutions, and has held leadership positions on large multi-institutional projects and research consortia.</p>
<p>A fellow of the California Academy of Sciences and the Society for Marine Mammalogy, Costa held the Ida Benson Lynn Chair in Ocean Health at UC Santa Cruz from 2008 to 2013. He received the Antarctica Service Medal, and Costa Spur in Antarctica was named in recognition of his contributions to Antarctic research. Costa received his B.A. in biology at UCLA and his Ph.D. in zoology at UCSC. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1991.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1b95e6558072704622cfa2c6b2a47189"><name>open-enrollment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Open Enrollment 2022 for UC faculty, staff starts today</title><summary>University of California’s annual Open Enrollment (OE) period will take place from 8 a.m. October 27 through 5 p.m. on November 18. </summary><start-date>1666854000000</start-date><display-name>Open Enrollment 2022 for UC faculty, staff starts today</display-name><path>/2022/10/open-enrollment</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/open-enrollment</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1666910119484</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1666910119484</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Campus Community,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of California&#8217;s annual Open Enrollment (OE) period will take place from </span><strong>8 a.m. October 27</strong><strong>th</strong><strong> through 5 p.m. on November 18</strong><strong>th</strong><strong>.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most changes made during OE become effective January 1, 2023, with the exception of pet insurance, which is available as soon as Nationwide insurance approves the application. All medical, dental and vision plans will be open for enrollment, as well as Accident, Critical Illness, Hospital Indemnity, Legal and Flexible Spending Accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC is offering the same high-quality health plans as last year. Premium increases ranging from $1 to $87 per month, depending on the medical plan you choose and the family members you cover. There are no changes in costs to employees for Dental or Vision; UC will continue to pay the premiums. Medical plan renewal rates for 2023 are notably higher than previous years due to the pandemic, higher utilization and a variety of other factors. To moderate the impact on employee contributions, UC&#8217;s Executive Steering Committee on Health Benefits approved a one-time increase above the standard increase, providing an estimated $29.5M in additional funding. </span><strong>New and continuing members of UC Blue &amp; Gold are eligible for a discounted rate negotiated exclusively for UC Santa Cruz employees and a one-year premium subsidy is available only for the UC Blue &amp; Gold HMO plan.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This discount rate is the result of the partnership between Dignity Health, Canopy Health and Health Net. Review the special rate sheet in your OE materials or log into </span><a href="https://ucpath.universityofcalifornia.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCPath</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> OE application to view your premium rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC continues to assess medical plan premiums by pay level to ensure costs are affordable, particularly for lower-paid workers. In response to changes in the Consumer Price Index, increases to 2023 salary band tiers will range from $4,000 to $14,000 per band. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">University&#8217;s share</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the total premium cost for employees ranges from a high of 93% to a low of 78%, averaged across plans and salary bands. Including increases to medical plan premiums, there are a few important changes you should know about: (1) enhanced fertility benefits for all UC employee medical plans; (2) for the UC Care, UC Health Savings Plan and CORE medical plans, a health benefits navigator, Accolade, will be implemented in 2023; and (3) new services to be covered under legal insurance.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><strong>deadline</strong><strong> for the end of Open Enrollment: Make your elections by 5:00 p.m. Friday, November 18, 2022. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now is the time to make decisions around your coverage for next year. If you decide that your health and welfare benefits should remain unchanged, your benefits will continue with no action necessary for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">most</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plans. As always, if you want to continue participation in Health and/or Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA&#8217;s), enrollment is required annually during OE</span><strong>.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> All OE elections for faculty &amp; staff will be made via</span><a href="https://ucpath.universityofcalifornia.edu/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">UCPath</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Las tarifas de renovaci&#243;n en los planes M&#233;dicos para el 2023 ser&#225;n notablemente m&#225;s altas que las de a&#241;os anteriores debido a la pandemia, el alza en utilizaci&#243;n y una variedad de otros factores. Para moderar el impacto en las contribuciones del empleado, el Comit&#233; Directivo Ejecutivo de la UC para Beneficios de Salud aprob&#243; un aumento, de una sola vez, por encima del aumento est&#225;ndar, aportando unos $29.5 millones en fondos adicionales. </span><strong>Los miembros nuevos y los continuos de UC Blue &amp; Gold ser&#225;n elegibles para una tarifa con descuento, negociada exclusivamente para los empleados de la UC Santa Cruz y un subsidio de un a&#241;o en la prima estar&#225; disponible solo en el plan HMO Blue &amp; Gold de la UC.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Esta tarifa con descuento se debe al consorcio entre Dignity Health, Canopy Health y Health Net.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">La UC contin&#250;a sopesando las primas de los planes m&#233;dicos, por nivel de paga, a fin de asegurar que los costos sean asequibles, en particular para los empleados que ganen menos. En respuesta a los cambios en el &#205;ndice de Precios al Consumidor, los aumentos en los niveles salariales del 2023 fluctuar&#225;n desde $4,000 a $14,000 seg&#250;n el nivel. El </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">monto que la Universidad comparte</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> del costo total de la prima para los empleados va desde un tope del 93% a un m&#237;nimo del 78%, como promedio entre planes y niveles salariales. Incluyendo los aumentos en las primas de los planes m&#233;dicos, habr&#225; unos pocos cambios importantes que Ud. deber&#225; conocer: (1) mejoras en beneficios de fertilidad para el empleado en todos los planes m&#233;dicos de la UC; (2) para los planes m&#233;dicos de UC Care, el Plan de Ahorros en Salud de la UC y CORE, en el 2023 se implementar&#225; el navegador de beneficios de salud Accolade; y (3) nuevos servicios quedar&#225;n cubiertos por el seguro legal.</span></p>

William (Bill) Domhoff &#8212;&#160;a distinguished professor emeritus and a research professor at UC Santa Cruz &#8212; first began studying dreams, he had no idea what was in store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domhoff began his career as a founding professor at UC Santa Cruz in 1965, following three years as an assistant professor of psychology at CSU Los Angeles. Now, nearly 62 years since he began studying dreams, Domhoff has developed an updated version of his neurocognitive theory of dreaming, and presented new empirical findings on dream content in his new book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Neurocognitive Theory of Dreaming: The Where, How, When, What, and Why of Dreams, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">released October 4 by MIT Press.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book &#8212;&#160;Domhoff&#8217;s fifth focused on dreams &#8212;&#160;takes a comprehensive look at the full use of neuroimaging findings in relation to spontaneous thought and dream content. Domhoff now believes there are five separate issues in terms of understanding dreams: neural substrates, cognitive processes, the psychological meaning of dream content, evolutionarily adaptive functions, and historically invented cultural uses. In addition, due to research by others in the 1980s and 1990s, Domhoff emphasizes there is an important development dimension to dreaming: pre-school children do not dream often, and their dreams are not very complex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dreaming, he says, is therefore a gradual cognitive achievement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domhoff discussed his original dive into dream studies, the changes over time, and the major discoveries in the 1990s that led to his neurocognitive theory of dreaming. His answers have been edited for length and clarity.</span></p>
<p><strong>What originally sparked your interest in dream research and neuroimaging studies?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started out in the late 1950s, early 1960s, at a time when the relationship between rapid eye movement sleep &#8212;&#160;called REM sleep &#8212; and dreaming was first coming to the attention of the scientific community. It was very exciting because the eye movements in REM sleep seemed to be related to what people were dreaming. The eye movements and other changes during REM sleep, such as changes in EEG patterns, therefore provided a seemingly objective indicator of dreaming; there seemed to be a perfect correlation between dreaming and this particular stage of sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that finding soon turned out to be incorrect. People also dream during a state of &#8220;Non-REM&#8221; sleep in the two or so hours before awakening, called &#8220;NREM 2.&#8221; However, we continued to make progress in understanding what we actually dream about through quantitative studies of dream content.</span></p>
<p><strong>What makes a dream a dream?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dreaming is defined in the neurocognitive theory of dreaming as an intensive and enhanced form of mind-wandering and daydreaming, in which dreamers experience themselves in scenarios that almost always include other human beings and/or animals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the other human beings and animals are usually interacting with the dreamer in the context of vivid sensory experiences that usually include seeing and hearing. In fancy terms, dreaming is a form of &#8220;embodied simulation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>What did you find to be the main content of dreams?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People dream most often about their personal concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever&#8217;s happening in the daily environment, no matter how momentous, people nevertheless dream most frequently about family members and friends taking part in social interactions. Dreams more often contain critical and aggressive interactions, as well as misfortunes, such as losing keys or making mistakes, than they include friendly interactions or good fortunes. Dreams have a negativity bias, which has also been found to be the case in waking thought. In that sense, dreams are often worse case scenarios.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>How did you come to develop a neurocognitive theory of dreaming?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two unexpected but important findings in the 1990s led to a revival of interest in dreams. Those two findings also led me to realize it was possible to develop a neurocognitive theory of dreaming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first of those findings was made possible by the development of functional neuroimaging. Functional neuroimaging studies of REM sleep led to the surprising discovery that only certain parts of the brain are active when we are dreaming. This came as a total surprise because everyone had assumed that the whole brain becomes activated during REM sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, and quite independently, a large-scale study showed that lesions in specific areas in the brain lead to either the loss of dreaming, or else to the loss of the visual dimension of dreaming. I soon realized that all of the lesions that led to a loss of dreaming occurred in the neural substrates that were activated during REM sleep, and also in NREM 2 sleep in the hours before morning awakening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly thereafter, a very important finding emerged from waking neuroimaging research. It turns out that the neural network that supports dreaming is part of the waking neural network &#8212; called the default network &#8212;&#160;that supports mind-wandering, daydreaming, and other imaginative forms of thought during waking when the executive and attention networks are relatively deactivated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discovery of the default network made it possible to think of dreaming as one form of spontaneous thought. Furthermore, it was also found that drifting, waking thought and daydreaming, much like dreaming, often involves personal concerns. Thus, there was a considerable continuity in the content of dreaming and waking thought, even though dreaming has many unique features. In effect, dreaming has found a home at long last within a thriving research area within the burgeoning field of neurocognitive psychology.</span></p>
<p><strong>How has your thinking changed about dreams since you first started out 62 years ago?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dreaming and dream content now seem to be very different from what the clinical theories of the first 60 years of the 20th century led us to believe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We find very little or no evidence of symbolism in dreams, and there is far less emotion in everyday dreaming than the clinical theories suggested. Furthermore, the developmental and neuroimaging findings provide a basis for understanding at least some of the differences between dreaming and waking thought.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key new concepts in my new book is that dreaming suffers from various cognitive insufficiencies. I now think that children have fewer and less complex dreams because they do not yet have the cognitive abilities that are necessary to express complex forms of thinking. This view turns out to be consistent with the findings in developmental psychology over the last 45 years, which show the gradual development of mental imagery, narrative thinking, imagination, and an autobiographical self.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These findings fit with the fact that young children do not regularly include themselves in dream scenarios until they are ages 5-7, and their dreams are not fully adultlike in their complexity until ages 9-11. And it is between ages 9-11 that the default network also becomes almost adultlike. As far as dream content, my recent research suggests that it is not adultlike in its content until ages 13-15.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="206874388072704622cfa2c622ad0711"><name>supporting-our-indigenous-community</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>In support of our Indigenous students, faculty and staff</title><summary>Thank you to the students, faculty and staff who have held one another up and built a community for Native American and Indigenous people at UC Santa Cruz.

We learned and are continuing to learn about the harm those words have caused off campus for the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band and at UCSC, an environment that can feel hostile and unwelcoming to Native scholars and students.</span></p>
<p><span>Harmful language devalues the critical support that centers like the AIRC provide, both on our campus and across the country. The AIRC is particularly special because it is the direct result of student and community activism and agency. Throughout its history, the AIRC has maintained an important and close collaborative relationship with the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, who continue to protect and steward the UCSC campus and surrounding lands that are integral to their cultural identity. </span></p>
<p><span>The AIRC is a place that has supported learning, community and most importantly, mutual respect for generations of Native American and Indigenous students, staff, and faculty members. We thank the AIRC Director Angel Riotutar for her leadership and the many staff and students who are honoring this strong legacy and building the future of the AIRC. </span></p>
<p><span>We&#8217;re also grateful to the Indigenous Faculty Network for calling us into the community, sharing their experiences, and moving forward together in partnership to further support educational opportunities about Native Americans on campus. We are looking forward to building increased understanding and respect in the face of recent and ongoing challenges to inclusion. </span></p>
<p><span>Too often we have to write letters of condemnation. Instead, this is a letter of affirmation and gratitude. Thank you to the students, faculty and staff who have held one another up and built a community for Native American and Indigenous people at UC Santa Cruz. No words can undo that work.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lifelong friends and philanthropic partners Peter Coha and James (Jim) Gunderson established the Coha/Gunderson Prize in Speculative Futures in 2020 under <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/">The Humanities Institute (THI)</a>. The competition has since seen seven total prize winners; all awarded a $1000 scholarship.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the Coha/Gunderson Prize in Speculative Futures aims to expand its reach by offering five 2022-2023 prize winners, along with past awardees, the opportunity to participate in The Coha-Gunderson Creativity Workshop, a quarter-long winter workshop followed by a springtime exhibition.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speculative Futures help visualize new and potential worlds. Inspired by art, film, fiction, writings, and more, speculative futures use speculation to imagine what lies ahead based on the present.</span></p>
<p><span>Peter Coha (Kresge &#8217;78, mathematics) was the first to present the idea of a competition in speculative fiction open to all mediums at UCSC and invited his close friend Jim Gunderson (Rachel Carson &#8217;77, philosophy) to help&#160;</span>collaborate and<strong><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>fund the program.</span></p>
<p class="m_-2804519886286394733MsoNoSpacing">&#8220;I thought it would be good to get people thinking about our current situation and environment and presenting what could happen in the future,&#8221; Coha says. &#8220;We could foretell possible outcomes and environments that people might not be thinking about but should be thinking about as possibilities.<u></u><u></u><u></u></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gunderson was excited to hop onto the project.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grew up on speculative futures science fiction and it influenced my own anticipation of accelerating change and trying to look at it from an ethical and societal impact perspective,&#8221; Gunderson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Projects submitted to the Coha/Gunderson Prize in Speculative Futures are delivered across a variety of mediums. Past submissions include written works, artworks, games &amp; playable media,&#160; digitally altered photographs, and more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carla Freccero, Distinguished Professor in the Literature and History of Consciousness departments and head of the Speculative Futures Research Cluster, says the workshop and exhibition aim to allow awardees to flesh out their projects with the help of faculty experts from across the campus. Freccero says that many projects are submitted to the competition as proposals, and with a workshop offered in the winter quarter, students can bring their project proposals to completion.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/cfa-the-coha-gunderson-prize-in-speculative-futures-2022-2023/"><strong>The deadline to apply for this year&#8217;s competition is 11:59 p.m. PST on Nov. 4.&#160;</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How do you get students involved in wanting to solve problems in the world in an imaginative way? That&#8217;s where speculative futures come in,&#8221; Freccero says. &#8220;Speculatively scientific fictions of the future are imaginative ways of thinking about how to solve current world problems, from global warming and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the planet&#8217;s wellbeing to present-day forms of social and political violence.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020-2021 prize winner Aaron Samuel Mulenga submitted two images of a planned installation featuring sculptural, visual and sonic element</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The project focuses on a marriage ritual among the Bemba people of Zambia called Mbusa and aims to explore the effects of African culture and technology on understandings of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mulenga says that the images </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;allow us to imagine what the future&#8230;could look like as communities continue to communicate with the past while looking to the future.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>A lifelong friendship</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coha and Gunderson have been close friends since the fifth grade. Once it was time for both of them to attend college, Coha chose to attend UC Santa Cruz while Gunderson went to UC San Diego. After two years at separate colleges, Coha convinced Gunderson to transfer to UCSC for his last years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the two friends are philanthropic partners, funding programs and scholarships across divisions at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we started these UCSC projects, it was just a fun way to do stuff together,&#8221; Gunderson said. &#8220;We&#8217;re idealistic creatures, and we always hope we&#8217;re being helpful or contributing. It&#8217;s great to experience it with a friend.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of their other joint philanthropic projects at UCSC include the </span><a href="https://www.monsterstudies.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Monster Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://giving.ucsc.edu/impact-of-giving/gunderson/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gregg Barnes Costume Design Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#160; the </span><a href="https://www.artandoppression.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art and Oppression Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#160;and the J</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/03/rev-spring-15-philanthropy-comics.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ames Gunderson and Peter Coha Comic Book Collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They've also helped to fund the<span>&#160;Digital Scholarship Innovation Studio at the Science and Engineering Library, the Everett Program's Gateways Digital Media Project, and more.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Getting together on a friendship level is great, but also from a philanthropy level, being able to provide seed capacity, seed money, and seed ideas for people to develop further, I think is exciting,&#8221; Coha said. &#8220;And to see those projects flourish is pretty fun.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="30036e288072704622cfa2c63462402e"><name>halloween-message</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Halloween and Halloween Weekend</title><summary>With Halloween weekend, approaching, campus leaders share a message encouraging safety and inclusivity. </summary><start-date>1666940400000</start-date><display-name>Halloween and Halloween Weekend</display-name><path>/2022/10/halloween-message</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/10/halloween-message</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1667252841993</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1667252841993</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear Slugs, <br/><br/>Halloween is just around the corner and we know many of you will celebrate on campus and in the community. We encourage everyone to have a plan to stay safe for Halloween and to look after one another. Here are a few tips to help our entire community celebrate in a safe and inclusive manner: <br/><br/><u><strong>Choose your costume thoughtfully</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remember cultural, ethnic, and religious identities are not costumes.&#160;</strong>For many, wearing a costume is part of the fun of Halloween. However, choosing a costume that demeans or stereotypes others can cause real harm within our community. When choosing a costume, remember our UC&#160; Principles of Community. This <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rbiVikNwNEISNQXcRP-BzncZfegQje-Y/view">Halloween Costume Checklist</a></strong> can help you determine if your costume may be offensive.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Make smart, safe decisions</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid high-risk behaviors involving alcohol and respect peers&#8217; decisions not to drink.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be aware of your surroundings.</strong> Stay alert. Be aware of who is around you. If you choose to drink, know what you are drinking and maintain possession of your drink at all times.</li>
<li><strong>Use the buddy system.&#160;&#160;</strong>Wherever you go, go with a friend or group. Stay together the entire time. Do not separate&#8211;or let others separate&#8211;from your group.&#160;</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful of our campus and our community.&#160;&#160;</strong>If you are hosting a gathering off campus, be aware of local ordinances and laws and follow them accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<u><strong>Respond to emergencies and other Issues&#160;</strong></u>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>CALL 911:&#160;&#160;</strong>Timely calls to 911 save lives. Do not hesitate to report any suspicious activity or behavior by dialing 911 (on campus you may also dial (831) 459-2231, ext 1). If you feel that someone is suffering from substance poisoning or another medical emergency, dial 911 immediately.&#160;</li>
<li><strong>Contact university and college staff:&#160;&#160;</strong>Staff across the University and Colleges (including on-call residential staff and Community Safety Officers (CSOs)) are here to provide support and help.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Know about UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/responsible-action.html">Responsible Action Plan</a>. </strong>Student health and safety are of primary concern at UCSC. As such, in cases of significant intoxication as a result of alcohol or other substances, the University encourages individuals to seek medical assistance for themselves or others. If medical assistance is sought, a conduct record for violations of the University&#8217;s Alcohol and Drugs policies will not be created for the intoxicated student or the student(s) actively seeking medical assistance so long as certain conditions are met. <strong><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/responsible-action.html">Read more about those conditions and the RAP</a></strong> on the Dean of Students website.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Know what&#8217;s happening on campus and in the community</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>On campus:&#160;</strong>A variety of activities have been planned on campus, and we encourage you to check them out! College Instagram accounts feature local events, and the graphic below&#160;has information about some College Sponsored Programs. Also, <strong><a href="https://shop.ucsc.edu/students-in-recovery/thecove.html">The Cove</a></strong> is a substance-free safe space on campus with in-person and online opportunities to connect.&#160;</li>
<li><strong>In the community:&#160;</strong>The City of Santa Cruz is promoting <strong><a href="https://www.santacruz.org/blog/get-spooked-with-these-halloween-events-in-santa-cruz-county/">family friendly activities for Halloween</a></strong>, including <strong><a href="https://www.santacruz.org/upcoming-event/13-days-of-halloween-on-the-wharf-2/">13 Days of Halloween on the Wharf</a></strong>,&#160; <strong><a href="https://www.santacruz.org/upcoming-event/halloween-at-the-boardwalk-3/">Halloween at the Boardwalk</a></strong> on Sunday, October 30 from 12 - 7 p.m. and trick-or-treating on the Santa Cruz Wharf from 3 - 6 p.m. on Monday, October 31.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><u><span><strong>Be aware of increased safety protocols in downtown Santa Cruz</strong></span></u></p>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li><span>Because Santa Cruz officials anticipate Halloween celebrations will draw large crowds to the city, a citywide Safety Enhancement Zone will be in effect from 8 a.m. on October 28 until 8 a.m. November 1. During this time, fees will be tripled for any violations of the city&#8217;s municipal codes, such as littering, blocking pedestrian or vehicular traffic, and public alcohol consumption.&#160;</span></li>
