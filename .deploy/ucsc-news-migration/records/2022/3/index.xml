<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For 2022, we&#8217;ll read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcendent Kingdom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the acclaimed novel from Brooklyn-based author Yaa Gyasi. The book follows Gifty, a daughter of Ghanaian immigrants and a Neuroscience PhD student at Stanford, as she navigates the complexities of being a first-generation scientist of color. Using the methodology of a scientist, Gifty seeks to understand the roots of the drug addiction that killed her brother and her mother&#8217;s depression even as she wrestles with how her religious upbringing can coexist with her secular scientific training.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with Gyasi&#8217;s debut novel </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homegoing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the book reaches beyond the world of these characters to touch on larger issues like the often difficult assimilation of immigrants into American life, the expectations placed on first-generation students as they enter higher education, opioid addiction, and mental health.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 Deep Read series officially gets underway in mid-April, with a host of online and in-person discussions of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcendent Kingdom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That will include regular weekly emails that will unpack different aspects of the book with the guidance of UC Santa Cruz professors, online forums to ask questions and connect with fellow Deep Readers, and a salon where participating professors will lead a discussion with UCSC students and other members of the Deep Read community joining either virtually or in person.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this culminates in an event on May 15, 2022 at the Quarry Amphitheater at UC Santa Cruz where Deep Readers will be able to experience a live discussion on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcendent Kingdom </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the book&#8217;s author Yaa Gyasi.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now in its third year, The Deep Read continues to grow in enthusiasm and participation among the UC Santa Cruz community and beyond,&#8221; said Irena Poli&#263;, the managing director of The Humanities Institute who co-founded The Deep Read with professor of literature Sean Keilen. &#8220;We are especially excited to finally meet many of our Deep Readers in person.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, a special event is planned for Alumni Week on April 20, which includes a discussion with the Deep Read team about the practice of reading deeply and the themes of Gyasi&#8217;s book, as well as in-person and virtual conversations with fellow alumni, Provosts, and current students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a real desire for access to and engagement with the kind of deep thinking and analysis that our scholars in Humanities and across campus provide&#8212;and what makes the Deep Read so special is that it builds community inclusively by opening up this experience to a broad public and by centering issues that are important to all of us,&#8221; said Jasmine Alinder, UCSC&#8217;s Dean of Humanities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For UC Santa Cruz students, the conversation doesn&#8217;t end there. In Spring Quarter 2022, Porter College will be hosting a class titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yaa Gyasi and Contemporary African Diasporic Literature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Led by lecturer Laura Martin, students will use Gyasi&#8217;s books as a springboard into broader discussions surrounding the recent outpouring of important work being done by writers with roots in Africa.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Deep Read Class has been an inspiring way to connect undergraduate students with the broader community at UCSC and beyond,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;This year, students will study Gyasi as a Ghanaian American writer whose work is at the intersection of African American and African Diasporic literary traditions and engages with important and vital themes, such as trauma, the historical legacies of Atlantic slavery, urban mobility, and the difficulty African immigrants face navigating middle-class aspirations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help get Deep Readers started, The Humanities Institute will have 1,200 free copies of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcendent Kingdom </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">available &#8212; 1,000 for UCSC students and 200 for other community members. <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/deepread/">Click here</a> to sign up for updates about the 2022 Deep Read program and to receive information on how you can reserve your free book.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t until she transferred to UC Santa Cruz in 2019 as an Information and Technology Management major that Delgado began to find her community of women, within a male dominated field. Delgado joined organizations like </span><a href="https://gwc.soe.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Girls Who Code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://sweslugs.soe.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Society of Women Engineers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and highlights the importance of finding that community for current students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I felt very alone when I started out as a C.S. major because I was also a transfer student,&#8221; Delgado says. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t really have my study group or people that understood what I was going through, but after I joined Girls Who Code and Society of Women Engineers, I found my community on campus.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delgado emphasizes that about one-quarter of computing-related jobs are held by women. She says that one of her goals is to increase the visibility of STEM role models for women.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having a solid circle of women really improves the quality of your work and life,&#8221; Delglado says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While living in Santa Cruz and attending UCSC, Delgado frequently commuted to modeling shoots in San Francisco. She says her skills in time management, her multipotentialite personality, and having her community on campus allowed her to keep up with her classes and pursue multiple passions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delgado has modeled for international brands like H&amp;M, Lululemon, Adidas, American Eagle, NorthFace, Target, Macy&#8217;s, and more. She has also walked two seasons of New York Fashion Week and can be seen on the pages of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventeen Magazine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosmopolitan U.S.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marie Claire Magazine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently, Delgado was crowned </span><a href="https://www.missearthunitedstates.com/newyork"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miss Earth New York 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and represented New York in the Miss Earth USA Pageant held in Jan. 2022 and placed in the top 20. A self described STEMinist and avid environmentalist, Delgado used her platform on the Miss Earth USA stage to advocate for the representation of women in STEM, and promote plant-based diets.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with her duties as the reigning crown holder of Miss Earth New York 2021, and occasional modeling shoots, Delgado works as a full-time data scientist at Etsy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have very different interests in life, and I feel like other women should feel free to pursue all of their passions,&#8221; Delgado says. &#8220;I feel like this is the era of multipotentialite women. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been motivated to pursue the things I like to do all at once.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>From the Bay Area to the Big Apple&#160;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delgado entered her first beauty pageant immediately after graduating from high school in San Jose. She entered Miss Pacific Coast Teen USA 2017, emphasizing that pageants are huge in Filipino culture, but little did she know how her decision would set the course for the next five years of her life, and elevate her career path.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delgado was crowned Miss Pacific Coast Teen USA 2017 at 18 years old and was immediately scouted by a modeling agency in New York City. She signed with the agency and moved to NYC in June 2017, all while completing computer science courses online through Mission College.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t until she was accepted as a UCSC transfer in 2019 that Delgado returned to the Bay Area. She was only able to attend the university in-person for five months before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the campus in March 2020. Delgado moved back home with her family in San Jose, completed her UCSC classes online, and interned at two startup tech companies as a data science intern.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating in 2021, Delgado returned to New York and began working with Etsy&#8217;s Product Analytics &amp; Strategic Finance team. She and her team help support a platform of over 500,000 small businesses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I never would have expected to be a fashion model and Data Scientist living in NYC,&#8221; she says. &#8220;This is why I encourage young ladies to compete in pageants, some of my best friends I&#8217;ve met through pageantry, I&#8217;ve gained so much confidence, and it has truly been a stepping stone in my career!&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delgado says one of her biggest goals in life is to represent New York on the Miss USA stage and ultimately represent the U.S. in Miss Universe. She is already registered to compete in the preliminary pageant, Miss New York USA, in June 2022.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="47fc917d8072704664be42b49343a7c6"><name>ukraine-statement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Russian invasion of Ukraine - Supporting our community</title><summary>Over the past week, we have closely followed the news of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and we join the international community in condemning this unprovoked attack. </summary><start-date>1646121600000</start-date><display-name>Supporting our community </display-name><path>/2022/03/ukraine-statement</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/ukraine-statement</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1646180208978</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1646180208978</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear UC Santa Cruz Community,&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that members of our community have personal and professional connections with Ukraine, Ukrainians, and many others who are now unexpectedly in peril.&#160; Images and news accounts of the fighting and destruction are terrifying and heartbreaking, difficult to encounter and process.&#160; If you or someone you know needs support, we encourage you to take advantage of the free campus resources available.&#160;</span></p>

<p>As the transmission rate of COVID-19 continues to fall, the default mode of instruction for most courses will be in-person, with room capacities at 100%. We are eager for students and instructors to once again be in classrooms together, and we are encouraged by the fact that the campus had no documented cases of in-class transmission of COVID-19 at any point in the pandemic, thanks to the mitigation measures introduced at each stage to respond to the pandemic and its many variants.</p>
<p>As we did prior to the pandemic, the campus will also offer some intentionally designed online offerings. These courses have been approved by the Academic Senate to be offered in an online format. Some of these courses are synchronous and others asynchronous.</p>
<p>The schedule of fall classes will be released in May and will contain detailed information about each course&#8217;s modality. Except in very rare cases, remote attendance in in-person courses for the entire quarter will not be available in 2022-23.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to anticipate what public health measures, if any, will be required in the fall. Whatever the future brings, our priority will continue to be the wellbeing of our students, faculty, and staff. We will rely on the guidance of our county, state and federal health leaders, and when needed, enforce mitigation measures to support the well being of our campus community and operational needs.</p>
<p>We would like to thank you for your understanding and flexibility over the past two years as we have continued to advance our campus mission while prioritizing the well-being of our Banana Slug community. You have consistently demonstrated a collective commitment to taking appropriate measures to minimize the impacts of COVID-19. We know these efforts have not been easy. Because of all our collective efforts, we believe we are ready to return to predominantly in-person teaching, learning, research and creative scholarship and service this fall, while retaining some online course offerings for those students who want to take advantage of them.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4cd354fe8072704664be42b4d55ab0b4"><name>danielle-dadiego</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Danielle Dadiego named recipient of 2022 Society for American Archaeology Dissertation Award</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz alumna Danielle Dadiego (M.A. Anthropology, ’17; Ph.D. Anthropology, ’20) has worked in the archeology field for nearly two decades.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using all of the tools at her disposal via&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC's Anthropology Department and Plasma Analytical lab</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;cutting-edge technology, mentorship from faculty, grants, and fellowships&#8212;Dadiego was able to explore every avenue in her dissertation research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Above all, I&#8217;m honored,&#8221; Dadiego says. &#8220;It shows that we (UCSC) have a very rigorous program, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">one that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenges students to produce quality work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judith </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Habicht-Mauche</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, professor emeritus and close mentor of Dadiego&#8217;s, says Dadiego&#8217;s win emphasizes the caliber of UCSC&#8217;s archeological program. She says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this honor is usually given to recent Ph.D.s from larger, older, and more established graduate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">programs around the nation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For someone from our small and relatively new program to win this award is truly amazing,&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Habicht-Mauche</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says. &#8220;It shows that our graduates can compete nationally with the very best in our discipline." </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her dissertation, </span><a href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt8qm5q59w/qt8qm5q59w.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beads, Bullets, and Brokerage: Exploring Economic Agency in Eighteenth-Century West Florida</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dadiego combined three different methods in historical archaeology to provide evidence of how goods moved through colonial and indigenous communities in 18th century West Florida.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadiego used archival research, traditional artifact analysis, chemical composition, and isotopic analysis to examine a collection of sites in Pensacola, Florida, from the 18th century. She focused on illicit trade between and among Native American groups living in colonial Pensacola and between Spanish, British, and French colonists.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining these multiple research approaches and techniques greatly enhanced the richness and multifaceted nature of her historical and anthropological interpretations and made for a highly original and truly outstanding dissertation,&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Habicht-Mauche </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her time at UC Santa Cruz, Dadiego was awarded several grants to pursue her research, including ARC Graduate Research Grants, Anthropology Department Summer/Winter Travel Grants, Graduate Research Assistantships, and the Graduate Student Association GRAF Research Grant. She was also awarded the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dissertation Improvement Grant from the National Science Foundation in 2019.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds she received from those grants helped pay for her trips to Haiti, where she worked on the UNESCO World Heritage Site. They also allowed her to use groundbreaking equipment like Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">LA-ICP-MS )</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; a resource available to students on campus but expensive to put into use. At UCSC, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadiego developed protocols for using LA-ICP-MS to chemically characterize and source majolica pottery and glass trade beads from several colonial mission and presidio contexts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It would have been impossible without that kind of support,&#8221; Dadiego says. &#8220;My ambitions of what I wanted to get done were high, and archaeometry itself is very expensive, and so having that avenue and support from the faculty to get these grants made it possible to make my dissertation cutting edge.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Dadiego&#8217;s archaeological pursuits</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadiego has been in the archaeology field for nearly two decades, has traveled around the world, including Canada, Spain, and Haiti, and received her degrees from universities around the country.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She received her B.A. in Geography-Anthropology with a concentration in Anthropology at the University of Southern Maine in 2007. Her first field school trip was to Canada, where she got to work with the indigenous Cree population on their reservation. She says the collaborative work she got to do there hooked her into archaeology right off the bat.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Archaeology is rigorous physically, but you&#8217;re also experiencing tangible history, and you&#8217;re sharing it with other people,&#8221; Dadiego says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She worked in cultural resource management before pursuing her Master&#8217;s in Anthropology at the University of West Florida in 2014. During her time at UWF, she traveled to Spain multiple times, where she experienced working in archives and began focusing her work on Spanish colonial archaeology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadiego said when it was time to pursue her Ph.D., UC Santa Cruz was her first choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being at UCSC and having the labs, the expertise of the faculty, and working with Judith on laser ablation, is something that&#8217;s not available or accessible at most universities,&#8221; Dadiego says. &#8220;The program at UC Santa Cruz allowed me, as a professional, to create a niche that&#8217;s not widely filled. I&#8217;m extremely grateful for the experience that I had at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4d3ad4938072704664be42b421c9e35e"><name>spring-break-covid-protocol</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Spring break COVID testing protocol and travel guidelines</title><summary>With the end of winter quarter quickly approaching, we write to share UCSC’s 2022 COVID spring break guidelines.</summary><start-date>1646208000000</start-date><display-name>Spring break COVID testing protocol and travel guidelines</display-name><path>/2022/03/spring-break-covid-protocol</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/spring-break-covid-protocol</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1646268175429</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662581884096</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>With the end of winter quarter quickly approaching, we write to share UCSC&#8217;s 2022 COVID spring break guidelines.&#160;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before you leave campus: Test on campus before you travel</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Traveling for spring break? Whether you are venturing near or far this break, it is important to test before and after you travel. </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html%23Testing&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646354148110000&amp;usg=AOvVaw32xSRJ9BMi3WK6v2L5S8sM" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html#Testing" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Testing on campus</span></a><span> before you travel can help protect your own health as well as the health of those you will be around during the break.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before you return to campus: Test 24 hours before your return</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It is equally important to test before you return to campus. As such, all students are expected to complete an at-home test 24 hours before returning to campus. Rapid antigen test kits will be available to pick up, one kit per student, from College Housing offices, Bay Tree Bookstore, Barn Theater, and Scotts Valley Center beginning March 7.&#160;</span></p>

<h2>Spring Break Return Testing Protocol</h2>
<p>We realize that most of you plan to work through Spring Break as usual. However, if you plan to travel, we&#8217;d strongly encourage you to make testing part of your spring break plans. Staff and faculty are not required to test, but testing before you leave on travel and after you return to campus protects your own health, as well as our campus community. Regardless of your vaccination status, <strong>we strongly encourage you to take a COVID-19 test 24 hours before returning to on-site work.</strong>Please see our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html%23springbreakreturn&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646412921325000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-kE6CmUdVkL_eRNqvbJ5C" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html#springbreakreturn" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spring Break Return Testing Protocol</a> for additional information.</p>
<h2>Free Test Kits Available</h2>
<p>If you plan to travel over spring break, free COVID-19 testing kits are available for pick-up at the Scotts Valley Center, Barn Theater, and Bay Tree Campus Store between <em>10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday</em>beginning on March 7. <strong>Please note that we can only provide one kit per individual, and it is intended for use before you return to campus.</strong></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Machine learning models, artificial intelligence algorithms that improve themselves through data and experience, are being applied in a variety of industries that have serious impacts on peoples&#8217; lives such as the screening of loan applications in financial services or Medicare applications in healthcare.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Liu&#8217;s research project will address issues of robustness, fairness, and the dynamics that arise in this field from a data-centric perspective. His team will study how algorithms can become biased by replicating existing biases in the data sets that train the models, but more importantly, they will build models to understand and predict humans&#8217; behaviors when interacting with machine learning algorithms and consider the data produced by that interaction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Part of the proposed research will focus on understanding the possibilities of identifying and mitigating the natural bias and noise that exists in data from humans,&#8221; Liu said. &#8220;But looking one step further, it&#8217;s not just about machine learning and how it performs on the data you already have, it&#8217;s about the data that it&#8217;s going to generate in the future &#8211; I think that&#8217;s the missing part in most of the ongoing discussions. I care about the data that is going to be generated after a machine learning model and a data collection pipeline is deployed, so that&#8217;s one of the main inquiries of this proposal.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Liu and his team will also use NSF funding to carry out human-subject studies to understand how people respond to various machine learning models in a wide range of applications, from financial services to recommendation systems, and possibly school admissions. They will use these experiments to build theoretical frameworks and computational solutions to ensure that machine learning models are designed and deployed to serve humans without bias.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Machine learning is not going to be a one-shot or a static problem anymore,&#8221; Liu said. &#8220;Model accuracy matters, but it will become mores about long-term well-being. What are the behaviors, what are the dynamics that the model is going to induce on people? That&#8217;s something I am going to really focus on.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additionally, Liu wants to make sure that machine-learning models provide people with opportunities for improvement.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some machine learning models give results without offering any explanation, and even when they do offer explanations, they often lack constructive suggestions for the user. For example, a constructive suggestion in the context of financial services might look like offering a way in which a customer who currently does not qualify for a loan could improve upon their financial profile to be approved in the future. Liu hopes that building out this level of transparency could increase human trust in machine learning technology, allowing it to become more widely adopted.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookins was raised in Sacramento and currently resides in Maryland, where she is the Human Resources and Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion Coordinator for the University of Maryland&#8217;s School of Information Studies. She says that being a Black and Queer womxn at UC Santa Cruz pushed her to go above and beyond in all that she accomplished.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I enjoyed living and working with my community at UCSC; they were really the folks who grounded me when I felt my life was thrown off balance,&#8221; Brookins says. &#8220;Fostering a community was one thing at UCSC, but finding myself was another.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her time at UCSC, Brookins interned at the African American Resource &amp; Cultural Center (AARCC) and served as the Residential Advisor for the Rosa Parks African American Themed House (RPAATH).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookins wanted to experience every possible opportunity UCSC had to offer. She promised herself that she would say yes to leadership opportunities that came her way.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was in this approach that I learned to feel the fear and do it anyway,&#8221; Brookins says. &#8220;Regardless of what I was afraid of, I made sure to encourage myself.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to her roles at the AARC and RPAATH, Brookins also worked with the Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS), The Diversity Facilitators Team (DFT), and The Student Success Advisory Council. Through her time with CAPS, Brookins says she learned to break down the stigma around mental health. DFT gave her the chance to co-facilitate training sessions for students and staff, and with The Student Success Advisory Council, she voiced students&#8217; needs for obtaining success.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Creating equity and belonging in spaces I was part of became a true passion of mine to ensure that everyone has a seat at the table, and if they didn&#8217;t&#8212;I&#8217;d bring one,&#8221; Brookins says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among all her experiences at UCSC, Brookins says the most memorable and transformative was participating in the UCDC (Washington, DC) program in her final term of undergraduate studies. After graduating, she moved back to DC without securing a job.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Taking that leap of faith, trusting myself, and my vision was the greatest decision I made,&#8221; Brookins says. &#8220;Feeling the fear of the unknown but doing it anyway is how I achieved all I have to this day. The opportunities that UCSC offered encouraged me to choose my own adventure, and in that, I have grown to be fearless.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Galdamez knew that with hard work and determination, he would fulfill his dreams of higher education and, one day, be able to encourage students in similar situations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galdamez was born in a rural, impoverished town in El Salvador. When he was about two years old, his mother left him with his grandmother to immigrate to the U.S., seeking a better life and escaping the crude reality of warfare. While in El Salvador, Galdamez&#8217;s mother sold oranges and other fruits on local transportation buses, earning 5 colones (an equivalent of $0.70) per day. When he was 9 years old, Galdamez came to the U.S. with a permanent residence card with the assistance of a middle-income family for whom his mother had worked.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz truly changed my life,&#8221; Galdamez says. &#8220;It opened my eyes to a world of possibilities, and I encountered amazing support to overcome any challenges that I would face, including embracing my alignment within the LGBT+ community.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galdamez graduated from Merrill College in 2006 with a degree in Political Science and Latin American &amp; Latino Studies. While at UCSC, Galdamez worked as a Paraprofessional Undergraduate Providing Learning Services to Migrant Students (P.U.P.I.L.S) in Watsonville for three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galdamez later obtained a Master&#8217;s in Public Administration from Cal State Los Angeles. He worked as the Chief Operating Officer for a nonprofit organization based out of Los Angeles for many years, assisting individuals with disabilities and maximizing their quality of life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Galdamez works as an Immigration Services Officer for the Department of Homeland Security and serves on the UCSC Alumni Council, a group of dedicated volunteer leaders who support the mission of UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I firmly believe that determination, hard work, and perseverance, along with having individuals around you who are committed to your success, makes a world of a difference,&#8221; Galdamez says.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5695216c8072704664be42b475903122"><name>angelo-ias-member</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Institute For Advanced Study selects environmental sociologist Hillary Angelo as a member </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Sociology Hillary Angelo was selected among a group of 25 world-leading  researchers and academics who will focus on the theme “Climate Crisis Politics" as 2022-2023 members of the IAS School of Social Science.&#13;

The Institute&#8217;s 2022-2023 members in the <a href="https://www.ias.edu/sss">School of Social Science</a> will focus on the theme &#8220;Climate Crisis Politics,&#8221; and Angelo will contribute her expertise as an urban and environmental sociologist.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m really excited to be a part of this, and it&#8217;s especially wonderful to see the IAS School of Social Science focusing on climate change,&#8221; Angelo said. &#8220;It acknowledges the existential importance of this issue for our future, and it&#8217;s cultivating good interdisciplinary scholarship, which is exactly the kind of thinking that climate change requires.&#8221;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angelo&#8217;s membership in the IAS will include joining a residential community at the Institute&#8217;s campus in Princeton, New Jersey, from fall 2022 through spring 2023, during which time she&#8217;ll collaborate with other scholars in the cohort and focus on her individual research. She&#8217;s currently working on a book that explores how the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy can either transform or reproduce existing land use policies, perceptions of nature, and political and economic relationships.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Angelo will study these issues on public lands in the United States, with examples from areas like Bears Ears National Monument, on the border of Utah and Arizona, and deserts in California and Nevada.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In southern Utah and northern Arizona, we see the decline of fossil fuels and hydropower, and there&#8217;s been a big involvement of Indigenous groups, huge recreational interest, and coordinated efforts among natural scientists, archaeologists, and tribes to preserve these landscapes and treat them in new ways,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been contrasting that to the buildout of renewable energy in the Nevada and California desert, where some of these new resources are being developed within the same old patterns as fossil fuels.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angelo&#8217;s member position with the IAS will allow her to focus on writing for the new book, and she also plans to conduct additional archival research. She says she&#8217;s grateful for the opportunity to focus on the project and is looking forward to collaborating with IAS members.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It's an amazing group of people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It's always exciting to have time to do research and writing, but it&#8217;s even better to have time with people who can help me think through new ideas.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="56af87288072704664be42b47320ecc1"><name>feedback-vc-it-recruitment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Feedback welcome for Vice Chancellor for Information Technology recruitment</title><summary>We have created a survey for each finalist for you to provide feedback to me and the search advisory committee.

The spring-like weather of the past week surely hasn&#8217;t hurt, but there&#8217;s also so much happening right now.</p>
<p>I was able to catch our women's basketball team at the Kaiser Permanente Arena on Saturday. Thank you to all you Slug supporters who turned out. The women lost a Coast-To-Coast Tournament finals heart-breaker, but that doesn&#8217;t diminish the fantastic season these incredible scholar-athletes put together. They finished the regular season 16-4, a school-record for winning percentage. Congratulations!</p>
<p>Sunday I was thrilled to see <em>&#8217;da Kink in My Hair,</em> put on by our African American Theater Arts Troupe on the Mainstage at our Theater Arts Center. The play was incredibly moving and thought-provoking. Congratulations to the entire troupe, from the actors to those working behind the scenes. It was an extremely well-done production. Thank you!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re smack dab in the busiest stretch of winter quarter right now, but take a breather when you can. Mental breaks are not only recommended but necessary!</p>

<h2>Campus mask-wearing protocols remain place</h2>
<p>California earlier this week changed its mask guidance. The requirement that unvaccinated individuals mask in indoor public settings is now a strong recommendation that all persons, regardless of vaccine status, continue indoor masking. Masks will no longer be required in K-12 schools as of March 11, leaving it up to counties and school districts to decide whether to keep or rescind face-covering requirements. It feels great to be moving in this direction; however, please note that campus protocols have yet to change. We are currently reviewing our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646510395759000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3sCOxIh-uWZfImCgjqZ8cZ" href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mask guidelines</a> and expect to communicate expectations for spring quarter.</p>
<h2>Resources available to those struggling with world events</h2>
<p>I know that many people in our community have personal and professional connections with Ukraine, Ukrainians, and others now in peril. As Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer and I wrote in a <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/ukraine-statement.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646510395759000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3PtrNnoL7CEyiVipjGMoyJ" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/ukraine-statement.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message published in this week&#8217;s Tuesday Newsday</a>, if you or someone you know needs support, please take advantage of the free campus resources available that are detailed in the message. These are difficult times, and it&#8217;s important that we support each other.</p>
<h2>Professor Ramirez-Ruiz honored by White House</h2>
<p>I was thrilled to learn earlier this month that Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, was <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/02/presidential-award.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646510395759000&amp;usg=AOvVaw12WKAzFM57W5_fOLV5IZpP" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/02/presidential-award.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">honored by the White House</a> with a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring. Mentors play a crucial role in developing a science and engineering workforce that reflects the immense talent that exists in all corners of our state, nation and world, and Enrico&#8217;s work in this arena is second to none.</p>
<p>Enrico has promoted STEM training research programs during his entire 14 years at UCSC, and has mentored hundreds of students, postdocs, and junior faculty. His NSF-funded Lamat mentorship program has been remarkably successful at increasing the number of historically marginalized students who earn doctorates in astrophysics, with a dozen earning prestigious NASA postdoctoral fellowships. Incredibly, Enrico and the Lamat program have together trained half of all historically marginalized students receiving astronomy Ph.D.s in the United States in the past five years. He is extremely deserving of this honor. Congratulations, Enrico!</p>
<h2>Search underway for first VC for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h2>
<p>I am pleased to pass along that we have kicked off a national search for our first-ever Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We hope to complete the search in time to have the new leader on campus in the fall. Fostering an inclusive campus climate that embraces and values diversity and equity is a campus priority, and I look forward to campus input on the appointment. The finalists will visit us toward the end of spring quarter, with each giving a town-hall talk open to members of our campus community. More information on the search and how to offer feedback can be found on our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/recruitment/vc-diversity-equity-inclusion.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646510395759000&amp;usg=AOvVaw37b_gxBgR2SEgjUUK32u-7" href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/recruitment/vc-diversity-equity-inclusion.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion recruitment webpage</a>.</p>
<h2>Our most successful holiday food drive yet</h2>
<p>I offer my deep gratitude to all who took part in the recent Second Harvest Holiday Food &amp; Fund Drive. Each year the campus collects food and financial contributions for the drive, and this year we <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/02/second-harvest-food-drive-record-dw.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646510395759000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3wxzKic_9umXqgJiTCfu-A" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/02/second-harvest-food-drive-record-dw.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">surpassed all of our previous totals</a>. We raised the equivalent of 376,099 meals! That earned us the President&#8217;s Cup award, given each year to the public institution that raises the most meals during the annual food drive! As co-chair of the larger Second Harvest Drive, this campus effort makes me especially proud. UC Santa Cruz fosters such a strong culture of giving. There&#8217;s a deep sense of responsibility and community. I am grateful to everyone who helped make this year&#8217;s drive such a success. These are hard times economically for so many, and your contributions make a tangible, significant difference.</p>
<h2>Celebrating Women&#8217;s History Month</h2>
<p>Women&#8217;s History Month, observed every March, encourages the study, observance and celebration of the vital role of women in U.S. history. I appreciate the opportunity to honor the excellence of our colleagues, students, alumni, and friends.

Our gender diversity at the chancellor, campus provost, and dean levels stands out among our peers. Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Kletzer and I are committed to diversifying leadership at all levels campuswide, as we believe strongly that with diversity comes excellence.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year&#8217;s online version was a surprise hit, with thousands of Slugs and their loved ones taking part in the festivities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we wanted to build upon the reach we achieved when we went fully virtual in 2021,&#8221; said Diana Hogue, university events coordinator at UCSC. &#8220;But we also want to weave in the traditional in-person experience that so many of our alumni have come to love, and so we decided to move forward with a hybrid version.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s event will start with screens and end with analog experiences.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday night, Alumni Week shifts gears into the in-person realm with a major </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/strange_weather_alumni_reception_at_the_mah#.YhlMzi1h35Z"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kickoff event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Museum of Art and History in downtown Santa Cruz.

When it opened in 1965, much of the campus was still unbuilt, students were living in trailers, classes were being held in a sprawling field house, and the fledgling university was still making a name for itself.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, pioneer Slugs must be asking themselves, &#8220;Where did the time go?&#8221; This year, there will be an unusual assortment of 50th anniversary celebrations during the annual </span><a href="https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The milestone reunions have packed event lineups throughout the week, offering alumni a unique experience that will warm their hearts,&#8221; said Shayna Kent, executive director of alumni engagement at UCSC.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown College will fill its </span><a href="https://crown50reunion.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50th reunion celebration</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with activities celebrating the college&#8217;s spirit.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crownies&#8217; 50th reunion will include folk dancing around the fountain at Crown, bringing back a Friday ritual from when they were students,&#8221; Kent said.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There will also be activities for Crownies from all years, including a </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/crown_annual_all_alumni_dinner#.YiKKJxPMLOQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown All-Alumni Dinner </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on Saturday and a </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/crown_brunch_with_the_provost#.YiKKohPMLOQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provost Brunch </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on Sunday.&#160;</span><br/>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The college will also hold a special </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/cowell_colloquium_1968_to_the_present_beyond_nostalgia_hybrid_on-campus_and_live-streamed_event#.YhlQlS1h35Y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-person and online Saturday morning colloquium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that examines why people hold reunions in the first place. The presentation is called &#8220;1968 to the present: Beyond nostalgia.&#8221;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Natural History Field Quarter will present </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/incorporating_natural_history_into_your_post-college_career_and_life#.YiKLKBPMLOR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a small panel of alumni </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">working in various natural history-related fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event will cover a range of topics, including early-career advice, encouraging greater diversity, inclusion in various natural history-related disciplines, and more. It will also include an invitation for anyone hoping to come to the Natural History Field Quarter&#8217;s 50-year celebration event on June 3-5.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other reunions and celebrations will take place across the campus or in the virtual realm.

There will be a reunion for Focus on Africa alumni who took the program from the years 2014 through 2021, as well as public recognition of the newly formed co-op partnership with University of Nairobi.</span></p>

The spray-painted images and words are horrific and have historically been used to inspire terror and to degrade and dehumanize Black and Jewish people. These symbols have taken on broader white supremacist meanings in the 21st century and have also been used against many communities of color. We resolutely condemn this crime.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Understanding the clinical significance of rare genetic variants requires analyzing large amounts of genomic and clinical data. Privacy policies, however, restrict the sharing of this information between institutions, and no single institution is likely to have all the resources needed for a robust analysis.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(22)00029-5"><span class="s2">paper published March 9</span></a> in the journal <i>Cell Genomics</i>, UCSC researchers showed that an approach called federated analysis can overcome this problem by &#8220;bringing the code to the data.&#8221; This is the first application of federated analysis to enable classification of previously unclassified genetic variants.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We have to find ways to get to the data that respect privacy, but still let researchers do their research, so the federated model is definitely the way of the future,&#8221; said James Casaletto, a PhD candidate at UCSC&#8217;s Baskin School of Engineering and the paper&#8217;s lead author.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The study focused on genetic variants of the breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. People who inherit harmful variants of one of these genes have increased risks of breast, ovarian and other cancers. Many people, however, have variants of unknown significance (VUS) in these genes, meaning scientists don&#8217;t know if these variants are harmful or not.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new study provides a more nuanced understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. It also serves as a &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; of a novel data sharing and analysis technique for assessing the clinical implications of genetic variants.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Specific VUS are individually rare but collectively it is common for VUS in general to occur in the human population. To better understand exactly which VUS are disease-causing, researchers need to perform delicate analysis on a wide set of data, which can then be interpreted by experts to make clinical conclusions.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;This has to do with the everyday person who maybe wonders if there&#8217;s a history of cancer in her family, and if she&#8217;s inherited that family cancer risk,&#8221; said Melissa Cline, a research scientist at the UCSC Genomics Institute and co-author on the paper. &#8220;All of this work is going to the aim of making genetic testing better.&#8221;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, most of the world&#8217;s human health data is &#8216;siloed&#8217;, or stored inaccessibly due to&#160; privacy laws, and institutions may be prohibited from exporting genomic data they collect, making it inaccessible to researchers who study genetic variants.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additionally, engineering the software needed to execute these analyses is complex and usually cannot be undertaken by the average geneticist. UCSC researchers are addressing these two problems with their novel approach of federated analysis.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the federated analysis approach, researchers bring the code to the data, avoiding the need to export sensitive data at all. UCSC Genomics Institute software is sent in a &#8220;container&#8221; to any collaborating institution around the world that is home to a valuable but protected set of genomic data. The collaborating institution then uses the software to analyze their data within their institution&#8217;s secure environment, generating summary data that does not reveal personal information about individual patients.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This approach ensures that patient-level data meets the strict privacy rules of an institution that do not allow them to export data, but allows researchers to collect a much wider pool of genomic data which can lead to better clinical conclusions. Moreover, federated analysis can get around the issues of uploading, downloading and moving around huge data sets that can be prohibitively large.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;[The paper is] a proof of concept that we have this container technology, we&#8217;ve leveraged it for BRCA1 and BRCA2, we&#8217;ve also demonstrated in the research that it can be used for other genes &#8211; genotypes and phenotypes,&#8221; Casaletto said.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For this project, UCSC researchers collaborated with the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences in Japan to analyze their biobank of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genomic data. These genes are inherited from a person&#8217;s parents and when mutated can lead to an increased risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They used this to make discoveries about which specific variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes led to cancer and which left patients unaffected, moving the needle on a number of previously uncertain variants.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In undertaking this analysis, the researchers were able to help address the lack of diversity in genetic databases.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The genetics of white people are highly over-represented, the genetics of non-white people are much more of a mystery, due to a lot of historical biases in data collection,&#8221; Cline said. &#8220;We were also able to add together a little more knowledge on Japanese genetics than was previously available.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Further collaboration using federated analysis with institutes worldwide could similarly do much to address the lack of representation of non-white people and empower institutions that may be resource-poor to contribute to the global genomic data pool.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;What's been done in the past is basically a lot less data sharing, so the name of the game is really global data sharing,&#8221; Cline said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The researchers also work with the The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), which helps set policy and create technical standards for responsible, ethical data sharing. They gave guidance on what data sharing can be done legally and responsibly, and helped establish methods to make the Genomics Institute software portable across different operating systems and environments to allow for collaboration like that in this project.</span></p>

For rare or threatened species, understanding which factors cause populations to boom or bust isn&#8217;t just academic; the answers can mean the difference between sound population management and species extinction.</p>
<p>These concerns have loomed large regarding the northern tidewater goby. A spotted fish about the size of a thumb drive, this federally endangered species occurs only in California estuaries, often alongside the far more common three-spined stickleback.</p>
<p>Because the two fish are essentially the same size, and eat the same aquatic invertebrates, scientists have worried that the stickleback is literally eating the goby&#8217;s lunch. One lab study has already shown that when stickleback flourish, goby numbers suffer.</p>
<p>But scientists at UC Santa Cruz suspected the fishes&#8217; habitat might play an equal if not more important role. &#8220;These fish don&#8217;t exist in a vacuum. There&#8217;s strong environmental fluctuations where they live,&#8221; says Ben Wasserman, a former Ph.D. student at UC Santa Cruz and now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Connecticut. &#8220;That challenges the ability of experiments to properly account for all those other factors that could influence their interactions.&#8221;</p>
<h2>An extreme environment</h2>
<p>The only type of habitat the goby occurs in is bar-built estuaries. Separated from the ocean by a sandbar, these estuaries resemble stagnant lagoons for much of the year. But what truly makes these estuaries extreme environments is their propensity to breach. When enough rain has fallen, the water dammed behind the sandbar will shove the barrier aside. What was once a brimming waterway then drains catastrophically into the ocean. This can leave fish and other lagoon residents high and dry for hours to days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever they breach, it&#8217;s a dramatic shift in the water and oxygen and salinity conditions for the resident organisms,&#8221; says Eric Palkovacs, a UCSC professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and Wasserman&#8217;s graduate advisor.</p>
<p>As a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz, Wasserman was determined to study the goby and stickleback in their natural environment. He collected data on goby and stickleback numbers from 2014&#8211;2020 and, with a technique called empirical dynamic modeling, he was able to factor in how estuary conditions affected fish populations. He and his collaborators report in the journal <em>Limnology and Oceanography</em> that the state of estuary waters, not competition from another fish species, is the most important predictor of fish numbers at any given time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope this shows the promise of this technique in a wider variety of applications, like population management and conservation,&#8221; says Wasserman. &#8220;There are many cases when available population monitoring data should allow us to extract more information.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Perfect spot for a study</h2>
<p>Wasserman studied interactions between the two fish at Younger Lagoon Reserve. Located at the western edge of Santa Cruz, it is one of the 41 protected landscapes in the UC Natural Reserve System.</p>
<p>As a textbook example of a bar-built estuary, Younger proved an ideal setting for Wasserman&#8217;s research. The stickleback and the tidewater goby are the lagoon&#8217;s only two fishes. Its small size made it easy to sample comprehensively. Its staff collect a bevy of environmental data, including temperature and rainfall, and even maintains a camera pointed at the lagoon mouth that documents the exact dates of breaches.</p>
<p>Wasserman first needed to track the populations of each fish over time. Once a month over seven years, he and teams of volunteers submerged wire mesh fish traps around the lagoon&#8217;s shore. Roughly the size and shape of a watermelon, the traps had inward-facing funnels on each end.</p>
<p>&#8220;When fish encounter the mesh, they swim along it, and the funnel drops them off in the middle of the thing. Since they have to make a U-turn to get out, they mostly don&#8217;t figure out how to escape,&#8221; Wasserman says.</p>
<p>The researchers also took a snapshot of water conditions on each trip, measuring oxygen, temperature, and salinity readings.</p>
<p>Visiting regularly over seven years, Wasserman developed a feel for the lagoon&#8217;s behavior. &#8220;I knew Younger&#8217;s rhythms, to the point where in a storm one day, I said, it&#8217;s going to breach. And I put on my rain gear and went out and waited. I saw that first trickle across the sand, and then as soon as the soft sand got soaking wet it was like a dam blowing out. And in two hours I watched a channel erode probably ten feet deep and drain the water that had taken all fall to accumulate,&#8221; he says.</p>
<h2>Getting to know your estuary</h2>
<p>To analyze his field data, Wasserman applied new methods developed to forecast complex systems such as stock markets. Biologists first used empirical dynamic models (EDMs) to manage commercial fisheries. EDMs can also factor in other parameters such as water temperature and chemistry as well as the number of days since the estuary breached.</p>
<p>Older modeling methods also require the scientist to guess at the nature of the relationship between factors. For example, goby numbers could drop linearly as stickleback numbers rise, or rise exponentially at some later date, or curve over time as seasonal temperatures change. The algorithms in empirical dynamic models take that guessing off the table. They can define relationships based on raw data. &#8220;When there&#8217;s so many potential influences out in nature on your focal organisms, this helps you follow whatever signal there is in your data, and pulls that to your attention rather than you applying a certain assumption,&#8221; Wasserman says.</p>
<p>Wasserman applied one type of EDM, convergent cross mapping, to determine whether his time series data could predict influences on population. &#8220;We asked, what can predict our focal species, the goby? Is it stickleback abundance, or any of those other things, like temperature or salinity or days since breaching? And then we asked the same question for the stickleback.&#8221;</p>
<p>The one factor that turned out to predict more goby was lots of stickleback.</p>
<p>Wasserman used a second type of EDM, the s-map, to determine whether environmental conditions affect interactions between the two fish. This approach revealed that stickleback numbers only affect goby numbers in spring.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;If the stickleback have a good spring, the gobies are going to have a good summer,&#8221; Wasserman says. He suspects both fishes are responding in the same way to a common environmental driver, such as spring productivity. Here, the additional sunlight from longer days encourages the proliferation of algae, which in turn boosts populations of the aquatic insects both fishes eat.</p>
<h2>Influence of environment</h2>
<p>Similarly, the one factor that affected stickleback numbers was a recent lagoon breach. &#8220;We would go out there during severe breaching events, and the stickleback would be really struggling. All or most are dead or struggling to get enough oxygen,&#8221; Palkovacs says. The gobies were able to survive even when the lagoon had transformed into a mudflat. &#8220;The gobies might be lying on the sand or in the pickleweed after a breach. But if you were to go up and poke them, they would wiggle away and find a pool.&#8221;</p>
<p>The difference in the two fishes&#8217; responses likely stems from their respective ecological niches. Tidewater goby are specialists that have evolved to cope with seasonal breaching. They can tolerate the hypersaline conditions of late fall, extremely low levels of dissolved oxygen, and even the complete drying of the lagoon.</p>
<p>Stickleback, on the other hand, are generalists. They occur in a wide variety of habitats across the Northern Hemisphere, from tidal streams to nearshore coastal waters. In Younger Lagoon, their populations soar when conditions are good, but may crash and sometimes disappear after a breach.</p>
<p>The take-home lesson for wildlife managers? Reducing stickleback numbers are unlikely to help the goby. The most important factor for its survival appears to maintaining the breaching cycle in their estuarine habitats. Unfortunately, many of California&#8217;s bar-built estuaries have disappeared as a result of human activities. Their sandbars are often kept open artificially to form harbors, while upland development, culverts, or bridges can disrupt their filling and breaching cycles.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my previous ecological research, I was looking at the fish or the bird or the bug or the plant. This environment forced me to see the importance of the physical process setting the stage,&#8221; Wasserman says.</p>
<p>For Palkovacs, the study also underscores the value of field research. &#8220;These fish have all the characteristics that might lead you to assume they&#8217;re competing, and even lab experiments show that. Our point is that you you can&#8217;t necessarily go from lab experiments to understanding what&#8217;s happening in the wild. We need to know from actual ecosystems what&#8217;s happening.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="70e67d488072704664be42b421aea272"><name>rsv-protein-vaccine</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New study confirms bioengineered RSV protein vaccine evokes protective immune response</title><summary>Two UC Santa Cruz researchers just marked a major milestone in their effort to create an effective vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can cause severe respiratory disease in children and the elderly.</summary><start-date>1646928000000</start-date><path>/2022/03/rsv-protein-vaccine</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/rsv-protein-vaccine</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1646866627891</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1647039770524</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/images/dubois-lab-4001.png</path><link>site://news/2022/03/images/dubois-lab-4001.png</link><site>news</site><name>dubois-lab-4001.png</name><display-name>dubois-lab-400.png</display-name><file-size>198972</file-size><width>400</width><height>266</height></image><image-alt>Rebecca DuBois and Ana Nuñez Castrejon stand in front of a whiteboard.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/images/dubois-lab-801.png</path><link>site://news/2022/03/images/dubois-lab-801.png</link><site>news</site><name>dubois-lab-801.png</name><display-name>dubois-lab-80.png</display-name><file-size>17742</file-size><width>80</width><height>71</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Rebecca DuBois and Ana Nuñez Castrejon stand in front of a whiteboard.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Co-author Rebecca DuBois and lead author Ana Nu&#241;ez Castrejon (behind).</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/images/engineered_rsvg_arrow_350.png</path><link>site://news/2022/03/images/engineered_rsvg_arrow_350.png</link><site>news</site><name>engineered_rsvg_arrow_350.png</name><display-name>engineered_rsvg_arrow_350.png</display-name><file-size>127817</file-size><width>350</width><height>395</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>The engineered RSV G protein, with&#160;the RSV G antigen in orange and the human antibody in grey.&#160;<span>The arrow points to the place where the researchers engineered the antigen, doing so while not affecting its ability to bind to the antibody.</span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>This research is an important milestone in the pursuit of a vaccine against the virus that can cause severe respiratory disease in children and the elderly
</article-subhead><article-text><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Close interactions with infectious disease set both UC Santa Cruz graduate student Ana Nu&#241;ez Castrejon and Associate Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Rebecca DuBois on the path of studying respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common and sometimes dangerous respiratory disease for which there is not currently a vaccine. The two researchers recently marked a major milestone in their effort to create an effective vaccine for the virus with the publishing of their paper &#8220;Structure-based design and antigenic validation of respiratory syncytial virus G immunogens&#8221; in the <i>Journal of Virology</i>.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For fifth-year Baskin Engineering student and the paper&#8217;s lead author Nu&#241;ez Castrejon, a bout of pneumonia that lingered for months when she was an undergraduate student sparked her interest in studying respiratory illnesses. For DuBois, watching her child go through a serious infection of RSV, which can cause severe respiratory infections in infants/children and the elderly, led her to study the disease.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We have all of these wonderful childhood vaccines that have eliminated so much childhood disease, but there are still a lot of infectious diseases that are really tough on children, and RSV is one of those that causes hospitalizations in children,&#8221; DuBois said.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, the team focuses on bioengineering the structure of RSV&#8217;s G protein, which attaches the virus to host cells. The researchers altered the structure of the protein to eliminate its negative effects while still eliciting a protective response from the immune system in the form of antibodies that bind to the G protein.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The researcher&#8217;s <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33672319/"><span class="s2">2021 paper</span></a> showed that their engineered G protein was able to stimulate a stronger antibody response than the native G protein. However, it was unclear if the engineered G protein still &#8220;looked like&#8221; the native protein does on the surface of the virus. The newest study confirms that this engineered G protein looks the same and is recognized by human RSV-fighting antibodies.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;My paper shows that the engineered mutation in the protein doesn't disrupt the ability of antibodies to bind it, so when it is used as a vaccine antigen it is possible to elicit these protective antibodies in animal models, and hopefully in the future people will be protected from the disease,&#8221; Nu&#241;ez Castrejon said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This paper is similar to a 2017 publication crucial in the creation of the COVID-19 vaccine which described how to bioengineer the coronavirus&#8217;s Spike antigen to induce more and better antibodies, a strategy that was used to design the Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J, and Novavax vaccine Spike antigens. Both papers use structural biology to ensure that an engineered version of a virus can be recognized by the immune system to fight the actual virus.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;This is the same kind of foundational work that allowed scientists to design the coronavirus vaccine so quickly and enable it to look exactly like it does on the surface of the virus, and even better,&#8221; DuBois said. &#8220;I think what people are coming to realize is that we can make vaccines that stimulate immune responses that are better than you get from infection, if we can engineer the antigens in a way that really exposes the weaknesses of the virus.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Research in DuBois&#8217;s lab differs from other efforts to develop a RSV vaccine in their approach to studying the virus&#8217;s proteins. Many researchers are focused on altering the structure of the RSV F protein, which fuses the virus and host cell membranes together to get the virus&#8217;s genetic information into cells.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But late-stage clinical trials of vaccines using this approach show only a 60 to 70 percent protection against infection, which is promising but lower than what would be hoped for for an important pathogen like RSV.&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the short term, the researchers are looking to further analyze results from collaborators at the University of Georgia as to how their engineered protein affected disease symptoms in mice, and will continue to engineer the RSV G protein to produce stronger immune responses. In the next five years, they hope to develop an RSV vaccine using their engineered protein that is ready for clinical trials.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DuBois and Castrejon Nu&#241;ez are also collaborating with the biotechnology company Trellis Bioscience, which is investigating the use of monoclonal antibodies to treat infants with RSV infection and severe lung congestion.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

marine science research projects that address the agency&#8217;s priority themes of resilient coastal communities and economies, sustainable fisheries, and healthy coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>The UCSC graduate research fellows are taking novel approaches to answer diverse and important questions for California&#8217;s coastal communities and ecosystems, from the effects of wildfires on endangered salmon to the effects of sea level rise on critical infrastructure in socioeconomically disadvantaged San Francisco Bay regions.</p>
<p><strong>Genevieve Pugsley</strong>, an ocean sciences graduate student working with Professor of Ocean Sciences Matthew McCarthy, won funding for a project to study how marine phytoplankton communities in coastal California change with shifting climate. Climate variation affects the structure and productivity of coastal ecosystems, as well as the risk of dangerous and costly harmful algal blooms. Despite the need for knowledge about likely effects of changing climate on coastal ecosystem productivity and health, scientific understanding is limited by the relatively short duration of recent ecological monitoring efforts.</p>
<p>Pugsley&#8217;s research team is turning to paleoclimate records stored in deep sea coral skeletons and sediments. The aim is to adapt and validate an innovative new isotope ecology method for quantifying phytoplankton community changes in coastal marine environments, and then apply this isotope fingerprinting method to gain new insight into the influence of past climate change on phytoplankton community composition and algal bloom occurrence in central California.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Kobayashi</strong>, a Ph.D. candidate in ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB) working with EEB Professor Eric Palkovacs, is investigating the effects of wildfires on imperiled populations of salmon and steelhead. With climate change, the frequency and intensity of wildfires are increasing, which may significantly alter physical and ecological processes in stream ecosystems. Kobayashi&#8217;s project leverages data from a heavily-monitored watershed affected by a recent California wildfire to assess the consequences of fire for endangered coho salmon and threatened steelhead trout.</p>
<p>In collaboration with NOAA&#8217;s Scott Creek Salmonid Research and Monitoring Program, Kobayashi will explore whether fire will tip the balance between the energetic demands of salmonids and the amount of food supplied by the food web. Through its effects on physical habitat, wildfire could simultaneously impact both metabolic demand and food availability for young fish. If increased metabolic demand is accompanied by decreased food availability, then their growth and survival are threatened via a mechanism called &#8220;metabolic meltdown.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Julia Cheresh</strong>, a Ph.D. student advised by Associate Professor of Ocean Sciences Jerome Fiechter, won funding for her research on ocean acidification and hypoxia (low oxygen) in the California Current System. Ocean acidification and global oxygen decline are among the most concerning climate change-related threats to marine life. Their impacts are particularly pronounced in the California Current System due to natural exposure to lower pH and oxygen conditions during seasonal coastal upwelling.</p>
<p>Cheresh&#8217;s project will use global climate projections to characterize the 21st century progression of ocean acidification and hypoxia in the California Current, which is home to highly productive and biodiverse ecosystems with significant ecological, economic, and cultural importance. Projections and analyses will be used to develop an interactive web tool tailored toward the needs of resource managers.</p>
<p><strong>James Jacobs</strong>, a Ph.D. student in Earth and planetary sciences, is working with research scientist Adina Paytan to study the effects of sea level rise on critical wastewater and transit infrastructure in two low-income residential developments on the margin of San Francisco Bay. Flooding of wastewater infrastructure will increase with sea level rise, damaging pipes and pumps and causing sanitary sewer overflows and pipe backflows, all of which create human health exposure risks and environmental damage. Regular flooding of roads causes delays and damages transit infrastructure.</p>
<p>Jacobs&#8217; team will study two areas developed on the San Francisco Bay margin that have higher flood frequencies than similar nearby communities. These locations also reflect the intersection of socioeconomically disadvantaged areas with high flood vulnerability and critical wastewater and transit infrastructure that may be disproportionately impacted by sea level rise. Jacobs will collect field data to identify groundwater flooding, sewer overflows, and road flooding to better understand the short-term impacts. The team aims to provide real-time advance warnings to agencies and residents of impending sewer overflows and road flooding, as well as to identify sources of floodwaters.</p>
<p>California Sea Grant prioritizes supporting the next generation of early career scientists focusing on applied research.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When David Schulkin paddles into a wave off the Santa Cruz coastline, he sees more than just a curling tunnel of blue. He sees life.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He sees it in the way a surfer needs to have a plan going into the water but must be willing to shift or throw it away when conditions change. He sees it in the fact that putting a lot of effort into paddling only pays off if your timing is also right; that you have to stay sharp and be aware of every opportunity to catch a wave when it comes along.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A licensed psychotherapist in private practice by training and a longtime surf teacher for UC Santa Cruz's Adventure Rec program in the Department of Athletics and Recreation by calling, the 44-year-old Schulkin is someone, former student Ra&#250;l Betancourt said, who &#8220;is there on the path with you. He&#8217;s all about joy and about passing on the joy of surfing and of life in general.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Los Angeles native, Schulkin came to UC Santa Cruz drawn by the town vibe and the good, consistent waves nearby. He majored in psychology at Oakes College and graduated in 2000. Wanderlust took over, however, and Schulkin began traveling the globe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For five years, he taught at surf camps and with local surf school Club Ed, and, when the season was over, he would head out on his own. He caught waves in places like Japan, Indonesia, New Zealand, Samoa, Cook Islands, Tonga, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Hawaii. He even had a session in Israel.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was hungry for experiences. I was basically exploring my internal and external world,&#8221; Schulkin said and then laughed. &#8220;I have to give credit to my parents, who believed I would come back and eventually be a productive member of society.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day, he said, as he hitched a ride back from a surf spot in Chile, he thought suddenly: &#8220;What the hell am I doing?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He realized he wanted to invest in community instead of the individual-centered life he was pursuing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He came back to Santa Cruz, heard about the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in Palo Alto&#8212;now Sofia University&#8212;and thought psychotherapy was what he wanted to do with his life. While answering an ad for a room to rent back in Santa Cruz, he met his future wife Lindsay Knisely, who now teaches writing at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The stars just aligned,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this time, he taught surfing at UC Santa Cruz, first, as a TA and then as a lead instructor. He has taught the sport to UC Santa Cruz students for more than two decades, loading a van with students, wetsuits, and long, floaty foam boards and heading out to tame surf spots where he teaches the skills and mentality of the sport. For a while, the campus held a 10-day surf expedition to Baja, which Schulkin led.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betancourt (Merrill &#8217;99, history and chemistry), who teaches middle-school science in Honolulu, Hawaii, remembered the passion and support that Schulkin brought to his surf class and how the class allowed him to get out of his head for a little while amid the rigors of college life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was struggling during his first lesson, he said, repeatedly falling and being tumbled by the waves when Schulkin came up to him. &#8220;He said that surfing was hard but that I needed to keep trying,&#8221; Betancourt remembered.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That advice stuck with him and, during the next lesson, he caught his first wave. Schulkin, he said, began hooting and gave him a big high five. &#8220;He said, &#8216;Oh, you got it now. You got the bug now.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betancourt, 46, has been surfing ever since.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love to watch them stand up [on a wave] and be stoked,&#8221; Schulkin said of his students. &#8220;To see them on this knee-high wave and yelling, &#8216;Yeah!&#8217; It keeps the stoke fresh. It&#8217;s really so lovely to share that with them.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="75dab44a8072704664be42b4ad925b8c"><name>smoke-taint-wines</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Chemical analysis reveals effects of wildfire smoke on grapes and wines</title><summary>A new study provides practical guidelines for using biomarkers to identify ‘smoke taint’ in grapes and wines affected by the smoke from wildfires.</summary><keywords>Phil Crews</keywords><start-date>1646985600000</start-date><display-name>Chemical analysis reveals effects of wildfire smoke on grapes and wines</display-name><path>/2022/03/smoke-taint-wines</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/smoke-taint-wines</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1646949741578</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1647013183549</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/images/diagram-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/images/diagram-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>diagram-450.jpg</name><display-name>diagram-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>66829</file-size><width>450</width><height>285</height></image><image-alt>diagram shows origins of smoke taint</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/images/diagram-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/images/diagram-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>diagram-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>diagram-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21461</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>illustration of wine glass</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Wildfires produce volatile phenols which accumulate in grapes as phenol glycosides and give rise to unpleasant &#8220;smoke taint&#8221; in wines.

Volatile compounds in the smoke from wildfires can be absorbed by grapes and produce an unpleasant taste known as &#8220;smoke taint&#8221; in wines made from affected grapes.</p>
<p>A new study led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz provides valuable data and guidelines for using analytical chemistry to identify grapes and wines affected by smoke taint. <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.2c00028">Published March 3 in the <em>Journal of Natural Products</em></a>, the study is based on an analysis of more than 200 samples of grapes and wine from 21 grape-growing regions in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Lead author Phil Crews, a distinguished research professor of chemistry at UC Santa Cruz, is also a winemaker and owner of a small winery (Pelican Ranch Winery). He said the extent of the smoke taint problem came to his attention in the aftermath of the 2018 Mendocino Complex Fire, when large wineries began rejecting grapes from the affected region and Crews was retained as a consultant by legal firms representing wine professionals.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I discovered was that proper analytical data was not provided to figure out if the grapes or wines were affected by the smoke,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Crews found that the best research on the problem had been done at the Australian Wine Research Institute (AWRI), where researchers had identified an array of compounds that could be detected in affected grapes and wines and used as &#8220;biomarkers&#8221; of smoke taint. He also found that most U.S. labs used by the wine industry were not performing adequate measurements. He designed the new study to apply the Australian methods to grapes and wines from California and Oregon.</p>
<p>&#8220;This research is highly valuable, with the potential to save countless dollars, and is increasingly relevant in our world of drought and climate change,&#8221; said Eleni Papadakis, a winemaking consultant based in Portland, Oregon, who was not directly involved in the study, but helped connect Crews with Oregon winemakers and participated in frequent discussions. &#8220;I believe I speak for the whole of the winemaking community when I express the excitement and appreciation for the strong data and evidence-based guidance Professor Crews and his team have provided with this groundbreaking work,&#8221; she said.</p>
<h2>Direct measurement</h2>
<p>Crews&#8217;s approach emphasizes direct measurement of smoke-derived compounds in the form in which they are stored in the grapes. Previous studies have associated smoke taint with volatile phenols present in smoke from burning vegetation. These compounds are absorbed through the skin of ripening grapes and accumulate in the grapes, where they become bound to sugars to form nonvolatile compounds called phenolic diglycosides.</p>
<p>In the bound form, the phenolic compounds cannot be smelled or tasted, but the foul-tasting free phenols can be released by enzymes, either during fermentation of the wine or in the mouth by enzymes or bacteria present in saliva.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that the phenolic diglycosides are stable in cabernet sauvignon during bottle aging, but then during tasting the monomers that smell bad get released in the mouth,&#8221; Crews said.</p>
<p>According to Crews, it is important to measure the bound phenolic diglycosides directly. These large compounds are not readily detected with the standard methods used to analyze aroma and flavor compounds in wine (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, or GC/MS), but they can be measured using more sophisticated methods (ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography, or UHPLC, and quantitative mass spectrometry).</p>
<p>The new study provides some of the first quantitative measurements of phenolic diglycosides in premium California and Oregon grapes and wines, including eight different varietals harvested from 2017 to 2021. The results include baseline data for normal grapes, as well as grapes exposed to six different levels of natural wildfire smoke.</p>
<p>The analysis focused on six biomarkers recommended by AWRI as representative of the compounds associated with smoke taint. Representative biomarkers are needed to make testing practical because wood smoke contains hundreds of volatile compounds. The new findings indicated that two of the AWRI biomarkers were not useful, however, and Crews recommends replacing them with different biomarkers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are still major gaps in our understanding of these compounds, so more research is needed,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;But people can use these procedures now to look at a bottle of wine or a batch of grapes and tell if it&#8217;s likely to be affected by smoke taint.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his research lab at UC Santa Cruz, Crews focuses on the chemistry of tropical marine sponges and the identification of novel compounds active against cancer and other diseases. For the smoke taint study, he teamed up with a commercial testing lab, SC Laboratories in Santa Cruz, which has the staff and equipment needed to perform the analyses on a large scale.</p>
<p>Crews also reached out to Ryan Keiffer and Glenn McCourty at UC Cooperative Extension in Mendocino County, who helped obtain samples of grapes and wines for testing and are both coauthors of the paper. Other coauthors include Paul Dorenbach and Travis Ruthenburg at SC Laboratories; Gabriella Amberchan and Itzel Lizama-Chamu at UC Santa Cruz; and Erin McCauley at California State University, Dominguez Hills.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="75e760958072704664be42b442b4104c"><name>weems-performance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Professor Marianne Weems directs new interactive online performance I Agree To The Terms</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz Professor in Performance, Play &amp; Design Marianne Weems, Artistic Director and Founder of the award-winning performance and media ensemble The Builders Association, debuts a new interactive crossmedia performance, livestreaming online this March 25-April 3.</summary><start-date>1646899200000</start-date><display-name>weems-performance</display-name><path>/2022/03/weems-performance</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/weems-performance</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1646950572146</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1646951729016</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Nina Sazevich</name><title></title><phone/><email>nina@sazevichpr.com</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/thumbnail---weems.png</path><link>site://news/2022/thumbnail---weems.png</link><site>news</site><name>thumbnail---weems.png</name><display-name>thumbnail---weems.png</display-name><file-size>17349</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>I Agree to the Terms</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/weems-play.png</path><link>site://news/2022/weems-play.png</link><site>news</site><name>weems-play.png</name><display-name>weems-play.png</display-name><file-size>569916</file-size><width>750</width><height>750</height></image><image-alt>I agree to the terms</image-alt><image-caption><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Agree To The Terms</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explores the daily terms we agree to through our online engagement, and at what cost.</span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Professor in Performance, Play &amp; Design Marianne Weems, Artistic Director and Founder of the award-winning performance and media ensemble The Builders Association, debuts a new interactive crossmedia performance, livestreaming online this March 25-April 3. Presented by The Builders Association and NYU Skirball, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Agree To The Terms</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been developed in collaboration with a community of crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (a crowdsourcing website for businesses, owned and operated by Amazon) who discretely train the algorithms that influence our online experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most so-called &#8220;MTurk&#8221; workers are Americans living in rural areas where jobs are scarce. These workers earn from $1 to $100 a day in a vast, unregulated industry. Their assignments are repetitive, boring, maddening, and sometimes disturbing. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Agree To The Terms</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> considers the invisible labor of these human &#8216;micro-workers&#8217; who shape artificial intelligence.&#160;</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the performance, audience members enter the online Builders Marketplace and, with the guidance of a crowdworker, will attempt to complete as many Human Intelligence Tasks as possible while being timed and rated and ultimately paid (in virtual Builders Coin). The 45-minute encounter is an opportunity to connect with an online labor force and to feature the humans in the loop of our everyday virtual encounters.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Internet was once seen as an innovation with the potential of bringing communities together, but has become a largely isolating world capitalizing our labor, our attention, and our identities,&#8221; says Weems. &#8220;As the need for new survival strategies grows in an expanding global economy, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Agree To The Terms</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explores the daily terms we agree to through our online engagement, and at what cost.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1994, The Builders Association, led by Weems, has created 17 original large-scale productions. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said, &#8220;The Builders Association makes other multimedia theater look as if it&#8217;s from the Stone Age.&#8221; The Builders have been recognized both in the U.S. and internationally as leaders of theatrical innovation, incorporating actors with every form of media to create interdisciplinary, multi-dimensional performances. Creating original productions based on stories drawn from contemporary life, the company uses new and old tools to extend the boundaries of theater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weems came to UCSC in 2017 and leads Future Stages, a two-year MFA research group in Digital Arts and New Media that delves into tools and techniques for exploring how crossmedia practice can expand on basic theatrical relationships in new and culturally relevant ways. Several of her students assisted with the development of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Agree To The Terms.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It would be impossible to overstate the impact that Professor Marianne Weems has had on the development of the new department of Performance, Play &amp; Design,&#8221; says Department Chair and Professor Michael Chemers. &#8220;As one of the United States' most celebrated and most innovative directors of experimental theater, Marianne has a long and accomplished history of uniting live performance with digital technology. This knowledge, coupled with Marianne's deep commitment to the students of UCSC, has energized and guided our efforts to create this combined department where our dedication to the art of performance is deeply enriched by an embrace of gaming and playfulness. Thanks in no small part to Marianne's vision, we are training a new generation of theatrical innovators that are just as much at home in the digital world as they are in the world of live performance."</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/internationalization/ucsc-strategic-plan-for-internationalization.pdf">Strategic Plan for Internationalization</a> (SPI) and corresponding <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/internationalization/spi-implementation.pdf">implementation plan</a> are living, evolving documents that are the result of the campus&#8217;s participation in the <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/internationalization/ace/index.html">American Council on Education&#8217;s (ACE) Internationalization Laboratory</a>.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is advancing comprehensive <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/internationalization/index.html">internationalization</a> to ensure that the members of the campus community &#8212; students, faculty, and staff &#8212; are prepared and encouraged to study, teach, conduct research, and work in a global context, and that institutional policies, programs, and initiatives are aligned to achieve this shared goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;The important issues of our day do not stop at international borders,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;Communities across the globe are already deeply connected via social media, commerce, and higher education. It is important that our community of students and scholars problem-solve on a global scale, advance the well-being of people and places worldwide, and value the diversity of thought that a strong internationalization plan provides.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opportunities have already been launched as part of the SPI during the pandemic to expand equity and access to global learning for UCSC students as well as innovative virtual teaching opportunities for faculty.</p>
<h2>Global Classrooms expand access</h2>
<p>In fall 2021, four <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/partnerships/initiatives/global-classrooms/index.html">Global Classrooms</a> were launched, which paired students in a UCSC classroom with students in classrooms in Kenya, Colombia, and China to work virtually on joint projects. The fall courses were delivered by Merrill College Provost Elizabeth Abrams, lecturer Melvin Cox, Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Alvaro Cardenas, and Assistant Professor of Linguistics Jess Law.</p>
<p>Three additional Global Classrooms are being offered this winter quarter by Professor of Politics Matthew Sparke, Coordinator of the Right Livelihood College David Shaw, Professor of Art Beth Stevens, and Continuing Lecturer of Anthropology Annapurna Pandey. In spring, courses will be delivered by Associate Professor of Computational Media Angus Forbes, and Professor of Digital Art and New Media Jennifer Parker.</p>
<p>The faculty teaching the Global Classrooms received training in Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) to create successful models for class to class engagement in the virtual space. The <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/partnerships/initiatives/global-classrooms/call-for-applications.html">Call for Applications</a> is now open for the next round of Global Classrooms and faculty are encouraged to consider this opportunity to expand access to global learning through technology.</p>
<h2>Virtual Student Exchange builds connections with Pacific Rim Universities</h2>
<p>Through its membership with the Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU) UC Santa Cruz is part of a <a href="https://globallearning.ucsc.edu/programs/ucsc-apru-vse/index.html">Virtual Student Exchange</a> (VSE), which allows students to take online courses at top universities around the Pacific Rim for UC credit as part of their full time enrollment. In exchange, students at those universities are allowed to enroll in online courses offered at UCSC.</p>
<p>Alan Christy&#8217;s <a href="https://pisa.ucsc.edu/class_search/index.php?action=detail&amp;class_data=YToyOntzOjU6IjpTVFJNIjtzOjQ6IjIyMTgiO3M6MTA6IjpDTEFTU19OQlIiO3M6NToiMjQyMDgiO30%253D">History and Memory in the Okinawan Islands</a> course was described by a virtual exchange student from the University of Auckland as &#8220;incredibly satisfying and fulfilling. It is not every course that you leave feeling that you truly have knowledge of the subject in question that will stay with you wherever you go next. I believe this is largely attributable to the deep, unparalleled knowledge that the instructor wielded, as well as the high-quantity, high-quality assessments and research materials that the teaching staff compiled.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next opportunity for students to participate in the VSE is spring 2022. Students can learn more on <a href="https://globallearning.ucsc.edu/programs/ucsc-apru-vse/index.html">the Global Learning website</a>. Faculty interested in offering their online course as part of this program in fall 2022 can look out for the next call for course submissions in the spring quarter.</p>
<h2>Virtual Global Internships to continue in 2022</h2>
<p><a href="https://globallearning.ucsc.edu/programs/global-internships/virtual-internships/index.html">Virtual Global Internships</a> were offered for students in summer 2021 as a pilot program and will continue into summer 2022. Interns were placed virtually with host organizations located in Canada, China, Colombia, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. While interning, students also enrolled in summer courses offered by Languages and Applied Linguistics, and Cowell and Rachel Carson colleges. Expansion to in-person internships abroad in summer 2022 will launch specifically for psychology students in Spain and Portugal through a collaboration between the academic department and Global Engagement. These experiential learning opportunities, both virtual and in an international setting, are helping us achieve the Beyond the Classroom priority of our Student Success Initiative.</p>
<h2>In-person internships to bring international students to UCSC</h2>
<p><a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/partnerships/initiatives/isrp.html">The International Summer Research Internship</a> (ISRP) launched virtually in summer 2021 through a collaboration with Baskin School of Engineering and Global Engagement. This summer the research internships will be in person, bringing top undergraduate students to UC Santa Cruz from partner universities abroad to work in research labs alongside students and faculty. Participants praised the practical benefits of learning how to work as part of an international team, and the value that this research experience imparts on their future academic and career plans. Faculty have the opportunity to participate in this program as UC Santa Cruz expands ISRP in summer 2023 and beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comprehensive internationalization requires engagement and commitment from all levels of the university leadership, faculty, and staff across campus,&#8221; said Vice Provost Richard Hughey. &#8220;We urge all who are interested in this effort to visit our <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/internationalization/index.html">Internationalization website</a>. There, you will find details about the Strategic Plan, the implementation timeline, progress made on the goals, and more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope faculty, staff and students will take part in bringing a global perspective to our campus goals of teaching, research, and service,&#8221; said Hughey. &#8220;We cannot solve global problems such as public health, climate change, and world food shortages without international research and cooperation.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7ad1d9258072704664be42b42650a6b8"><name>campus-tours-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Campus Tours Update</title><summary>Recently, we have been carefully resuming our in-person tours, as you may have seen around the campus.

We have responded with</span><a href="https://admissions.ucsc.edu/uc-santa-cruz-campus/visit-ucsc"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a variety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of online, YouTube-based, and self-guided options over the last two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, we have been carefully resuming our in-person tours, as you may have seen around the campus. The tours are outdoors and serve a limited number of people per group.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we enter our Spring Yield phase with</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/02/fall-2022-applications.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a record number of applicants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once again, we are prioritizing admitted students and their families for in-person tours. Shortly after receiving their admission notification, students will also receive a link that will allow them to sign up for tours. After yield season ends, we expect to gradually increase our in-person tour options and open them to the general public, health conditions permitting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the in-person tours, we will host a range of virtual activities for our admitted students and families, including Banana Slug Day on April 16, an all-online experience that will offer many opportunities for students to connect with our faculty and staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your flexibility and grace as we navigate the process of reopening tours and offering the best possible experience for our admitted students and families, while continuing to stay safe.</span></p>

(Photo by Ira Block/National Geographic)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>New findings reveal a precursor event before the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, giving scientists a fresh perspective on future global climate scenarios</article-subhead><article-text><p>A massive release of greenhouse gases, likely triggered by volcanic activity, caused a period of extreme global warming known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) about 56 million years ago. A new study now confirms that the PETM was preceded by a smaller episode of warming and ocean acidification caused by a shorter burst of carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The new findings, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg1025">published March 16 in <em>Science Advances</em></a>, indicate that the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere during this precursor event was about the same as the current cumulative carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities. As a result, the short-lived precursor event represents what might happen if current emissions can be shut down quickly, while the much more extreme global warming of the PETM shows the consequences of continuing to release carbon into the atmosphere at the current rate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a short-lived burp of carbon equivalent to what we&#8217;ve already released from anthropogenic emissions,&#8221; said coauthor James Zachos, professor of Earth and planetary sciences and Ida Benson Lynn Chair of Ocean Health at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;If we turned off emissions today, that carbon would eventually get mixed into the deep sea and its signal would disappear, because the deep-sea reservoir is so huge.&#8221;</p>
<p>This process would take hundreds of years&#8212;a long time by human standards, but short compared to the tens of thousands of years it took for Earth&#8217;s climate system to recover from the more extreme PETM.</p>
<p>The new findings are based on an analysis of marine sediments that were deposited in shallow waters along the U.S. Atlantic coast and are now part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. At the time of the PETM, sea levels were higher, and much of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey were under water. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has drilled sediment cores from this region which the researchers used for the study.</p>
<h2>Foraminifera</h2>
<p>The PETM is marked in marine sediments by a major shift in carbon isotope composition and other evidence of dramatic changes in ocean chemistry as a result of the ocean absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The marine sediments contain the microscopic shells of tiny sea creatures called foraminifera that lived in the surface waters of the ocean. The chemical composition of these shells records the environmental conditions in which they formed and reveals evidence of warmer surface water temperatures and ocean acidification.</p>
<p>First author Tali Babila began the study as a postdoctoral fellow working with Zachos at UC Santa Cruz and is now at the University of Southampton, U.K. Novel analytical methods developed at Southampton enabled the researchers to analyze the boron isotope composition of individual foraminifera to reconstruct a detailed record of ocean acidification. This was part of a suite of geochemical analyses they used to reconstruct environmental changes during the precursor event and the main PETM.</p>
<p>&#8220;Previously, thousands of foraminifera fossil shells were needed for boron isotope measurement. Now we are able to analyze a single shell that&#8217;s only the size of a grain of sand,&#8221; Babila said.</p>
<p>Evidence of a precursor warming event had been identified previously in sediments from the continental section at Big Horn Basin in Wyoming and a few other sites. Whether it was a global signal remained unclear, however, as it was absent from deep-sea sediment cores. Zachos said this makes sense because sedimentation rates in the deep ocean are slow, and the signal from a short-lived event would be lost due to mixing of sediments by bottom-dwelling marine life.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best hope for seeing the signal would be in shallow marine basins where sedimentation rates are higher,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The problem there is that deposition is episodic and erosion is more likely. So there&#8217;s not a high likelihood of capturing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The USGS and others have drilled numerous sediment cores (or sections) along the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The researchers found that the PETM is present in all of those sections, and several also capture the precursor event. Two sections from Maryland (at South Dover Bridge and Cambridge-Dover Airport) are the focus of the new study.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we have the full signal, and a couple of other locations capture part of it. We believe it&#8217;s the same event they found in the Bighorn Basin,&#8221; Zachos said.</p>
<p>Based on their analyses, the team concluded that the precursor signal in the Maryland sections represents a global event that probably lasted for a few centuries, or possibly several millennia at most.</p>
<p>The two carbon pulses&#8212;the short-lived precursor and the much larger and more prolonged carbon emissions that drove the PETM&#8212;led to profoundly different mechanisms and time scales for the recovery of the Earth&#8217;s carbon cycle and climate system. The carbon absorbed by the surface waters during the precursor event got mixed into the deep ocean within a thousand years or so. The carbon emissions during the PETM, however, exceeded the buffering capacity of the ocean, and removal of the excess carbon depended on much slower processes such as the weathering of silicate rocks over tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p>Zachos noted that there are important differences between Earth&#8217;s climate system today and during the Paleocene&#8212;notably the presence of polar ice sheets today, which increase the sensitivity of the climate to greenhouse warming.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda Quirk pulled off a feat of galactic proportions at this year&#8217;s</span><a href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/events/grad-slam/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Grad Slam </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">competition in downtown Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She compressed billions of years of galaxies&#8217; history into a&#160; humor-laced three-minute mini-talk, drawing cheers from the audience and winning over the judges with her discussion of galaxy mergers and &#8220;galactic cannibalism.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the competition held at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center, Quirk&#8217;s presentation, &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tale of Two Galaxies: Studying How Galaxies Change Over Time,&#8221;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">won $3,000 and the opportunity to compete in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the systemwide UC Grad Slam on May 6 in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next stop for Quirk is Columbia University, where she earned her B.A. in astrophysics in 2017. She will be a teaching post-doc in astronomy for the next three years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grad Slam gives graduate students three minutes to share their research, concisely and compellingly, with a public audience. Currently enrolled graduate students are eligible to participate, with the exception of previous winners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A community panel of leaders in government and the nonprofit sector judged the event. The audience was invited to vote on its favorite presentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grad Slam has a great track record when it comes to fostering unforgettable presentations. The 2019 winner,&#160; Sarah Kienle, turned the sexual dimophism and foraging differences of male and female elephant seals into comedic gold. The UC Santa Cruz Grad Slam champion of 2017, John Felts, earned top marks for his talk about creating environmentally friendly surfboard foam from the shells of shrimp.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The competition is always fierce, and the challenge is formidable. How do you cram years of knowledge into an elevator pitch while keeping the audience engaged?&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Spying on stars</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Quirk, in the words of Sonya Newlyn, professional development coordinator for the Department of Graduate Studies, gave &#8220;a star performance with a presentation that demonstrated poise, wit, and skillful timing. It was a delight to watch and listen to.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quirk is a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate,working with Professor Puragra Guha Thakurta, who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had high praise for Quirk&#8217;s presentation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am very happy to see her go from one success to another,&#8221; said Thakurta, professor and chair of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department. &#8220;She is a terrific scientist, educator, mentor, and communicator. It has been a privilege to work with her as we explore the mysteries of our neighboring Andromeda and Triangulum galaxies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her presentation began with a vexing problem: &#8220;If we were to truly study a galaxy&#8217;s life, we would need billions of years to watch it form and grow. Now, that is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">way </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">longer than I plan on being in graduate school.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To figure out how galaxies change over time, astronomers must look for clues that represent &#8220;tiny snapshots&#8217;&#8217; in their history, Quirk explained.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A whole lot can happen to a galaxy in a few billion years, including the energetic deaths of massive stars, the violent burst of star formations, and collisions between galaxies,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quirk is especially interested in galaxy mergers or galactic cannibalism&#8212;a colorful term for mergers that tear apart smaller galaxies while building up larger ones, a process that changes how galaxies function and behave.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her research focuses on the relatively close-to-Earth Triangulum and Andromeda galaxies, which she studies by using data gathered with the help of the Keck II telescope, one of the largest telescopes on Earth, to observe their stars. Keck II is located on Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Stars are gossips,&#8221; Quirk told the crowd. &#8220;They give away many of their secrets through their light.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quirk compares how fast younger and older stars move and makes note of the differences, especially if one is moving much more quickly than the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If there is a noticeable difference in their speed, it means that something must have happened to the galaxy in the time between when the young and older stars were born," she said. &#8220;That something could be a merger.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using this comparative technique, Quirk found that the Andromeda galaxy likely had a major merger at some point in the past 4 billion years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This actually changes what we know about the kinds of mergers that spiral galaxies can survive,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quirk explained that spiral galaxies&#8212;named for their beautiful spiral structure&#8212;are relatively fragile. When one collides with a bigger galaxy, &#8220;the spiral pattern can be destroyed, and you get an elliptical galaxy that looks just like a blob.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quirk, spying on the stars in Triangulum, noticed that there was not much difference between the speeds of its older and younger stars, suggesting that so far, Triangulum has been left alone by the smaller galaxies that have passed by recently. But it won&#8217;t stay that way forever. Triangulum will collide with Andromeda in billions of years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also noted that our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is also on a crash course with Andromeda at some point in the far future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We won&#8217;t be around to watch that merger but the work I&#8217;m doing today gives us a glimpse into the future of our own galactic home,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about winning the competition, Quirk said it was an honor, but she mostly wanted to talk about how much she enjoyed the other presentations.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because in the Astronomy Department, I am so used to just hearing about astronomy that I forget all about the amazing research that&#8217;s being done on the campus,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I loved hearing about what other grad students are doing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#160;<strong>A strong advocate for students with disabilities</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from her scientific prowess, Quirk is known at UCSC for her compassion and common cause with disabled scientists. She has been living for years with chronic pain, which can be incapacitating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She convened a support group for disabled grad students to come together and talk about their experiences. She also communicates with her department and others across the university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We talk about how to make classrooms more flexible in their structures so students with chronic health issues can honor their bodies instead of just prioritizing classroom learning,&#8221; Quirk said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group has been a boon for Quirk.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been really comforting just to know that I&#8217;m not alone in this, and to hear about other students&#8217; experiences,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It broadened my horizons.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>An impressive field of Grad Slam competitors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jessica Kendall-Barr,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a fifth-year ecology and evolutionary biology Ph.D. candidate, was the runner-up award winner with her presentation, &#8220;Eavesdropping on the Brain at Sea: A First Glimpse at Sleep in Wild Marine Mammals.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Melissa Marini &#352;vigelj, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">a fourth-year education Ph.D candidate, was the People&#8217;s Choice winner, getting the audience in her corner with the presentation, &#8220;The Limitations and Potentialities of Educational Civil Rights Protections under IDEA for Incarcerated Children.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other finalists were </span><strong>Elise Duffau, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">psychology Ph.D., third year, &#8220;The Particularities of Politeness&#8221;,&#160; </span><strong>Sara Gonzalez,&#160; </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecology and evolutionary biology Ph.D., sixth year, &#8220;Untangling Giant Kelp: Causes and Consequences of Different Shapes&#8221;, &#160;</span><strong>Andrea Paz-Lacavex, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">coastal science and policy M.S., second year, &#8220;SPORA: Rockin&#8217; Kelp Restoration&#8221;, <strong>Ontario Alexander,</strong> musicology Ph.D., 1st year, &#8220;Joseph Boulogne: Restoring a legend&#8221;, and <strong>Amanda Carbajal,</strong> molecular, cellular, and developmental biology, track in biomedical science and engineering Ph.D., 4th year, &#8220;Leveraging biotechnology and basic science to stay a step ahead of the next global pandemic.&#8221;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Starting in fall 2022, Early Education Services (EES) is planning to reopen its infant care program and expand its operating hours. Successfully increasing the level of service requires us to hire additional teachers and teaching assistants. EES is already working with Staff Human Resources to start the recruitments. When additional staffing is in place, planned operating hours for EES for fall 2022 will be expanded to 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; current operating hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The success of our students continues to be one of our highest priorities. Student parents and faculty supporters have advocated for this support. We understand the challenge student parents face in balancing their educational pursuits while caring for, or seeking care for, very young children. This expansion of staff, service and hours will provide additional resources to support their family and academic needs.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This fall, we anticipate being able to provide care for up to six infants between the ages of 11 and 24 months. As staff and space permits in our toddler program and as infants are ready, they will begin transitioning as early as 18 months.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The need for back-up care &#8212; both child care and elder care &#8212; is critical for our employees and students, and we have been working to provide more support and resources over the past year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Through a partnership with Bright Horizons, we are now able to provide </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/01/back-up-care-services.html"><span>subsidized back-up care for employees and students as well as access to virtual tutoring and camps</span></a><span>. Additionally, the Student Affairs and Success website includes a page that provides a list of links to </span><a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/students-as-parents/index.html"><span>programs and resources</span></a><span> that may be helpful for student parents.</span></p>

<p><strong>Effective April 10, masks will not be required for most indoor settings at UC Santa Cruz facilities, but their use will still be strongly recommended.</strong> We chose this date to relax the masking requirement to allow time for the campus community to test following spring break, <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html%23springbreakreturn&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1647467153859000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1-LA6pSwlUyKCr7q-jtVpe" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html#springbreakreturn" rel="noopener" target="_blank">per our protocol.</a> Masks will still be required on campus public transportation, in the Early Education Services centers, and in clinical settings, such as the Student Health Center and at indoor COVID-19 testing sites.</p>
<p>While not required, indoor masking remains <em>strongly recommended</em> by campus leadership and local public health officials regardless of an individual&#8217;s vaccination status. We also support those who wish to continue masking, such as those who are immunocompromised or otherwise concerned about their health while on campus. Free surgical and KN95 masks will continue to be distributed at <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1647467153859000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vDDgRvbpKnEauu3UFszY2" href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/covid-resources.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">various campus locations</a>.

We believe that our 2021 Long Range Development Plan, informed by four years of collaborative discussion with campus and community members before unanimous approval by the UC Board of Regents in September, represents that balance.</p>
<p>We are disappointed by these lawsuits, and had hoped to avoid litigation by entering into an agreement with the city and county prior to the plan&#8217;s approval in order to provide additional time for parties to identify and address reasonable concerns. Those focused conversations began in earnest last fall, but did not achieve the resolution that we had hoped for.</p>
<p>Campus leaders will continue to work closely with local elected leaders on many areas of shared interest and concern. We will continue to focus our energies on creating the housing and academic spaces our campus needs to fulfill our mission and furthering initiatives that advance student success and the impact of our research. We look forward to continuing our dialogue with community leaders and receiving feedback about future projects that support the objectives outlined in our 2021 LRDP. Proposed campus projects will have opportunities for stakeholder input through the rigorous planning, design, and environmental review processes.</p>
<p>We believe our 2021 Long Range Development Plan is a win for our campus and a win for our community. It is a well thought-out, comprehensive plan that will serve as a blueprint for our physical development over the next two decades. It utilizes a compact footprint for teaching, learning, research, housing and student support spaces. It plans to expand housing for 100 percent of new full-time student enrollment above 19,500 and includes plans for housing for up to 25 percent of new employees based on demand. It improves circulation on campus with new bikeways and pedestrian paths, focusing on alternative modes of transportation to reduce single-occupancy car trips. The future imagined by the LRDP is an inclusive one that supports the university&#8217;s mission and is respectful of our environment and the greater Santa Cruz County community.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="99fd7b1a8072704664be42b458d144df"><name>health-center-closure</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Upcoming closure for Student Health Center, SHOP  and CAPS</title><summary>Student Health Services—Student Health Center, CAPS, and SHOP will be closing early the afternoon of Thursday, March 24, 2022 from 12 PM–5 PM for Staff Development. &#13;

The </span><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, released as a draft in February, offers new insights on global climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rittelmeyer worked with an international team of 75 contributing authors, 10 lead authors, and 2 coordinating lead authors on </span><a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg2/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_Chapter04.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the report, which focuses on water. She joined the project in spring of 2020, while she was completing her Ph.D. in environmental studies at UCSC. Over a period of about two months, she and a group of other contributing authors each read and coded more than 100 case studies as part of a review of global research on the effectiveness of water-related climate adaptation efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a lot of work, and my dissertation actually ended up getting pushed back a couple of months because of this, but I am really glad I did it,&#8221; Rittelmeyer said. &#8220;I met some great people through working on the IPCC report, and now, looking at Chapter 4, I can see our work sprinkled throughout, which is really cool.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rittelmeyer additionally worked with a smaller team to summarize specific examples from the research review that showed how communities are adapting to water-related climate change disasters. Her own dissertation research was on flood risk in California, so the IPCC project allowed her to take a broader, global view of climate-related water issues.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The case studies we reviewed had to do with climate change impacts that bring either too little or too much water, so it was everything from droughts to floods to soil erosion to lack of clean, safe, affordable water,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We were examining these issues in Africa, Southeast Asia, Small Island Developing States, and other places around the world, and we wanted to understand how communities are responding.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An aspect that the IPCC team was particularly interested in was whether approaches to adaptation were incorporating Indigenous, local, or traditional knowledge, and if key stakeholders, including women and marginalized groups, were engaged in decision-making processes. The report recognizes these measures as being essential for building effective, equitable, and just adaptation strategies.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Marginalized communities, particularly in parts of the Global South, are some of the most vulnerable populations that are experiencing climate change consequences first, and we wanted to make sure that their points of view and ways of knowing are being incorporated,&#8221; Rittelmeyer said. &#8220;These communities are already encountering the need to adapt to water-related climate change, and they're already taking steps.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important aspect of the research was looking for measures of effectiveness, specifically which risks were being reduced, in adaptation responses. Rittelmeyer said this was a challenge, because many case studies were focused more on the planning processes for adaptation than evaluating the outcomes of the adaptation response. Some studies did have clear numerical data on the risk reduction, and others offered qualitative data that required careful discussion and interpretation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adaptation processes&#8212;like migrating to cities from flood-prone rural areas, or changing crop varieties and irrigation practices in response to drought&#8212;are complex, and effectiveness may differ over the short-run and the long-term. Rittelmeyer hopes the new IPCC report will encourage more research into the effectiveness of water-related climate change adaptations. But she also notes that the challenges often reflect those of adaptation itself.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s tricky because, in many cases, we won&#8217;t really know if the steps we&#8217;re taking today have been effective until decades from now,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And with climate change, we don&#8217;t have the time to wait.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="adaa55af8072704664be42b4789b74c8"><name>fire-risk-high</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Campus fire risk remains high</title><summary>With firefighters responding to three fires at UC Santa Cruz over the past several weeks, we want to remind the campus community that wildfire poses a serious and potentially devastating threat to our campus. &#13;

<p>Principal investigator Jeremy Sanford, professor of MCD biology, launched a pilot program in 2017 which provided research experience for 35 students while fulfilling laboratory course requirements for majors in the department. The program was interrupted by the pandemic, but it&#8217;s been up and running again this year. With the new funding from NSF, Sanford and co-principal investigator Guido Bordignon plan to establish four new faculty-led CURE labs for up to 100 students.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal is not just to expand research opportunities for students, but to expand opportunities for students to see themselves as scientists and to understand science as a tool and an approach for solving problems rather than a set of facts to learn,&#8221; Sanford said.</p>
<p>This is especially valuable for students from underrepresented groups or who are the first in their families to attend college, said Bordignon, a teaching professor in MCD biology. Longitudinal studies of student cohorts show performance disparities related to ethnicity, gender, and other demographic factors, especially in large lecture classes. But those disparities are much smaller in lab classes, and CURE labs can help shrink the gap even further.</p>
<p>&#8220;By allowing students to take ownership of a research project, it gives a strong boost to their &#8216;science identity&#8217; and can help address the equity gap,&#8221; Bordignon said. &#8220;It allows them to work closely with a professor, who is now someone beside them in the lab, not just teaching but discussing things with them, so students get to know their professor better and it gives them more confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sanford noted that each faculty member brings their own perspective and research questions to the courses, so the students are working on projects related to their professor&#8217;s research program. &#8220;The students feel like they&#8217;re contributing to something important, and it&#8217;s exciting for the professor too when you can expand your research group by 20 or 30 brains,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some of their ideas may be naive, but you can see their enthusiasm and see them making progress, so it&#8217;s really rewarding and energizing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a win-win for everyone involved, including the teaching assistants, who get to support the class as part of a research project,&#8221; added Bordignon.</p>
<p>The program will include assessments of student progress and examine its impact on student achievement, including retention and graduation rates. &#8220;This kind of evidence-based teaching can be transformative,&#8221; Bordignon said.</p>
<p>Sanford said the partnership with Bordignon is important because, as a teaching professor, Bordignon brings expertise in pedagogy that Sanford doesn&#8217;t have. &#8220;The idea of aligning teaching and research is a major strength of this program, and by fulfilling requirements for the major it&#8217;s not adding to the workload,&#8221; Sanford said.</p>
<p>Another component of the program will focus on developing partnerships with biotechnology companies in Silicon Valley to provide summer internships for students. The internships will provide not only additional research experience but also networking opportunities that can help students in their careers after graduation.</p>
<p>The pilot program has been funded by a gift from UCSC alumnus George Kraw, along with campus support for renovating lab space in Thimann Laboratories. The new funding is through NSF&#8217;s Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at Hispanic Serving Institutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to leverage the support from a donor to begin to grow the program,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;By expanding the number of labs over the next three years, we will get a lot of data on student success. The goal is to use that data to demonstrate the value of the program and get additional support to implement it more broadly. The notion of being able to offer ten CURE labs isn&#8217;t insane. We&#8217;ve expanded the number of MCD faculty, and I think we can pull it off.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="aed96c528072704664be42b4eba7d17a"><name>fairlie-ppp-testimony</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Economics Professor Rob Fairlie testifies before committee in U.S. House of Representatives to share research on Paycheck Protection Program </title><summary>Fairlie testified on his latest research, which showed that changes to the Paycheck Protection Program in 2021 helped to improve racial equity in loan distribution.</summary><start-date>1647846000000</start-date><path>/2022/03/fairlie-ppp-testimony</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/fairlie-ppp-testimony</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1647905958971</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1647905958971</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Research</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/08/images/rob-fairlie-300px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/08/images/rob-fairlie-300px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rob-fairlie-300px.jpg</name><display-name>rob-fairlie-300px.jpg</display-name><file-size>168973</file-size><width>435</width><height>298</height></image><image-alt>Rob Fairlie standing in a hallway at UC Santa Cruz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/08/images/fairlie-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/08/images/fairlie-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fairlie-80px.jpg</name><display-name>fairlie-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>14014</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Rob Fairlie headshot</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Fairlie testified on his latest research, which showed that changes to the Paycheck Protection Program in 2021 helped to improve racial equity in loan distribution.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 16, Economics Professor Rob Fairlie <a href="https://smallbusiness.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=4195">testified</a> before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Small Business. Fairlie was invited to share findings from his latest research, which examines demographic trends in who benefited from the $278 billion distributed through the third round of the Paycheck Protection Program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) in March 2020 in an effort to keep small businesses afloat during the pandemic and prevent layoffs. The program offered government-backed, forgivable loans through third-party lenders to help cover payroll costs and certain other business expenses. Initial funding ran out in weeks, so a second round was authorized in April of 2020, followed by a third round from January to May of 2021.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early research on the program, including Fairlie&#8217;s own prior work, had revealed that, while minority-owned businesses were particularly hard-hit by the economic impacts of the pandemic, minority communities received disproportionately less support through the first round of PPP loans. This disparity started to improve as financial institutions beyond large, traditional banks became more involved in the second round. And the third round, in 2021, sought to address initial disparities with program changes&#8212;like priority application periods, reserved funds, and second loan opportunities&#8212;all targeted to serving the smallest and most vulnerable businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie&#8217;s newest research set out to determine if these changes improved racial equity in the amount and number of PPP loans received in communities across the country. Fairlie and his coauthor, University of Nevada, Reno Associate Professor Frank Fossen, had initially embarked on this study at the request of the U.S. Senate. The final paper is forthcoming in the American Economic Association journal </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Papers and Proceedings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but a working version was shared in February by the </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29732"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Bureau of Economic Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and cited in a White House </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/11/fact-sheet-new-data-show-progress-on-biden-harris-commitment-to-equity-in-emergency-small-business-relief/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fact sheet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on March 11, prior to Fairlie&#8217;s testimony. Fairlie believes the study&#8217;s findings are encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our research shows that, In 2021, the program did a much better job with equity issues,&#8221; Fairlie said. &#8220;It targeted disadvantaged communities and business owners through several new procedures under the Biden Administration, and we found strong evidence that the funds were actually dispersed to minority communities, as intended.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the research identified a strong positive relationship between receipt of PPP loans and minority share in a community, across several different means of measurement. This finding contrasted substantially with prior rounds of the program. The first round showed a negative relationship between minority share in a community and loan support, while the second round showed a slight positive relationship. By the third round, loan support was successfully reaching both businesses with employees and the self-employed in minority communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the paper also notes that the positive relationship between loans and minority share of the community was stronger for businesses taking out their first loan than their second. Fairlie says this may reflect some persistence in racial inequalities from earlier in the program, since getting a second loan was only possible for businesses that had already received an initial loan.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie shared these findings during his testimony before the Committee on Small Business and also discussed a related trend that has shown up in his research and in the work of others. He said more banks and financial institutions were involved in the third round of loans, especially online lenders, known as &#8220;fintech&#8221; companies, and community development financial institutions (CDFIs), which specialize in lending to underserved communities. Fairlie believes this helped to reach businesses in minority communities, and that lesson could inform future recovery efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need to continue to provide access to capital for struggling businesses, and one method to do this is to increase the range of financial institutions, both geographically and by type,&#8221; Fairlie said during his testimony. &#8220;Increasing involvement of a wider range of financial institutions appears to have helped improve access to loans for communities of color.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Dean Phillips, who chaired proceedings for the hearing, thanked Fairlie and other experts for their testimony and expressed a desire to apply lessons to future initiatives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It's heartening to see that the changes Congress did institute had a profound effect on entrepreneurs that were initially shut out of PPP,&#8221; Phillips said during the hearing. &#8220;It's also vital that we take the lessons learned from the PPP program and apply them to current and future [Small Business Administration] programs. Making these programs more accessible and equitable will ensure that more entrepreneurs can pursue their dreams and that all small businesses have a chance not just to survive but to thrive.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b2b7d4c58072704664be42b4c4694cbf"><name>2022-food-truck</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Spring Break 2022 Food Truck-A-Thon</title><summary>The UCSC Spring Break 2022 Food Truck-A-Thon will take place March 19-27</summary><start-date>1647932400000</start-date><path>/2022/03/2022-food-truck</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/2022-food-truck</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1647970866353</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1647982177678</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Abby Butler</name><title></title><phone/><email>ajbutler@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC Spring Break 2022 Food Truck-A-Thon will take place March 19-27 at the following locations:</span></p>

<p><strong>Congratulations to our winners, and thank you to all that participated in the Alumni Survey.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marion Howard Hoekenga, better known by her friends as &#8220;Happy&#8221; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Cowell &#8217;69, History, Art History), </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was one of the first students to set foot on the UC Santa Cruz campus when it opened its doors in 1965.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new UC campus was still a radical idea while Howard Hoekenga was growing up in San Mateo, but</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she had deep ties to Santa Cruz. Her maternal great grandparents </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">owned a pharmacy on Pacific Ave, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and their sons established a</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">successful local real estate business in 1906, so Howard Hoekenga visited Santa Cruz frequently. She was familiar with the little beach town&#8212; so when it was time for her to apply for colleges UC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Santa Cruz stuck out as one of her top picks.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Santa Cruz was my second home, really,&#8221; Howard Hoekenga said. &#8220;I heard about the campus, and it sounded really cool that there was going to be a UC campus in Santa Cruz. It was iffy whether or not the campus was going to open when I was ready to go right out of high school, but they did it. They opened UC Santa Cruz in &#8217;65, and the rest is history.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The art major had not yet been established when she was a first-year, but Howard Hoekenga was determined to pursue art. She took multiple art courses and majored in History with a minor in Art History. She contemplated transferring schools to pursue an art degree, but ultimately decided to stay at UCSC after falling in love with the campus, the university&#8217;s philosophy, and the people she met along the way.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a hard place to leave once you got your bearings,&#8221; Howard Hoekenga said. &#8220;I met some really fun, interesting people, and it really felt like a community. I knew that if I transferred &#8212;even to another UC campus &#8212;I&#8217;d have to start all over again, and it wouldn&#8217;t have that same community feeling.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howard Hoekenga said she was happy with her decision to stay and ended up taking courses with iconic professors like Page Smith, John Dizikes, Jasper Rose, and Beatrice Thompson who left an impact on her life and career path.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her third year, Howard Hoekenga and other painting students gathered their supplies and took a trip to the meadows at the West end of campus. Ansel Adams &#8212; who UC President Clark Kerr commissioned to document the new campus at the time &#8212; took photos of the painting students in their element.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams shot a photo of Howard Hoekenga that day. Over five decades later, Howard Hoekenga laid eyes on the photo of herself for the first time on </span><a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/first-decade/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC&#8217;s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after being announced the winner of the Alumni Survey giveaway.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As you scrolled down, there were all these familiar sites, and then all of a sudden that picture was there, and I&#8217;m thinking &#8216;that looks like the day we were out painting&#8217; and then I looked again and said &#8216;wait that&#8217;s me,&#8217;&#8221; Howard Hoekenga said. &#8220;That was the first time I really saw that photo, and I was doubly surprised to hear that it was actually in his collection.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1969 Howard Hoekenga graduated with the first-ever four-year graduating class from UCSC with a B.A. in History and a minor in Art History. She later went back to school at the University of Nevada Las Vegas to pursue a B.A. in Art and is now the Vice President of the Boulder City Art Guild based in Southern Nevada.&#160;</span></p>

Kira Gaber (Kresge, &#8217;06) is the winner of the second drawing for the getaway trip.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to our winners, and thank you to all that participated in the Alumni Survey.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently residing in San Francisco, UCSC alumna Kira Gaber </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Kresge &#8217;06, Business Management and Economics, History of Art in Visual Culture)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> looks back at her years at UC Santa Cruz fondly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After attending community college in San Francisco, Gaber transferred to UCSC and graduated with two B.A.'s in Business Management and Economics and History of Art in Visual Culture in 2006. She says late professor emeritus and former accounting department chair Bob Shepherd had a profound impact on her career path.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I felt like he was my greatest influence, and I feel like where I am today is because of his teaching style and encouragement,&#8221; Gaber says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shepherd had hosted a job fair for accounting firms and encouraged Gaber to attend. Through the job fair, Gaber found her first job with PricewaterhouseCoopers. After working with the company for about a year and a half, Gaber went on to work for an architecture design firm, a public relations agency, and is now working for a startup company in San Francisco, all with a focus on finance and accounting.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaber says her time at UC Santa Cruz allowed her to explore multiple interests while discovering her career path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz taught me to be open to everything and every opportunity,&#8221; Gaber says. &#8220;There were classes that I took that wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have been on my radar, and getting to take classes with other students that you wouldn't ordinarily see really kept your mind open.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaber says she is excited to use her alumni survey getaway package to take a vacation to Santa Cruz with two of her childhood friends who also attended UCSC. Gaber and her friends hope to visit the beaches, the redwood forests, and Pacific Avenue while in Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz coincidentally was the right choice for all of us,&#8221; Gaber says. &#8220;We are still super good friends, and we definitely spent a lot of time together. I didn't make a lot of new friends at UCSC, but was able to solidify my relationships with my closest friends.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio were a part of the first cohorts of students at UCSC, Lapsley and Nerton graduated in 1971 and Rose in 1972. Now five decades later, the self-named &#8220;Gang of Three&#8221; have spent countless hours planning events and raising funds for Crown College, becoming some of the most active members of&#160; the UCSC alumni community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through volunteering their time and talents with Crown College, the trio not only found a cause to give back to, but also developed a deep friendship with one another that will last them a lifetime.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It sounds so trivial, but it&#8217;s fun,&#8221; Nerton says. &#8220;And o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nce you have fun one time you just want to continue to see your friends. It's really great working with people that you thoroughly trust. We can work together and there's mutual trust and respect.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pioneer classes of UCSC were significantly smaller than the almost 20,000 students that attend the university today, leaving students with a strong, close-knit sense of community with each other and with the campus. Although Lapsley, Nerton and Rose weren&#8217;t close friends when they attended the university as students, they knew of each other as fellow students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t until 2017 during the 50th celebration of Crown College&#8217;s opening that the trio worked together for the first time. They found themselves among a group of alumni wanting to modernize the Crown Library as a study space for students, and worked together to raise over $75,000. After this celebration, this group has continued to work together to support Crown students as part of Crown Provost&#8217;s Advising Committee (CPAC).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I never saw it coming,&#8221; Rose says. &#8220;I didn't sign up for it at all. We have this joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that if you had asked people 50 years ago, &#8216;who do you think's gonna plan your 50th reunion?&#8217; It wouldn&#8217;t have been us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rose found herself roped into the role of an alumni volunteer much earlier than Lapsley and Nerton. In 2002, the year of Rose&#8217;s 30th reunion, she was contacted by a Crown College staffer looking for photographs of her college years. Rose had worked extensively with film photography while attending UCSC, and frequented the dark room that once resided in the basement of the Harvey House.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She contacted fellow student photographers and found herself sifting through several hundred photos from her college years. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus began my volunteer career as a custodian of an unofficial photographic record of six early years at Crown College,&#8221; Rose says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their main goals are to support current students, bolster alumni engagement, and elevate the campus they once walked as students themselves.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Things have changed, everything's very crowded, and the college system that we knew has gone away,&#8221; Lapsley says. &#8220;And at first, we were wanting to bring it back, but we realized we couldn&#8217;t because the conditions aren't the same. What we can do is help Manel with some discretionary funds to help create a supportive community that can help students succeed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These funds have allowed Crown to enhance academic advising and Core, to help our students adjust to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, and to launch two new service-learning programs in the areas of entrepreneurship and applied ethics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://crown50reunion.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown College&#8217;s 50th reunion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the classes of &#8216;68, &#8216;69, &#8216;70, &#8216;71, and &#8216;72 is the first of its kind. The trio hopes that in bringing the pioneer classes together they can inspire more alumni to rekindle their relationships with each other, their campus, and their community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One thing that I hope will result from the upcoming reunion is that not only will old friendships be rekindled, but that new friendships will be made&#8212;much as what has taken place between Su, Lisa and me,&#8221; Lapsley says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They&#8217;re hopeful that this year&#8217;s Crown College 50th reunion will set the foundation for reunions of its kind in the future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#8220;Gang of Three&#8221; is working to plan events familiar to pioneer alumni including folk dancing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an event that once took place every Friday at the Fieldhouse. Other events include guided bus tours of the UCSC campus, a Crown 50th reunion dinner, an Alumni brunch at the provost&#8217;s house, and more. The 50th reunion will be held from April 21-24 as part of </span><a href="https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><i>Lisa Rose, Jim Lapsley, and Su Nerton are just three of several alumni volunteers working together to plan Crown College&#8217;s 50th reunion. Marilyn Shea-Stonum, Henry Chu, Roger Peters, Bill Allayaud, and Jennifer D comprise a core group of alumni planners and volunteers.&#160;</i></p>

<p>This is why when he&#8217;s not in the classroom, Hess will sometimes find himself chest deep in water in a flooded farm basin or hunched over a sediment analyzer in the hydrogeology lab of UC Santa Cruz Earth and Planetary Sciences Professor Andy Fisher, part of an effort to find tools to help recharge California&#8217;s threatened aquifers as water crises loom.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s valuable work,&#8221; said the junior college transfer student who has won several scholarships and been helped on his way by two programs on campus. &#8220;It&#8217;s contributing to a current issue affecting the short-term and long-term future of water in California.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking by phone from the Earth and Marine Sciences building on campus, Hess described wading into infiltration ponds to take samples and working in the lab doing grain-size analysis of soil from sites near the Cosumnes River and in the Pajaro Valley. The data he is collecting and analyzing will help researchers determine the infiltration potential of varying soil types and estimate how much surface water will go into underground aquifers to recharge them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal is to increase vertical infiltration into the aquifer rather than water traveling laterally and stagnating,&#8221; Hess said.&#160;</p>
<p>Hess said he has found community at UC Santa Cruz not only in his department but also through two programs: Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students (STARS) and Workshops for Engineering and Science Transfers (WEST).</p>
<p>STARS, he said, &#8220;did a great job of making me aware of everything that was available on campus as far as where things were and which programs offered specific services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Likewise, the intense two-and-a-half-day WEST program helped jump-start his UC Santa Cruz career by bringing together students of different educational backgrounds and introducing them to the pace of study and to research opportunities while also building connections and confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was invaluable help,&#8221; Hess said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hess&#8217;s passion for his work led to his being awarded the Silvia Miller Scholarship for re-entry students and also the prestigious Kathryn D. Sullivan scholarship designed to encourage undergraduate research&#8212;$10,000 in all&#8212;which allowed him to continue his academic and research efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Andy [Fisher] said it this way,&#8221; Hess said. &#8220;Everyone has their time when they are going to accomplish certain things they want to do, and I think now is the time for me.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b8a44c248072704664be42b44db1786d"><name>news-article</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Dorothy R.

Santos has so many achievements they&#8217;re almost too many to count, according to the graduate programs coordinator in the UC Santa Cruz Film and Digital Media Department.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Santos, a doctoral candidate in film and digital media, received the department&#8217;s 2020&#8211;21 Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award and is one of the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts 100 in 2021 for &#8220;extraordinary commitment to building sustainable, equitable, and regenerative communities.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>She cofounded the collaborative and politically engaged arts platform REFRESH and is the executive director of <a class="" href="https://processingfoundation.org/">Processing Foundation</a>, a nonprofit committed to the visual arts, software literacy, accessibility, and inclusion. She is currently a lecturer at San Jose State University in the Digital Media Art program.&#160;</p>
<p>Santos is a recipient of the Eugene V. Cota-Robles Fellowship, which pays her tuition and provides her with a stipend for her doctoral studies.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am eternally grateful for that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I would not have pursued graduate work if not for that fellowship.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;Born and raised in San Francisco&#8217;s Mission District in a Filipino immigrant family, Santos, 42, has always looked at life through a global, transnational lens. Santos was very nearly born in the Philippines, as her mother moved to the U.S. when she was eight months pregnant with her.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;Though her parents didn&#8217;t teach her to speak Tagalog, she learned to understand it along with learning and speaking English. When she was 4, she learned Spanish from the family&#8217;s next-door neighbor she lovingly called Mama Miriam.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Santos received her master&#8217;s degree in visual and critical studies from the California College of the Arts and earned bachelor&#8217;s degrees in philosophy and psychology from the University of San Francisco. She also spent 14 years working in biotech.</p>
<p>Now, at UC Santa Cruz, she studies the way the human voice is trained and mediated as part of her research in feminist media histories, critical medical anthropology, tech, race, and ethics.&#160;</p>
<p>She finds it fascinating how certain types of Western and Eurocentric accents are considered authoritative. For example, she researched the desegregation of Bell System telephone operators in the 1960s and '70s and how Black women from the South suffered from racial discrimination&#160; due to their accents and socioeconomic status, she said.&#160;</p>
<p>She recalls her mother trying to tone down her Filipino accent when she and her mother once worked for the same company.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;It hurt and frustrated me,&#8221; she said.&#160;</p>
<p>Santos&#8217;s dissertation focuses on voice recognition and assistive technologies. She hopes to look at how the technology might be made more accessible and inclusive in the future.&#160;</p>
<p>Santos is also creating an artwork that responds to her research. It will include a limited-edition book tentatively titled, <em>Do No Harm,</em> that subverts scientific documentation and uses the format of a choose-your-own adventure game. People who purchase the book will have an option to become a part of a durational participatory work.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not collecting data for surveillance purposes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s part performance piece. Participants are free to see where it takes them in the end.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>She has appreciated the opportunities offered her at UC Santa Cruz, including becoming a graduate fellow for the Science &amp; Justice Research Center. She participated in a research cluster called Theorizing Race After Race. Her work with the group examined how statistical modeling was done during the pandemic and how data from the media compared with data put out by other institutions. She worked with Professor Jaime Morse in Sociology and undergraduate fellow Aitanna Parker (Stevenson '20, critical race and ethnic studies; technology and information management) on this research, which resulted in a dialogue with journalist Alexis Madrigal, a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em> and a cofounder of The COVID Tracking Project.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten that opportunity anywhere else,&#8221; Santos said, adding it was great to work alongside social scientists and sociologists.&#160;</p>
<p>After earning her doctoral degree, she would like to continue teaching, working with Processing Foundation, and advocating for artists and open-source software communities.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m open to opportunities that might come my way,&#8221; she said.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b8ac1bae8072704664be42b4256719e1"><name>jonathan-green</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Jonathan Green: The value of mentorship</title><start-date>1648494000000</start-date><display-name>jonathan-green</display-name><path>/2022/03/jonathan-green</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/jonathan-green</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1648070761371</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648070761371</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/jonathangreenlead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/jonathangreenlead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jonathangreenlead.jpg</name><display-name>jonathangreenlead.jpg</display-name><file-size>61630</file-size><width>450</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/jonathangreenthumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/jonathangreenthumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jonathangreenthumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>jonathangreenthumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>19877</file-size><width>80</width><height>53</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>Jonathan Green recalls a memorable day in high school in Santa Monica when he got to tour a biotech lab.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>He loved seeing the microscopes, the high-tech science equipment, and the scientists at work. He knew this would be a field he would enjoy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Now a senior at UC Santa Cruz, Green (Rachel Carson '22) is enjoying studying molecular, cell and developmental biology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Green first got interested in science as a child reading about anatomy. He was also inspired by his older sister, who always got good grades and attended community college.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>His focus on science has a personal component because his aunt has Huntington&#8217;s disease, a genetic condition that causes nerve cells in the brain to break down over time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen her decay and I wanted to learn about biology,&#8221; Green said.</span></p>
<p><span>Green is the first person in his family to attend a four-year university and credits the SEMILLA Scholars Peer Mentorship Program with giving him tremendous support his first year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I would have faced a lot more challenges&#8221; without the program, Green said. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t know the people I know now and I probably would have done academically worse to a degree.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>SEMILLA supports underrepresented students, including Hispanics like Green, in their goals to earn a degree in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. Green was in the program&#8217;s first cohort and was assigned a peer mentor who helped him navigate the unfamiliar university system.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;That really helped me,&#8221; Green said. &#8220;It let me feel connected.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>He was also required to attend regular meetings with counselors and enroll in supplemental Academic Excellence (ACE) classes that assisted him in studying for his STEM classes. A typical ACE class might be a 30-person session that breaks down a 200-person lecture class, which could be overwhelming to the new student.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;ACE is a blessing,&#8221; Green said. &#8220;Everyone should do it.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Green appreciated his experience with SEMILLA so much that he became a mentor the following year and each subsequent year. He said the support offered by the program is crucial to incoming freshmen.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;People get overwhelmed, especially in STEM because it is very demanding,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>SEMILLA also gave him the skills to navigate the undergraduate research world, where he applied and was accepted into the Center to Advance Mentored Inquiry-Based Opportunities (CAMINO), a program that aims to support undergraduates in ecology and conservation. Placed in Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Erika Zavaleta&#8217;s lab, he briefly conducted research in the alpine environment along the Sierra Nevada range, studying how climate change affects species that live in the alpine environment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>In his third year, Green also received support from UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s STEM Diversity programs as a Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) fellow, which supports underrepresented students in science studies with the goal of applying to graduate school. Since fall 2020, he has worked in MCD Biology Associate Professor Zhu Wang&#8217;s lab handling mice and researching the AR and Wnt signaling pathways in the prostate gland.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, he has received valuable guidance in how to interact in the science world&#8212;from the language to use, to the way to build a r&#233;sum&#233;, to the steps to pursue graduate studies and beyond.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>He is happy SEMILLA reached out to him and invited him to apply for the program before he started attending classes at UC Santa Cruz. He has seen over his college career how many people who start out with STEM majors eventually drop out and switch to something else.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;It&#8217;s so easy to get lost,&#8221; he said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b8b0ade48072704664be42b422f035f7"><name>pearl-ibeanusi</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Pearl Ibeanusi: Finding her village—and elevating her community</title><start-date>1648494000000</start-date><display-name>pearl-ibeanusi</display-name><path>/2022/03/pearl-ibeanusi</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/pearl-ibeanusi</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1648071060945</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648071060945</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>ptownsend@cruzio.com</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/pearlibeanusilead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/pearlibeanusilead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pearlibeanusilead.jpg</name><display-name>pearlibeanusilead.jpg</display-name><file-size>110311</file-size><width>450</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/pearlibeanusithumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/pearlibeanusithumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pearlibeanusithumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>pearlibeanusithumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>21287</file-size><width>80</width><height>53</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Every morning, Pearl Ibeanusi would wake up at 4 a.m., hoist a pan of plantains onto her head, and walk the streets of her rural village in Nigeria calling, &#8220;Buy plantains for breakfast,&#8221; until all her wares were gone. She was 8 years old.&#160;</p>
<p>Afterward, Ibeanusi would get her five siblings ready for school, go to her own class, pick up her brothers when school let out, feed them, make a lunch to take to her mother&#8217;s vegetable stall and help her mother sell produce, clean up, and then go home to help make dinner. It was what was expected of the oldest girl in the family.</p>
<p>Ibeanusi, who everyone in her village called <em>Obere,</em> or &#8220;little girl,&#8221; longed for more, however. She wanted an education. She wanted a good job.&#160;</p>
<p>Today, the little market girl is a senior at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Stevenson College with a double major in community studies and in education, democracy, and justice; a 3.9 GPA; a student ambassadorship to UC&#8217;s systemwide Global Health Initiative; and an internship with the Office of Emergency Service in San Jose.</p>
<p>It took Ibeanusi&#8217;s determination and perseverance to get her where she is today, but, according to her, it also took scholarships, mentorships, and support from faculty and staff to help the mother of six find success.&#160;</p>
<p>Ibeanusi came to the United States in 1992 hoping to continue her education and find a good job. She&#8217;d excelled at school in Nigeria&#8212;her family and community had cheered her on&#8212;but with a young daughter in tow, she found it was harder here.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was on my own,&#8221; Ibeanusi said by telephone. &#8220;There was no one to help me. In Nigeria, it takes a village to raise a child, and, if I was there, I would have had one. But here there was no one to take care of my child and I couldn&#8217;t afford day care.&#8221;</p>
<p>She enrolled in junior college and tried bringing her 3-year-old to class, but the professor refused to let the child stay, Ibeanusi said. In desperation, she set up her toddler in the hallway with a blanket, food, and toys, but when the little girl came into class and said she needed to use the bathroom, Ibeanusi was told she needed to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I left crying, thinking that was the end of the world for me,&#8221; Ibeanusi said. &#8220;My dream had been squashed.&#8221;</p>
<p>She got a series of minimum-wage jobs and suffered a bout with thyroid cancer. Eventually, however, Ibeanusi found her village: mentors at South San Francisco Adult School who helped her enroll in Skyline College, where she found another network of support. There, she earned a 4.0 GPA and became president of the Associated Students of Skyline College.&#160;</p>
<p>Ibeanusi chose UC Santa Cruz not only because it offered the community studies major, which fit her goal of finding a leadership position where she could make a difference in the world, but also because, she said, she found critical support and mentors in Mary Beth Pudup, associate professor and director of the community studies program, and Sarah Arantza Amador, administrative manager in the Humanities Division.&#160;</p>
<p>She also won two scholarships.</p>
<p>In 2020, Ibeanusi was awarded the prestigious Karl S. Pister scholarship, which provided $20,000 in funding over two years and is given to only 13 students nationwide, and, in 2021 she won the $4,000 Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship, which is awarded to social science students who are committed to public service.</p>
<p>The scholarships, Ibeanusi said, were important as a way &#8220;to help me spread my wings at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now completing an unpaid internship with the San Jose Emergency Service Office in the housing division, Ibeanusi said she is hoping to find other scholarships to help her meet her goal of earning a master&#8217;s and doctorate since she cannot afford the cost on her own.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be in a position of leadership to help make a difference,&#8221; she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b8b3bd8a8072704664be42b4eb21c01c"><name>jazmine-miles</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Jazmine Miles: Hands on research brings learning full circle</title><start-date>1648494000000</start-date><display-name>jazmine-miles</display-name><path>/2022/03/jazmine-miles</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/jazmine-miles</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1648071261559</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648071261559</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>ptownsend@cruzio.com</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/jazmine.miles.lead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/jazmine.miles.lead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jazmine.miles.lead.jpg</name><display-name>jazmine.miles.lead.jpg</display-name><file-size>51413</file-size><width>450</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/jazmine.miles.thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/jazmine.miles.thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jazmine.miles.thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>jazmine.miles.thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>16992</file-size><width>80</width><height>53</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Jazmine Miles came to UC Santa Cruz looking for a place to grow.</p>
<p>Today, thanks to an unexpected class choice, an inspiring sociology professor, and an opportunity to do hands-on research about the growing youth power movement in a once-conservative corner of California, the senior sociology major and film minor at Merrill College has done just that.</p>
<p>Miles, 21, said she came to the forested campus expecting to major in biology. Normally an excellent student, she found herself struggling with college life and her rigorous classes. A Merrill College counselor suggested an introduction to sociology course taught by Professor Christy McCullen.</p>
<p>&#8220;It [the class] was the first time I learned how systems of oppression had affected me and people who look like me,&#8221; said Miles, who is African American. &#8220;I was always aware I had different experiences because of my race and gender but this [course] opened a new door and made me passionate about wanting to learn and grow in a topic I was truly interested in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Offered a research opportunity by former UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professor of Sociology Veronica Terriquez to explore youth movements in the rapidly changing Inland Empire (Riverside and San Bernardino counties), Miles eventually decided to accept. Terriquez is now a professor and director of the Chicano Studies Research Center at UCLA.</p>
<p>Gathering statistics and doing interviews while the pandemic kept her at home, Miles said she discovered a world of young, dedicated activists working to better their community&#8212;something that had flown under her radar even though she&#8217;d grown up in the area.</p>
<p>The 2020 report, <em>Emerging Youth Power in the Inland Empire</em>, was published on the Dornsife Equity Research Institute website and also appeared on UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Institute for Social Transformation website. It highlighted work youth did in the area to get out the vote during the presidential election.&#160;</p>
<p>Doing hands-on research, Miles said, helped make the lessons she learned in the classroom come alive.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was able to see the way in which communities are being impacted by the social structures in place,&#8221; said Miles from her home in Murrieta, California.&#160;</p>
<p>At work on another research project exploring the effects of social media on young women, Miles said these hands-on learning experiences have helped her find a passion &#8220;for something I truly love doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hopes to get a master&#8217;s degree and doctorate on her way to becoming a documentary-style filmmaker in the manner of Oscar winner Chloe Zhao, whose 2020 film <em>Nomadland</em> won Best Picture, making her the first woman of color to win the category.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see myself researching the new social dynamics that are emerging and the ones that are beginning to diminish,&#8221; Miles said of the kind of films she wants to make. &#8220;So many social structures are settling in and old ones are falling away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting how important it is to have history recorded and reported by a diversity of voices, she said, &#8220;There is so much taking place at the moment and someone has to document it.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b8bb27278072704664be42b42d7b9f0d"><name>cassandra-marr</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Cassandra Mar: Bringing the power to the people</title><start-date>1648494000000</start-date><display-name>cassandra-marr</display-name><path>/2022/03/cassandra-marr</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/cassandra-marr</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1648071747347</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648071787404</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/cassandralead2.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/cassandralead2.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cassandralead2.jpg</name><display-name>cassandralead2.jpg</display-name><file-size>231385</file-size><width>450</width><height>311</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/cassandra.marr.thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/cassandra.marr.thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cassandra.marr.thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>cassandra.marr.thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>16120</file-size><width>80</width><height>41</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Cassandra Mar has a passion for helping ordinary people, especially minorities, feel connected to the political process.&#160;</p>
<p>As a recent graduate of UC Santa Cruz in politics (highest honors) and legal studies (honors), she hopes to inspire more people to make their voices heard in the political arena.&#160;</p>
<p>Growing up in Sacramento as a Mexican-American daughter of immigrants, Mar witnessed a growing mistrust of government within her community. Many family members and friends didn&#8217;t vote, with there being a general consensus that you didn&#8217;t talk about politics because you wanted to keep conversations friendly.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a lack of trust and understanding,&#8221; she said, adding that the people she spoke to often wondered, &#8220;What does the government do, what can it do for me, and where do I fit in this process?&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>As she pursued her college studies and began to find the answers to these questions, she eagerly shared what she had learned with others.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Politics is a very intricate process, and it&#8217;s purposefully made to be confusing and meant to exclude a lot of people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was convinced that we [as a community] need to further our knowledge of the political process and remind ourselves that we hold the power, with our representatives working for us. We don&#8217;t wait for someone to give us a turn, instead we take it ourselves.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>She was grateful to become a <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/funding/building-belonging/">UCSC Building Belonging</a> Fellow, which gave her the chance to work with Santa Cruz County Supervisor and politics lecturer Ryan Coonerty on studying the lasting effects of hate speech on democracy. Coonerty has become a mentor to her, encouraging her to back up her opinions on political issues with facts, while simultaneously teaching her about the importance of local politics, where Coonerty says &#8220;democracy goes to live.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Mar took advantage of other opportunities to increase her knowledge by gaining internships in various law firms, including working at the Watsonville Law Center to host free immigration law clinics. She also interned in Assemblymember Kevin McCarty&#8217;s office in her hometown of Sacramento.&#160;</p>
<p>Her next step will be to start working at the California State Capitol as an Assembly Fellow in October. She was one of 18 people chosen from some 1,500 applicants for the paid 11-month position. Here she will work as a legislative aide helping to shape public policy.&#160;</p>
<p>She applied to both the Assembly and Senate fellowship programs, ultimately accepting a position in the Assembly because, she says, it's the people&#8217;s house, where members are more responsive to their constituents.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Mar knows that it is a difficult time to be in politics with so much polarization. However, the key for her has been to stay open-minded with a willingness to learn. She believes that everybody should be willing to have a conversation with those who see things differently than they do, as &#8220;good speech serves to counter bad speech.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the most part, if you approach people with respect and a desire to understand them and their point of view, people tend to be receptive,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All people want is to be heard and acknowledged.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b8c538e18072704664be42b4efc5cf62"><name>neil-hardy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Neil Hardy: Generational health</title><start-date>1648494000000</start-date><display-name>neil-hardy</display-name><path>/2022/03/neil-hardy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/neil-hardy</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1648072407245</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648072407245</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/neil.hardy.lead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/neil.hardy.lead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>neil.hardy.lead.jpg</name><display-name>neil.hardy.lead.jpg</display-name><file-size>106987</file-size><width>450</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/neil.hardy.thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/neil.hardy.thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>neil.hardy.thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>neil.hardy.thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>21229</file-size><width>80</width><height>53</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Neil Hardy won&#8217;t likely stay in academia when he finishes his doctoral degree in electrical and computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz in the next couple of years.&#160;</p>
<p>He would like to be an inventor or an entrepreneur in the health care technology sector.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to help people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to improve the health span of people for generations.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Hardy is developing state-of-the-art brain-machine interface technologies that could eventually help people with neurodegenerative and neuropathic diseases such as Parkinson&#8217;s, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, or dementia. He is developing biosensors for neurons that scientists can use to see many more neurons than they would otherwise be able to see. The technology provides &#8220;a level of detail not available with any other technology,&#8221; he explained.&#160;</p>
<p>Hardy&#8217;s research is not published yet, but he has shown the technology can be used with heart cells, which are a stepping stone to experimenting with neurons. He hopes that with time and more development the technology could eventually find its way to health clinics, which would be the real goal.</p>
<p>Originally from Birmingham, Ala., Hardy has been interested in science since he was a child. When he was only in 8<sup>th</sup>grade, he was conducting his own experiments to test the Mpemba effect, which demonstrates that hot water can freeze faster than cold water. Science runs in Hardy&#8217;s family&#8212;his father is a pathologist and clinical chemist who teaches organic chemistry to dentistry and medical students, and his mother is a pharmacist.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was very obsessed with physics for a long time,&#8221; Hardy said. &#8220;When I got to undergrad, I double majored in physics and electrical engineering.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Hardy started his doctoral degree at UC Santa Cruz in physics in 2017 and switched to electrical and computer engineering in 2019. He is grateful for the $10,000 scholarship he got from Achievement Rewards for College Students (ARCS) as well as other awards from the Chancellor Fellowship, which pays all university fees for incoming doctoral students in any discipline.&#160;</p>
<p>Hardy chose to make the cross-country move to come to UC Santa Cruz because he wanted to work in neuroscience and neurotechnologies and was impressed with what the university had to offer.&#160;</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the benefit of being close to Silicon Valley. He was able to listen to a panel discussion at UC Santa Cruz featuring graduates who became entrepreneurs.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I liked that I got to get their feedback on what they saw the challenges were in being an entrepreneur specifically out of Santa Cruz,&#8221; Hardy said.</p>
<p>Ideally, he would like to begin his own startup right in Santa Cruz.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of bright ideas coming out of Santa Cruz,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What&#8217;s stopping getting them out is funding.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>It takes an enormous amount of capital to start the kind of high-tech businesses he and others are after.&#160;</p>
<p>Hardy is working on talking to investors and figuring out what he can do to stay in the natural beauty of Santa Cruz.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love it here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I get to surf; I get to rock climb. The people just get me.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b8d1fbeb8072704664be42b43eb57ed6"><name>meleia-simon-reynolds</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Meleia Simon-Reynolds: Documenting the local Filipino-American experience</title><start-date>1648494000000</start-date><display-name>meleia-simon-reynolds</display-name><path>/2022/03/meleia-simon-reynolds</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/meleia-simon-reynolds</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1648073243607</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648073243607</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/meleiasreynoldslead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/meleiasreynoldslead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>meleiasreynoldslead.jpg</name><display-name>meleiasreynoldslead.jpg</display-name><file-size>180566</file-size><width>450</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/meleiasreynoldsthumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/meleiasreynoldsthumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>meleiasreynoldsthumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>meleiasreynoldsthumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>25871</file-size><width>80</width><height>53</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As a child, Meleia Simon-Reynolds spent much of her time at her Filipino grandmother&#8217;s house, but she never heard much about her life.&#160;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until much later when the UC Santa Cruz history doctoral student was assigned to interview an immigrant for a class that she heard her grandmother&#8217;s experiences for the first time.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I learned so much about my family that I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Simon-Reynolds, who identifies as mixed race of white and Filipino.&#160;</p>
<p>Now she and other students are helping preserve local Filipino-American history by creating an oral history digital archive for the community organization Watsonville is in the Heart.&#160;</p>
<p>The work is funded by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s The Humanities Institute. She and others are contacting Filipinos in the Watsonville area and asking about their family migration stories. The goal is to make the information available for the wider public, particularly teachers who are being asked to include ethnic studies in their classrooms.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope local teachers can use it to teach in their communities about the Filipino-American experience,&#8221; she said.&#160;</p>
<p>In her interview with her grandmother, Simon-Reynolds learned that her family had a long history of people going to the United States for their university education and then coming home. Simon-Reynolds&#8217;s grandmother came to the U.S. in the 1950s to attend college but then ended up staying. Her grandmother showed her photo albums and scrapbooks that documented her experiences.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw those before,&#8221; Simon-Reynolds said.&#160;</p>
<p>She is similarly seeing a lot of photo albums and scrapbooks from people involved with the Watsonville in the Heart Project. She said the community really appreciates having people show an interest in their stories.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;People are super excited to talk to us and really excited to have us digitize their family documents and photographs,&#8221; said Simon-Reynolds, who is managing a team of undergrad students to work on the archive.&#160;</p>
<p>The project covers a diverse array of topics: male laborers and race riots; women and children; mixed-race families; and community celebrations. Everything is driven by the community.&#160;</p>
<p>Born in Santa Cruz, Simon-Reynolds lived in the area until she was about 6 or 7. She and her family then moved to Orange County, where her grandmother lived, and they would return from time to time to visit Santa Cruz.&#160;</p>
<p>Simon-Reynolds earned her bachelor&#8217;s degree in history from UC Irvine before heading to UC Santa Cruz to pursue her master&#8217;s degree.&#160;</p>
<p>She said she wanted to come to Santa Cruz because she likes the area and because of professors like Alice Yang, who uses oral history to study the experiences of immigrants from Asia and the Pacific islands.&#160;</p>
<p>Simon-Reynolds&#8217;s dissertation is about Filipinx migration to the Pajaro Valley area and Hawaii from the 1920s to the present.&#160;</p>
<p>She is grateful for the financial support she has received, including a UC Regents Fellowship and assistance from the Social Sciences Research Center Dissertation Proposal Development program.&#160;</p>
<p>Simon-Reynolds also received a fellowship at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning to learn about equitable and inclusive teaching strategies. Among the things she learned were to incorporate more small group activities than lectures and to give students more agency over their learning experience.&#160;</p>
<p>Simon-Reynolds said she is happy for the chance to give back to the larger community through her work on the digital archive for Watsonville is in the Heart. One of the best parts is that members of the local Filipino community are driving the project, she said.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The university is giving its expertise and support to make their dreams and wishes come true,&#8221; Simon-Reynolds said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b8fb49df8072704664be42b4c5d047e3"><name>chance-brown</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Discovery in McHenry Library Inspires First-Generation Alumnus to Become a Champion of Social Change</title><start-date>1648494000000</start-date><display-name>chance-brown</display-name><path>/2022/03/chance-brown</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/chance-brown</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1648075950538</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648076137996</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Paula Hermann</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/chancebrownlead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/chancebrownlead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chancebrownlead.jpg</name><display-name>chancebrownlead.jpg</display-name><file-size>78216</file-size><width>300</width><height>432</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/chancebrownthumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/chancebrownthumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chancebrownthumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>chancebrownthumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>18130</file-size><width>65</width><height>94</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>When Chance Brown (Merrill &#8217;89, sociology) arrived at UCSC in 1985, he was embarking on a solo mission that was unfamiliar and overwhelming. The first in his family to pursue a college degree, Brown relied on the staff in the Educational Opportunity Programs (EOP) office to help him navigate the complexities of college life and the academic rigor of a selective college.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only knew what I knew; having a strong work ethic wasn&#8217;t enough. I needed people to support and encourage me,&#8221; said Brown who was overjoyed when he learned about the university&#8217;s new Student Success Initiative, launched this fall. &#8220;The university values first-generation students, and this is a powerful way to put those values into action.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Student Success Initiative is a five-year philanthropic campaign aimed at increasing financial support, creating programs to navigate university life and cultivating experiences that will give all students an equitable opportunity to achieve success and experience social mobility.</p>
<p>&#8220;First-generation students don&#8217;t have any context of the college experience, and I know first-hand how important support systems are for success,&#8221; he said. &#8220;College is an extraordinary opportunity. Your degree is the foundation of your career, and it will follow you and open doors throughout your life.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Brown says his time at UC Santa Cruz was transformative, and he attributes his ability to graduate in four years, with honors, to the people who supported and encouraged him along the way. One of the most memorable to him was sociology professor, John Brown Childs, currently a Professor Emeritus, who was instrumental in empowering Brown to reach his full potential.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I got to UCSC, Black students accounted for about three percent of the population, and they had a 10 percent graduation rate in four years. Those statistics were not in my favor, but professor Childs, through his example, inspired me to create new statistics. He taught me to believe in myself, and he helped me become a better man.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Brown dedicated himself to his coursework, spending hours in McHenry Library. It was there, in the E185 section of the third-floor collections, where he discovered a gateway to history that influenced his life in formidable ways, both personally and professionally.&#160;</p>
<p>E185 is the universal library section, designated by the Library of Congress, for books on African American history.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like an entire world opened up. All of this history that I hadn&#8217;t learned in high school was right there. As soon as I finished my coursework, I would head to that section and create my own Black History syllabus. I read about Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Supreme Court Justice, W.E.B. Du Bois, the first Black man to receive a Ph.D. at Harvard, and Alain Locke, the first African American Rhodes Scholar. I realized there were some Black scholars who made tremendous contributions to this country. Their success gave me a sense of agency. It inspired me to achieve high grades and graduate in four years. I was going to be part of a legacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown&#8217;s insatiable desire to absorb as much as he could about Black heritage motivated him to excel in the classroom, and his tenacity paid off. He received the College Service Award from Merrill College at graduation and went on to earn a Master of Science from the Milano School of Policy, Management and Environment at The New School, as well as a Management Policy Certificate from Harvard.&#160;</p>
<p>He has dedicated his career to transforming communities, empowering economic mobility and enabling people through education. Brown worked for the Ford Foundation and the National Urban League, garnering a national reputation as a social-change advocate, which earned him a spot on the 30 under 30 Future Leaders list in Ebony magazine.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>He has served in roles for 100 Black Men of Greater Charlotte, NC, and as a board member for Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) Charlotte, that offers free college preparatory schooling for high school students in underserved communities. He is a founding member of The Gentlemen&#8217;s Factory, which promotes economic empowerment for men and women leaders from underrepresented populations.&#160;</p>
<p>Brown has excelled as a human resource professional, currently serving as director, talent development and D&amp;I at SPX Corporation, a global supplier of highly engineered HVAC and Detection &amp; Measurement products and technologies with 4,000 people in 15 countries. He leads Diversity and Inclusion, leadership development and management programs, and trains employees on online learning platforms.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Education is a transformative tool. My education at UCSC changed my life. I&#8217;m honored to be working on projects that enable people to develop their skills, giving them knowledge that enables them to do their jobs more effectively and expand what they know. Through education, we can enrich the lives of people who can make companies better and improve society. It&#8217;s a way of paying forward the power of education.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b8fd62878072704664be42b436c5e872"><name>babak-farahmand</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Babak Farahmand: Navigating complex systems</title><start-date>1648494000000</start-date><display-name>babak-farahmand</display-name><path>/2022/03/babak-farahmand</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/babak-farahmand</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1648076087922</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648076115515</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Haneen Zain</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/babak.lead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/babak.lead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>babak.lead.jpg</name><display-name>babak.lead.jpg</display-name><file-size>36962</file-size><width>450</width><height>272</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/babak.thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/babak.thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>babak.thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>babak.thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>11981</file-size><width>80</width><height>48</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Babak Farahmand <em>(John R. Lewis &#8217;20, Computer Science)</em> came to the U.S. as a refugee from Iran six years ago without any money, connections, or understanding of the English language, but managed to graduate debt-free.</p>
<p>Farahmand was determined to pursue higher education, transferring to UC Santa Cruz from Berkeley City College in 2018. Although this was a huge accomplishment, he struggled to find the right support along the way, and was unfamiliar with the university system. A fierce optimist, he was dogged in finding resources.</p>
<p>When he first arrived at UCSC, he didn&#8217;t know who to turn to for help in navigating the campus. Without a support network, he says he didn&#8217;t even know what questions to ask. He also felt immense pressure to graduate from UCSC in two years or less&#8212;taking longer wasn&#8217;t financially feasible since he had to work full time to support himself.</p>
<p>Then he found the Services for Transfers and Re-entry Students (STARS) office, where staff explained STARS&#8217; services and showed Farahmand how to apply for a campus job.&#160;</p>
<p>For the rest of his time at UCSC, Farahmand held several on and off-campus jobs, including developing the website for the Genomics Institute, working on DEI initiatives in Baskin Engineering, and working at a construction company in Capitola. All the while, Farahmand managed his own small consulting business DamianoDesigns, which he founded in 2016.</p>
<p>Eventually he became fluent enough in the system to access financial aid, but was only able to utilize it for a small portion of his tuition. Farahmand graduated from UC Santa Cruz debt-free predominantly through his own efforts to support himself.</p>
<p>Farahmand wasn&#8217;t shy about asking for resources, but his other obligations limited his ability to access them. As a full-time student working full-time hours, Farahmand says he missed out on multiple opportunities to advance his career in Computer Science. He could not attend career fairs, join clubs and organizations, and he struggled to find a community and build relationships.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I missed out on internships since paid internships were the only options; I had to have an income,&#8221; Farahmand said. &#8220;Personal networks play a huge role in getting those internships&#8212; networks I didn&#8217;t have access to.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said this resulted in a lot of stress since he didn&#8217;t have time or access to networks to help him find a post-college job.</p>
<p>Approaching graduation, he applied &#8220;to a lot of companies, hoping to get his foot in the door anywhere in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reduced my personal footprint to two suitcases so I could fly at a moment&#8217;s notice to any location,&#8221; Farahmand said.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>He took the very first job he was offered as a Solutions Architect. In this position, Farahmand learned what he loves doing most: Blending his technical knowledge with his people skills. Eventually, he decided to leave the job as he was averaging 12-hour work days including weekends.</p>
<p>Now living in Oakland, Farahmand&#8217;s goal is to work as a sales engineer where he can utilize his technical, social, and problem-solving skills hand-in-hand.&#160;</p>
<p>Farahmand is proud of his resiliency and education that have provided him the opportunity to travel so far in the last six years&#8212;and are ushering him into his future.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bca6bbd18072704664be42b4910f51a3"><name>methane-biosignatures</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Methane could be the first detectable indication of life beyond Earth</title><summary>A new study assesses the planetary context in which the detection of methane in an exoplanet’s atmosphere could be considered a compelling sign of life.</summary><keywords>Maggie Thompson, Joshua Krissansen-Totton</keywords><start-date>1648494000000</start-date><display-name>Methane could be the first detectable indication of life beyond Earth</display-name><path>/2022/03/methane-biosignatures</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/methane-biosignatures</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1648137518014</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648739191178</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/images/abiotic-methane-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/images/abiotic-methane-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>abiotic-methane-500.jpg</name><display-name>abiotic-methane-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>2877544</file-size><width>3300</width><height>3529</height></image><image-alt>abiotic sources of methane</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/images/abiotic-methane-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/images/abiotic-methane-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>abiotic-methane-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>abiotic-methane-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19790</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>volcano illustration</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Methane in a planet&#8217;s atmosphere may be a sign of life if nonbiological sources can be ruled out.

Although nonbiological processes can generate methane, a new study by scientists at UC Santa Cruz establishes a set of circumstances in which a persuasive case could be made for biological activity as the source of methane in a rocky planet&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy because methane is one of the few potential signs of life, or &#8220;biosignatures,&#8221; that could be readily detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope, which will begin observations later this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oxygen is often talked about as one of the best biosignatures, but it&#8217;s probably going to be hard to detect with JWST,&#8221; said Maggie Thompson, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and lead author of the new study.</p>
<p>Despite some prior studies on methane biosignatures, there had not been an up-to-date, dedicated assessment of the planetary conditions needed for methane to be a good biosignature. &#8220;We wanted to provide a framework for interpreting observations, so if we see a rocky planet with methane, we know what other observations are needed for it to be a persuasive biosignature,&#8221; Thompson said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2117933119">Published the week of March 28 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, the study examines a variety of non-biological sources of methane and assesses their potential to maintain a methane-rich atmosphere. These include volcanoes; reactions in settings such as mid-ocean ridges, hydrothermal vents, and tectonic subduction zones; and comet or asteroid impacts.</p>
<p>The case for methane as a biosignature stems from its instability in the atmosphere. Because photochemical reactions destroy atmospheric methane, it must be steadily replenished to maintain high levels.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you detect a lot of methane on a rocky planet, you typically need a massive source to explain that,&#8221; said coauthor Joshua Krissansen-Totton, a Sagan Fellow at UCSC. &#8220;We know biological activity creates large amounts of methane on Earth, and probably did on the early Earth as well because making methane is a fairly easy thing to do metabolically.</p>
<p>Nonbiological sources, however, would not be able to produce that much methane without also generating observable clues to its origins. Outgassing from volcanoes, for example, would add both methane and carbon monoxide to the atmosphere, while biological activity tends to readily consume carbon monoxide. The researchers found that nonbiological processes cannot easily produce habitable planet atmospheres rich in both methane and carbon dioxide and with little to no carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>The study emphasizes the need to consider the full planetary context in evaluating potential biosignatures. The researchers concluded that, for a rocky planet orbiting a sun-like star, atmospheric methane is more likely to be considered a strong indication of life if the atmosphere also has carbon dioxide, methane is more abundant than carbon monoxide, and extremely water-rich planetary compositions can be ruled out.</p>
<p>&#8220;One molecule is not going to give you the answer&#8212;you have to take into account the planet&#8217;s full context,&#8221; Thompson said. &#8220;Methane is one piece of the puzzle, but to determine if there is life on a planet you have to consider its geochemistry, how it&#8217;s interacting with its star, and the many processes that can affect a planet&#8217;s atmosphere on geologic timescales.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study considers a variety of possibilities for &#8220;false positives&#8221; and provides guidelines for assessing methane biosignatures.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two things that could go wrong&#8212;you could misinterpret something as a biosignature and get a false positive, or you could overlook something that&#8217;s a real biosignature,&#8221; Krissansen-Totton said. &#8220;With this paper, we wanted to develop a framework to help avoid both of those potential errors with methane.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that there is still a lot of work to be done to fully understand any future methane detections. &#8220;This study is focused on the most obvious false positives for methane as a biosignature,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The atmospheres of rocky exoplanets are probably going to surprise us, and we will need to be cautious in our interpretations. Future work should try to anticipate and quantify more unusual mechanisms for nonbiological methane production.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Thompson and Krissansen-Totton, the coauthors of the paper include Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, Myriam Telus, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC, and Nicholas Wogan at the University of Washington, Seattle.

This year, the conference will explore climate change on a local level through three days of free events, April 21-23.</p>
<p>Taking place during UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/">Alumni Week 2022</a>, the public lecture series brings together scientists, artists, policy experts, and community members to discuss the planet&#8217;s wellbeing and share solutions for the future.</p>
<p>The Confronting Climate Change Conference begins with an evening of panelist presentations about how climate change is affecting the Santa Cruz County community through sea level rise, storm intensity, water supply, fishery health and food production. The conference will then engage with the UC Santa Cruz campus and surrounding community with the opening of a new art exhibit, and an Earth Day celebration at the new Climate Action Market to round out the weekend.</p>
<p>&#8220;This conference inspires conversation and thought on how research in the natural and social sciences and beyond can lead to climate change solutions that will help preserve the health of our planet,&#8221; said Paul Koch, professor of Earth and planetary science and dean of the UCSC Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, which is cosponsoring the event. &#8220;The discussion about how we can mitigate and adapt in Santa Cruz will be both inspiring and vital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Climate change has immense and direct impacts on our community,&#8221; said Katharyne Mitchell, professor of sociology and dean of the UCSC Division of Social Sciences, a conference cosponsor. &#8220;The effects cut across nearly every aspect of life in our community, including some less-obvious impacts, such as social justice and equity.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Conference Schedule</h2>
<ul>
<li>Thursday, April 21: Take a deep dive into responses to climate impacts around the world and right here in Santa Cruz County. Attend in person or virtually for a panel discussion at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, &#8220;<a href="https://confrontingclimatechange.ucsc.edu/program/speakers.html"><strong>Responding to the impacts of climate change in Santa Cruz County</strong></a>,&#8221; featuring short talks by four experts from the sciences, Santa Cruz County community, and the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band. Hear what they&#8217;re seeing in the field, learn how everyone can adapt and mitigate impacts of a changing climate, and participate in a Q&amp;A discussion.</li>
<li>Friday, April 22: Check out the introduction of <strong><em>Strange Weather</em></strong>, a new exhibition at downtown Santa Cruz&#8217;s hub for community creativity, the Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History. The UC Santa Cruz Institute of Arts &amp; Sciences is sponsoring the show, <em>Strange Weather: Contemporary Art from the Collections of Jordan D. Schnitzer and His Family Foundation.</em></li>
<li>Saturday, April 23: Cap off the weekend at the <strong>Climate Action Market</strong>, a family-friendly festival at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. Dozens of researchers, nonprofits, businesses, and public agencies will set up booths to share the science and environmental work happening here in Santa Cruz County and show how people can get involved. Enjoy food, music, and games alongside science and climate action.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Creating a space where community members can engage with each other about climate change on an approachable level is paramount to finding creative solutions that help us adjust to a new normal,&#8221; said Jonathan Hicken, executive director of the Seymour Marine Discovery Center at UCSC.</p>
<p>The Climate Action Market on Saturday welcomes the public back to the Seymour Center, a community-supported marine science education center. The facility was closed to visitors for more than a year and a half during the pandemic. Recently reopened and with new leadership, the Seymour Center is a hub where scientists and community members can collaborate and learn from one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sharing science and environmental stewardship with the public creates meaningful connections that we have missed,&#8221; Hicken said. &#8220;We look forward to taking part in these conversations and more.&#8221;</p>

This course, titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasonable Doubts: Making an Exoneree</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, aims for nothing less than to free wrongfully convicted persons currently incarcerated in American prisons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now underway and in its 12th week, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making an Exoneree</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pairs UCSC film and digital media majors with undergraduate students at Georgetown University who are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">working together as investigative journalists, documentarians, and social justice activists to make the case for the innocence of five people behind bars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students are reinvestigating the original crimes and convictions and documenting the main issues, challenges, injustices, and stories involved in each case, producing short documentary films, interactive documentaries, and social media campaigns designed to provide humanizing portraits of the incarcerated people&#8217;s lives and complicated legal cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says Daniel, whose own artistic work has long focused on the criminal justice system, &#8220;Media plays a critical role in work like this. It reveals. It creates public records. It persuades. So many resources are required to overturn a conviction, and a high profile is one of them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel is co-teaching the class with <span>Professor of Government and Law at Georgetown Marc Howard</span> and his childhood friend, Adjunct Professor Marty Tankleff, who was himself wrongfully convicted and incarcerated for almost 18 years before being exonerated. Howard and Tankleff developed Georgetown&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.makinganexoneree.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making an Exonoree</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> course in 2018, and its students have already won the release of three men and made significant progress in the legal prospects of several others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel approached Howard and Tankleff after developing a close bond with Timothy James Young who has been on Death Row at San Quentin State Prison since 2006 and who became familiar to UCSC faculty and staff through the Institute of the Arts and Sciences&#8217; groundbreaking </span><a href="https://ias.ucsc.edu/content/2021/visualizing-abolition"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visualizing Abolition</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative. As part of this ongoing series of exhibitions and programs focused on prison abolition, artist jackie summel established the participatory public sculpture and garden project, </span><a href="https://ias.ucsc.edu/content/2020/solitary-garden-jackie-sumell"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solitary Garden</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at UCSC&#8217;s Baskin Arts Studios in 2019, collaborating with Young, who directs the garden and its plantings through letter exchanges with students and volunteers that continue to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with plant lists and garden designs, Young shares personal reflections on his life in prison and prior in his </span><a href="https://ias.ucsc.edu/timyoungletters"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. His relationship with Arts Division staff and students has deepened, and a robust community of friends and supporters has taken root at UCSC, Daniel amongst them. Young became a primary contributor to an interactive documentary, </span><a href="https://unjustlyexposed.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXPOSED</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that Daniel made about COVID-19 in prisons.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel appealed to Howard and Tankleff to take on Young&#8217;s case for the 2022 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exoneree</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> course, to which they agreed after reviewing substantial evidence of official misconduct in the case. It had also long been her desire to teach a class like this, and the Georgetown team was enthusiastic about collaboration. The partners will make it annual.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Working in the world like this is so incredibly valuable for the students, and the course has had a dramatic impact on them,&#8221; says Daniel. &#8220;They have all told me they plan to continue their work on these campaigns after it&#8217;s done.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Film major Allison Dean, who is part of the group assigned to Young&#8217;s case, is all in. &#8220;I&#8217;m definitely sticking with it after the course is over,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The first time I got a letter back from Tim, saw his handwriting and read his questions for me, it was just so moving. This man trusts me to do this really important work, so I&#8217;m going to keep making sure his story gets heard.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fellow film major Sullivan Gaudreault concurs. &#8220;This was an opportunity to work on something that could change someone&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s so much more meaningful than making something for a grade,&#8221; he says. &#8220;My short term goal is to get Tim&#8217;s voice out into the world to as many people as we can reach, but long term, I&#8217;m really looking forward to the day that Tim can come see his garden here at UCSC.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Notification of Ian&#8217;s passing came from his father Tom. Ian was just 36 years old. At this time, the family is asking for privacy and time to grieve this tragic loss.</span><br/><br/><span>Ian started his career at UCSC on September 20, 2018 at Rachel Carson Dining Hall and over the last four years has worked at just about every Dining Hall. Ian became interested in cooking at a very young age watching &#8220;Yan Can Cook&#8221; on public television. His interest intensified by the Food Network, Ian entered culinary school at the age of 16. With 18 years of professional cooking experience, Ian competed in the Dining Services Culinary Challenge. </span><br/><br/><span>His bio reads in part &#8220;I have learned many things from my career but the foremost of them is not a culinary technique; it is the understanding that the curiosity I felt as a young child watching a man with a knife turn a cucumber into a flower is what drives innovation in all fields. So learn as much as you can, from whoever you can, about whatever you can.&#8221; </span><br/><br/><span>Ian&#8217;s wife Margaret said of her husband &#8220;Ian was as passionate a father as he was a chef.&#8221;</span><br/><br/><span>All of us will sorely miss Ian and our UCSC Dining Family offer our sincere condolences to the McNeilly Family.</span><br/><br/><span>Sad and shocking news can often be difficult to process.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presentation focused on the campus&#8217;s four major goals:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advancing student success by improving retention and graduation rates and by closing equity gaps;&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">elevating UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s research profile and increasing the impact of research;&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fostering an inclusive campus climate that embraces and values equity, diversity and inclusion; and&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improving the efficiency, effectiveness, resilience, and sustainability of operations.&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At UC Santa Cruz we embrace our challenges and opportunities as we work together to achieve our goals,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;Over the next decade we will chart a path for affordable access, equity and research impact that embraces our values of sustainability and social justice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chancellor Larive delivered a </span><a href="https://youtu.be/AK45bmx1g6Y?t=16906"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15-minute presentation on the campus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a high-level summary of a </span><a href="https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/mar22/j2.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">detailed 40-page report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was shared with Regents weeks in advance.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regents were overwhelmingly positive in their remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regent John A. P&#233;rez noted that the campus holds the distinction of being one of only two members of the Association of American Universities (AAU) designated both as an Hispanic Serving Institution and an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution. Some institutions look at those designations simply as headcounts, he said, but it&#8217;s apparent after reading the report and seeing the presentation that UCSC &#8220;takes the S&#8221; in those phrases seriously and looks to truly serve its students through an &#8220;equity lens.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus report detailed how UCSC is advancing student success by focusing on closing equity gaps and going beyond traditional metrics like passing rates in gateway courses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P&#233;rez was among the Regents who were complimentary of the campus goal to further diversify the faculty. The campus is working to increase the percentage of faculty who are under-represented minorities (Hispanic/Latinx, Indigenous, or Black) from 17 percent to 25 percent over the next decade and achieve gender parity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are improved outcomes for students when we see that kind of (improved) representation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Thank you for being bold in setting a goal and timelines that we can judge ourselves against. That is a significant increase in a measurable period of time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chancellor Larive said she believes UCSC can realistically achieve that number if trends that the campus has seen continue. The percentage of faculty from groups traditionally underrepresented in higher education increased from 12.6 percent to 17 percent over the past decade, she noted, with focused efforts leading to strong gains over the past two to three years. A recently announced campus initiative to hire 100 new faculty over the next 10 years, coupled with an anticipated 200 to 250 additional faculty hires to replace departures due to retirement and separations, give UCSC the unparalleled opportunity to diversify its faculty, Larive added. It is the most significant faculty hiring effort the campus has pursued since its founding nearly 60 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the faculty-hiring initiative was detailed in the report as the greatest opportunity for the campus, housing &#8212; both the strong need for it and the difficulty campus has had in its attempts to build more of it &#8212; was singled out as the biggest challenge.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz is one of the least affordable housing markets in the country, but more than just being expensive, there is limited housing for purchase or for rent, Larive told the Regents. Rental vacancies have ranged between 1-2 percent since 2013. The loss of nearly 1,000 homes in the county to the 2020 CZU wildfires, along with the increased location flexibility for Silicon Valley workers, has exacerbated the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus strategy to address this challenge has been to align campus housing with future growth. UCSC&#8217;s 2021 Long Range Development Plan, approved by Regents in September, plans to provide housing for 100 percent of in-person enrollment above the 19,500 specified by the last campus LRDP, approved in 2005. The Kresge College renewal project now underway is an example of the campus strategy to meet that goal by planning, building and delivering student housing projects on an ongoing basis. The project, currently in construction, will deliver new classrooms, student-support spaces, and undergraduate student beds. As the campus prepares to launch the second phase of the project, planners are pursuing design options that could ultimately add 500 additional beds to the project.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus has also sought to add housing through Student Housing West, which was proposed more than four years ago. It is designed to provide about 3,000 beds for current students as well as a new child-care center, operated by the campus, to serve the children of both students and employees. The project cleared a major legal hurdle last month with an appellate court ruling in favor of the university. One pending lawsuit, however, is still holding up the project.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">System leaders took notice of the campus efforts to address the problem. Regent Richard Leib, who assumed the role of chair of the Board of Regents earlier this month, complimented Larive for what he called &#8220;being bold,&#8221; facing difficult challenges such as housing and trying to come up with real solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P&#233;rez wanted to know what it is that the campus truly needs from Regents &#8220;to help you get to where you&#8217;re trying to get.&#8221; Larive again pointed to the housing crisis. &#8220;That will come, I think, in the form of additional flexibility in financing. It is a situation where we can fill those beds, those buildings will pay for themselves in time, but working with the Office of the President, we&#8217;re going to need flexibility to borrow the money to build that housing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regents have requested a Strategic Campus Overview from each of the 10 UC campuses. UCSC is the third campus to give a report, following San Francisco and Davis. The presentations aim to give the Regents a thorough understanding of each campus, providing valuable context when campus leaders appear before them with capital projects or programmatic plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased that our goals were well-received,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;UC Santa Cruz is a remarkable place. Our students, staff and faculty are pushing boundaries in countless fields, yet we are united by a common purpose &#8212;&#160; to create lasting positive change in the world. My hope is that the Regents will see our greater vision when we bring future projects and plans to them.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d22f87678072704664be42b41a534e3c"><name>seed-funding-grants-2022</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Seed funding grants for early-stage research,  creative projects given to 19 awardees</title><summary>The UCSC Office of Research has awarded funds this month to 19 projects through its inaugural Seed Funding for Early Stage Initiatives program</summary><start-date>1648450800000</start-date><path>/2022/03/seed-funding-grants-2022</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/seed-funding-grants-2022</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1648498804540</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648663864568</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Arts</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value><value>Electrical Engineering</value><value>Computer Science</value><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value><value>Physics</value><value>Environmental Toxicology</value><value>Ocean Sciences</value><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value><value>Environmental Studies</value><value>Psychology</value><value>Sociology</value><value>Education</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Elisa Smith</name><title></title><phone/><email>esmith16@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/unnamed.png</path><link>site://news/2022/unnamed.png</link><site>news</site><name>unnamed.png</name><display-name>unnamed.png</display-name><file-size>7307</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC Office of Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has awarded funds this month to 19 projects through its inaugural</span><a href="https://ucsc.infoready4.com/#competitionDetail/1853173"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Seed Funding for Early Stage Initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a primary goal of the seed funds is the submission of a major federal or philanthropic grant application, other measurable outcomes might include the availability of new research or artistic infrastructure; robust preliminary data; a formal pitch to a publisher; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or laying the groundwork for creative works such as exhibitions or films.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This new program showcases the depth of our collaboration both on campus and in the community and how our faculty are innovating across intellectual boundaries,&#8221; said John MacMillan, interim vice chancellor for research. &#8220;I look forward to seeing what these diverse groups can accomplish in their work together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The projects represent 25 units across campus in five academic divisions and the Division of Student Affairs &amp; Success. Six projects feature cross-divisional collaborations, and several projects include community or government partners.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain lions fear humans and alter their behavior in order to avoid areas with high housing density, where human activity is most obvious. But it&#8217;s actually areas of intermediate housing density that prove the most lethal for pumas in the Santa Cruz Mountains. That&#8217;s largely because these areas are where conflicts arise over livestock. Between 2009 and 2019, the leading cause of death for mountain lions in the region was &#8220;retaliatory killings,&#8221; where a landowner kills a puma for preying on livestock&#8212;most often goats kept in small numbers on rural residential properties.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers analyzed data on retaliatory killings over this 10-year time period and found that they accounted for 36% of all puma mortality and the majority of human-caused deaths. The team then looked for patterns in the distribution of risk from these killings over space and time. They compared this with tracking data from pumas outfitted with GPS collars, which shows how the cats choose habitats. This comparison demonstrated what is likely a mismatch between pumas&#8217; perception of risk and actual risk from humans over 17% of the study area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Wilmers, a professor of environmental studies who leads the </span><a href="http://www.santacruzpumas.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz Puma Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was the senior author on the paper, and Anna Nisi, a former graduate researcher in Wilmers&#8217; lab, was the study&#8217;s lead author. The team believes their findings show that humans are &#8220;unpredictable predators&#8221; for pumas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The people who carry out retaliatory killings are distributed in places where there are fewer cues related to overall levels of human activity that pumas can use to understand risk,&#8221; Nisi explained. &#8220;So, while pumas usually behave in ways that allow them to avoid encountering humans, there are places that appear safe to them that actually carry a lot of risk.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumas did tend to avoid regions of intermediate housing density during the day, but they seemed to actually prefer these high-risk habitats at night. Researchers didn&#8217;t find any indication that this was related to hunting behavior. Domestic animals make up only 4% of puma diets, and the team&#8217;s analysis showed that pumas killed for preying on livestock weren&#8217;t skinnier than others and hadn&#8217;t gone longer since the last kill of their primary food source: deer. This means pumas likely weren&#8217;t attracted to these areas because of the opportunity to eat livestock. The research team has a different theory.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Pumas' spatial requirements are quite large, which means that, in the Santa Cruz Mountains, most animals have some degree of habitat fragmentation in their home ranges,&#8221; Nisi said. &#8220;We think the reason why we see them using these intermediate housing density areas at night is that they simply need to traverse these spaces, so they end up doing that at night, when there's less chance of encountering a person.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, crossing these areas at night doesn&#8217;t spare pumas from chance encounters with livestock. And if a mountain lion seizes the opportunity for an easy meal, they may then become a target for retaliatory killing. Hunting or killing of mountain lions has been illegal in California since 1990, but there are exceptions for the protection of livestock. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife issues &#8220;depredation permits&#8221; that allow for killing of mountain lions in verified instances when a domestic animal has been attacked.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of retaliatory killings analyzed in the study were permitted. However, after the study period, the process for issuing depredation permits in the Santa Cruz Mountains changed significantly. In 2020, local pumas received temporary special protections as part of a proposal to list certain regional populations of mountain lions under the California Endangered Species Act. These temporary protections require a step-wise process of nonlethal efforts to deter mountain lions before a depredation permit can be issued.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nisi says improved animal care practices&#8212;like keeping livestock in a covered enclosure at night&#8212;can significantly reduce the risk of pumas preying on domestic animals. If the proposal to list local mountain lions under the California Endangered Species Act is approved, these types of nonlethal measures might become a first-resort on a more permanent basis. Also, Chris Wilmers, who has been studying local mountain lions for over a decade, says he hopes the new paper&#8217;s findings will draw attention to the broader issue of how development patterns set the stage for conflict.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This study is an example of how low-density, exurban areas are where we see the most human-wildlife conflict, and that can turn a place that could have been a potential habitat into an area with high mortality,&#8221; Wilmers said. &#8220;I think that should give us pause about how much of this type of sprawl we're allowing across the landscape, especially since it&#8217;s the most rapidly increasing kind of development throughout the American West.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1973, renowned ecologist and environmental studies faculty member Ken Norris launched a new course that would become a beloved UC Santa Cruz tradition: </span><a href="https://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/about/ken-norris/teaching-philosophy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural History Field Quarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the program&#8217;s early years, Norris would load up a big blue bus with a teaching assistant, a stockpile of outdoor gear, and about 20 eager UC Santa Cruz students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re off on the greatest adventure of our lives!&#8221; Norris would proclaim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the group would disappear into the wilderness. They studied natural history while camping in reserves across the state as part of a series of expeditions over the course of the academic quarter. Students learned new research skills, forged deeper connections with nature, and built community. For many, it was a transformational experience. And it&#8217;s one that UCSC students can still take part in today.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ken Norris taught Natural History Field Quarter until his retirement in 1990, and though he died several years later, the course is one of many aspects of his legacy that have endured. Natural History Field Quarter is now a 15-unit environmental studies course offered each spring and co-taught by Ryan Carle and Chris Lay, the current director of the Kenneth S. Norris Center for Natural History. The course utilizes the </span><a href="https://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/about/ken-norris/natural-reserve-system.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Natural Reserve System</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;another product of Norris&#8217; legacy&#8212;to teach students about the state&#8217;s diverse ecosystems.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norris&#8217; huge impact at UCSC also inspired the creation of the Kenneth S. Norris Center for Natural History in 2014. Part natural history museum and part resource center, the Norris Center aims to broaden the powerful transformative experience of Norris&#8217; Natural History Field Quarter class through additional classes, internships, research projects, community-building events, and collaborations with other organizations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, on the 50th anniversary of Natural History Field Quarter, the Norris Center will sponsor an inclusive weekend gathering for the entire UCSC natural history community to celebrate the first 50 years of natural history programs on campus and collectively envision the future. Anyone who has participated in the many natural history-related opportunities thriving at UCSC today is welcome to attend.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From June 3 through June 5, this gathering will bring together UC Santa Cruz alumni, faculty, staff, current students, and community members for a weekend of camping, outdoor activities, networking events, workshops, live music, and more at YMCA Camp Jones Gulch in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Online registration is required for attendance, and information on pricing, accommodation, COVID-19 precautions, and activities is available on the </span><a href="https://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/events/50-years-of-wonder1.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">event page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norris Center Director Chris Lay hopes the gathering will be an opportunity for those who care about the natural world to have fun together, reflect on shared values, and support one another. Lay believes that building a strong, supportive community in natural history is crucial, especially given the heaviness of the environmental issues that the field is working to address.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One big goal of this event is to gather together and remind ourselves of the things we can do to keep our spirits up and to make a positive difference for the natural world,&#8221; Lay said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Emeritus of Environmental Studies Steve Gliessman&#8212;who taught Natural History Field Quarter alongside Ken Norris </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">beginning in the Spring of 1981</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and later led the program from 1990 to 2012&#8212;said that many former students have gone on to become protectors of the environment, whether through careers in policy, conservation science, teaching, or the arts. And in many cases, students credited the course for helping to spark their passion.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being fully immersed in nature changes your whole perspective on yourself, your role in nature, and the role you can play in the future, and that&#8217;s a deep, heartfelt experience for our students,&#8221; Gliessman said. &#8220;Once people become completely comfortable in nature and see that they&#8217;re part of it, that stays in them and with them always.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One former Natural History Field Quarter student, Sheryl &#8220;Shoo&#8221; Salasky (Rachel Carson &#8217;78), went on to work for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game for a decade, helped with cleanup efforts in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, and became a commercial fisher. Salasky credits Natural History Field Quarter and Ken Norris&#8217; teaching style with helping to build her confidence to continuously try new things throughout her career. She also admired how Norris always made learning fun and memorable.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the things that made field quarter so magical was Ken&#8217;s exuberance and his playful curiosity about everything,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He was equally as excited to show us a little stink bug as a bighorn sheep. To Ken, all living things were fascinating.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current UC Santa Cruz student Dmitrius Rodriguez, who is studying environmental studies, economics, and philosophy, participated in Natural History Field Quarter last spring and said the personal connections and memories from that experience will likely last a lifetime. They still recall vividly the sights, smells, and feeling of excitement from one day in particular, as the group hiked over a mountain in the Sierra Nevada and down into Mono Basin. Rodriguez says that moment was made possible, in part, by the program&#8217;s efforts to make the outdoors more accessible and inclusive.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I come from a background that made me feel like there was a barrier to the outside world, and Natural History Field Quarter tore down that barrier,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Now, I know that I can spend six weeks in nature out in a tent, and I may have been a little uncomfortable, but I have the ability and skills, and I have a trust in myself that I didn&#8217;t have before. I really enjoy backpacking and doing other things outdoors that would make my family nervous, but doing these things is important for my personal growth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Lay said he hopes that gathering current UCSC students and alumni at the upcoming event will create opportunities to discuss how the Norris Center&#8217;s programs might continue evolving to meet the needs of new generations of budding naturalists. He also hopes networking could help graduates find career opportunities that allow them to pursue their passions, which is something that Sheryl &#8220;Shoo&#8221; Salasky is especially excited to support.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looking back, a lot of what I did in my life wasn&#8217;t necessarily planned; I just said yes to what sounded exciting, and what helped me along the way were the connections I had made with likeminded people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Those connections support us and give us confidence to do good in the world. Others did that for me, and I want to pay that forward.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d675ceee8072704664be42b45de8a3a3"><name>employee-labor-relations</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Interim leaders selected for Employee and Labor Relations</title><summary>Effective April 12, Barbara Greening and Sabrina Shaver will share the leadership roles for labor relations and employee relations, respectively. </summary><start-date>1648537200000</start-date><display-name>Employee and Labor Relations</display-name><path>/2022/03/employee-labor-relations</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/employee-labor-relations</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1648570519253</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648570519253</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Colleagues,&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer Schiffner will be leaving UC Santa Cruz effective April 11, 2022. She has accepted an exciting new position as the director of Employee Relations for North America with VISA International, based out of Foster City. This move allows Jen to focus on some of her HR passions, like building out performance management and conflict resolution strategies for a broad and diverse employee population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is bittersweet news for all of us. We will miss her dearly but are very happy to know she will be starting a new career adventure.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since joining our campus in 2014, Jen has made so many outstanding contributions to SHR and our campus mission. She has built a strong ELR team; she has been an exceptional contributor on our SHR leadership team; she has advised the chancellor, CP/EVC and other leaders on a myriad of complicated employee and labor related issues. Most of all she has been a role model of our values and principles of community as she has gone about her work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effective April 12, Barbara Greening and Sabrina Shaver will share the leadership roles for labor relations and employee relations, respectively. They will both report to me and serve on the SHR leadership team. The three of us are collaborating on this transition and we will continue our efforts to ensure we are working as effectively as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks and appreciation to Barbara and Sabrina for their team spirit and commitment to work side-by-side until at least the end of June or until otherwise notified.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabrina will be responsible for all employee relations matters such as COVID compliance, performance management and policy compliance. In addition, Sabrina will attend committee and other meetings that traditionally have employee relations presence both locally as well as represent our campus on system-wide projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbara will be responsible for all labor relations matters such as bargaining, grievances, requests for information, Article 5 and other labor relations compliance issues, and terminations. In addition, Barbara will attend committee and other meetings that traditionally have labor relations presence, including systemwide labor projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ELR team will continue to function as one unit, in which Sabrina and Barbara will share the leadership roles of running meetings and overall supervision within their respective sub-units.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please join me in thanking Jennifer for her service to UC Santa Cruz and Sabrina and Barbara for helping lead the team during this transition.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Steve Stein, Associate Vice Chancellor, Staff Human Resources</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d699770e8072704664be42b4a73efcf5"><name>nlp-liveperson-fellowships</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC Ph.D. students dive deep into engineering open-domain dialogue AI with the support of industry partners </title><summary>LivePerson, which builds conversational AI, is funding two students' study of the models that drive chatbots, digital assistants, and more&#13;

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The complexities of spoken and written conversation present major challenges for artificial intelligence (AI) models that emulate and participate in conversations, from digital assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple&#8217;s Siri to chatbots used on retail and commerce websites, and much more.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Dialogue and conversation are the most fundamental method of communication,&#8221; said Davan Harrison, a candidate for a Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;Being able to achieve that level of comfort and ease of communication in&#160;areas where it doesn't currently exist can potentially have large effects wherever people communicate, especially where there is some sort of educational or skill barrier to communicating with an entity or organization.&#8221;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harrison and Wen Cui, both Ph.D. students in the Natural Language and Dialogue Systems Lab led by professor of computer engineering Marilyn Walker, are working to address some of these AI challenges in their research. Their work is supported by fellowships from <a href="https://www.liveperson.com/"><span class="s2">LivePerson</span></a>, which builds conversational AI experiences for a variety of industries and uses and has been <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90724347/most-innovative-companies-artificial-intelligence-2022"><span class="s2">recognized as a top innovator</span></a> in AI.&#160;&#160;</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both students are working toward making better AI for open-domain dialogues, which are conversations not specific to a particular industry or subject area. These types of dialogues are common with devices like Alexa and Siri, and underpin other technologies such as chatbots that can be used in a wide variety of different industries from retail to mobile banking.</span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students doing research in NLP as well as students enrolled in UCSC&#8217;s NLP professional masters program benefit from collaboration with industry partners and mentors who can help them better understand the wants and needs of the companies that may hire them. For example, last year Harrison and Cui collaborated directly with NLP masters students on a UCSC team competing in the <a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/news/baskin-engineering-students-advance-finals-years-amazon-alexa-prize-challenge"><span class="s2">Alexa prize competition</span></a> by Amazon focused on open-domain dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Studying open-domain dialogue presents unique challenges and opportunities for our NLP students to make models that talk like humans do,&#8221; said Marilyn Walker, director of the NLP Program and professor of computer science and engineering. &#8220;It's an area that's becoming increasingly relevant in today's industry. LivePerson fields conversational systems that carry out almost one billion conversations a month. Our collaboration with LivePerson will help us understand better the research that is needed to make these systems more natural and useful. My students&#8217; work within these areas will shape how people interact with the products that can make the world more accessible and easier to navigate.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The two Ph.D. students&#8217; research focuses on different aspects of the AI algorithms designed for open-domain dialogue; Cui is focused on named-entity linking, while Harrison is studying dialogue management.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cui&#8217;s work aims to develop a better system for entity linking, the connection of entities like &#8220;Lebron James&#8221; or &#8220;the Earth&#8221; to their various meanings in an existing database of knowledge &#8211; in this case, <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page"><span class="s2">Wikidata</span></a> with its more than 97 million open-source data items. This can improve the performance of dialogue systems in how they understand human speech and generate better responses in open-domain dialogues, where conversations can quickly switch topics and often revolve around popular entities such as recent movies or new songs. Her work so far has proven that providing the AI training model with semantic information representing the context of the&#160; conversation improves the performance of that model.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cui is working with a team at LivePerson that annotates conversational data to learn how people use entities in their spoken or written conversations. By incorporating annotated data from LivePerson, she aims to better understand the role of discourse models in entity linking for dialogue and test various algorithms.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cui said she hopes to be able to make the model she trained live and use it for interactions with real people, to learn from the way that they talk with it. Testing the system with real data and users can help the researchers evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harrison&#8217;s work is on dialogue managers, an aspect of AI dialogue models that control the flow of a conversation, in more casual, chit-chat style settings.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently, he is focused on incorporating principles from formal linguistics about the flow of conversations, called discourse relations, into AI models in order to better guide open-domain dialogue. Annotating the logical relations of a conversation could help machines better navigate conversations that bounce around from one subject to the next.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harrison says collaborating with researchers in industry allows for a productive exchange of ideas. Companies are often working on similar problems but may have a different perspective because they have access to different information and understand the unique contours of the particular problem they are working on.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;There could be some situation where conversation can be really helpful and beneficial to someone that I'm not aware of, but a company is, because that&#8217;s their bread and butter,&#8221; Harrison said. &#8220;There's so many open problems in the field.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Since the first working draft of a human genome sequence was assembled at UC Santa Cruz in 2000, genomics research has led to enormous advances in our understanding of human biology and disease. Nevertheless, crucial regions accounting for some 8% of the human genome have remained hidden from scientists for over 20 years due to the limitations of DNA sequencing technologies.</p>
<p>In 2019, Karen Miga, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, and Adam Phillippy at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) organized an international team of scientists&#8212;the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium&#8212;to fill in the missing pieces. Their efforts have now paid off.</p>
<p>The new reference genome, called T2T-CHM13, adds nearly 200 million base pairs of novel DNA sequences, including 99 genes likely to code for proteins and nearly 2,000 candidate genes that need further study. It also corrects thousands of structural errors in the current reference sequence.</p>
<p>The gaps now filled by the new sequence include the entire short arms of five human chromosomes and cover some of the most complex regions of the genome. These include highly repetitive DNA sequences found in and around important chromosomal structures such as the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes and the centromeres that coordinate the separation of replicated chromosomes during cell division. The new sequence also reveals previously undetected segmental duplications, long stretches of DNA that are duplicated in the genome and are known to play important roles in evolution and disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;These parts of the human genome that we haven&#8217;t been able to study for 20-plus years are important to our understanding of how the genome works, genetic diseases, and human diversity and evolution,&#8221; Miga said.</p>
<p>Many of the newly revealed regions have important functions in the genome even if they do not include active genes.</p>
<h2>Top of the mountain</h2>
<p>&#8220;There is a profound advantage to seeing the whole genome as a complete system. It puts us in a position to unravel how that system works,&#8221; said David Haussler, director of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute. &#8220;We&#8217;ve gotten an enormous understanding of human biology and disease from having roughly 90 percent of the human genome, but there were many important aspects that lay hidden, out of view of science, because we did not have the technology to read those portions of the genome. Now we can stand at the top of the mountain and see all of the landscape below and get a complete picture of our human genetic heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The T2T genome sequence, representing the finished CHM13 genome plus the recently finished T2T Y chromosome (CHM13 includes an X but not a Y chromosome), is now a new reference genome in the UCSC Genome Browser. The T2T sequence is fully annotated in the browser, providing an efficient way for scientists to access and visualize a wealth of information associated with genes and other elements of the genome.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to put the information out in a way that is accessible and familiar to researchers so they can begin to build on it and use all the tools and resources the browser provides,&#8221; Miga explained.</p>
<p>The new T2T reference genome will complement the standard human reference genome, known as Genome Reference Consortium build 38 (GRCh38), which had its origins in the publicly funded Human Genome Project and has been continually updated since the first draft in 2000.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re adding a second complete genome, and then there will be more,&#8221; explained Haussler. &#8220;The next phase is to think about the reference for humanity&#8217;s genome as not being a single genome sequence. This is a profound transition, the harbinger of a new era in which we will eventually capture human diversity in an unbiased way.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Human pangenome reference</h2>
<p>The T2T Consortium has now joined with the <a href="https://humanpangenome.org/">Human Pangenome Reference Consortium</a>, which aims to create a new &#8220;human pangenome reference&#8221; based on the complete genome sequences of 350 individuals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pangenomics is about capturing the diversity of the human population, and it&#8217;s also about ensuring we&#8217;ve captured the whole genome properly,&#8221; said Benedict Paten, associate professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC&#8217;s Baskin School of Engineering, a coauthor of the T2T papers, and a leader of the pangenomics effort. &#8220;Without having a map of these difficult-to-sequence regions of the genome across multiple individuals, then we&#8217;re missing a huge amount of the variation present in our population. T2T sets us up to look across hundreds of genomes from telomere to telomere. It&#8217;s going to be great!&#8221;</p>
<p>The standard reference genome (GRCh38) does not represent any one individual but was assembled from multiple donors. Merging them into one linear sequence created artificial structures in the sequence. The Human Pangenome Project will make it possible to compare newly sequenced genomes to multiple complete genomes representing a range of human ancestries.</p>
<h2>Genetic variants</h2>
<p>An important outcome of the new T2T sequence is enabling more accurate assessments of genetic variants. When human genomes are sequenced for clinical studies to understand the role of genetic variants in disease or to study genetic diversity within and between human populations, they are nearly always analyzed by aligning the sequencing results with the reference genome for comparison. The T2T variant team documented major improvements in identifying and interpreting genetic variants using the new T2T sequence compared to the standard human reference genome.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new human genome is incredibly accurate at the base level, allowing us to flag hundreds of thousands of variants that had been misinterpreted by mapping them to the standard reference. Many of these new variants are in genes known to contribute to disease. We can now spot those because we have a more complete and accurate reference genome,&#8221; Miga said.</p>
<p>Miga&#8217;s research has focused on satellite DNA, the long stretches of repetitive DNA sequences found mostly in and around telomeres and centromeres. The centromeres separate each chromosome into a short arm and a long arm and hold duplicated chromosomes together prior to cell division.</p>
<p>"The centromeres play a critical role in how chromosomes segregate properly during cell division, and we've known for some time now that they are misregulated in all kinds of human diseases. But we've never been able to study them at the sequence level," Miga said. &#8220;By far the largest portion of new sequences added to the reference are centromere satellite DNAs. For the first time, we can study &#8216;base-by-base&#8217; the sequences that define the centromere and can start to understand how it works.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Long-read&#8221; DNA sequencing technologies, such as the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2012/02/nanopore-sequencer.html">nanopore sequencing pioneered at UC Santa Cruz</a>, were essential tools for the T2T Consortium. Two long-read sequencing datasets&#8212;high fidelity reads (HiFi data from PacBio systems) and extremely long reads that routinely reach lengths greater than 100,000 base pairs (ultra-long data from Oxford Nanopore devices)&#8212;enabled T2T researchers to span repetitive regions and develop strategies to ensure that the assembly was highly accurate. Miten Jain and other UCSC Genomics Institute researchers helped establish the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/nanopore-genome.html">ultra-long read protocol</a>.</p>
<h2>Leaders in genomics</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has a long history of leadership in genomics, starting with a seminal meeting in 1985 to discuss the sequencing of the human genome organized at UCSC by then-Chancellor Robert Sinsheimer. Haussler was invited to join the public Human Genome Project in 1999, and his team played a crucial role in its completion. At the time, James Kent, now a research scientist at the Genomics Institute and director of the UCSC Genome Browser project, was a UCSC graduate student. He wrote the code that assembled the first working draft of the human genome from data obtained by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, and UCSC posted the draft online for the whole world to access. Kent then created the UCSC Genome Browser, still the most widely used platform to access the human genome.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute has continued to be at the forefront of genomics research and plays a leading role in the T2T and pangenomics efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The T2T work reflects the sustained and dedicated efforts of many people at UC Santa Cruz and elsewhere. Karen Miga has been working hard to get real centromere sequences into the human genome assemblies for a decade, and this has finally come to fruition!&#8221; said Kent. &#8220;I'm very excited to see this work combined with efforts to get telomere-to-telomere sequences from other human ancestries. We are moving quickly towards a truly complete representation of the human genome.&#8221;</p>

Her whole life, she shared a very close relationship with her children: her daughters Debra and Vicki, her son Jonathan and his wife Susanne.</p>
<p>Miriam was born in New York City in 1927 to Jewish immigrants from Central Europe. Early on she developed a great interest for languages, music, and theater. Her love for French took shape during WWII when the French government in exile did all it could to maintain its language and culture. In 1948 Miriam seized the opportunity to volunteer in a refugee camp in France that served refugees from North Africa and the Middle East. After that experience, she married, had children, and left for Southern California in 1955.</p>
<p>She had finished her high school and done some college work before she went to France. She was thirty when she started taking night classes while caring for her three children. As her <a href="https://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/miriam-ellis">2020 oral history</a> says, &#8220;She then spent the next twenty-two years gradually and steadfastly working through a series of degrees.&#8221; She received highest honors in a BA from Valley State College (now California State University of Northridge) and completed a Master&#8217;s at the same school. Given her great interest in and experience with international students, she became the university&#8217;s Director of the Office of International Programs. During those years, she fulfilled her passion for theater by acting in local productions.</p>
<p>In 1971, she came to UCSC where she left an indelible mark on students and colleagues in French, theater, music (especially opera), and administration. Her initial project was to pursue a PhD in French and Spanish literature at UCSC, a most recent and experimental campus that had started six years before, in 1965. Two of her children also studied at UCSC. She worked very closely with Joe Silverman, an authority on Spanish Golden Age literature, especially Sephardic literature. In 1979, she completed her critical edition and translation of Lope de Vega&#8217;s La Francesilla. She began teaching French and literature as a graduate student in 1971, while doing her doctoral research and pursuing her interests in theater and music. Upon completing her PhD, she became a full-time Lecturer in French, and continued to teach and support French, theater, and opera well past her retirement in 2004. Her role in those three areas was astonishing.</p>
<p>She brought together her teaching of French, work for the theater, and passion for the opera, in such a way that we can speak of a remarkable legacy calling to be continued and furthered. Let us start with her admirable teaching of French and the way she directly contributed to the creation of many new language courses. She had the unusual broad vision of language, trust of colleagues, capacity for hard work, and practical experience in grant application that led the Division of Humanities and the Department of Languages (then the Language Committee) to follow her aegis and support her grant applications to the Language Across the Curriculum program. This was a federal program that provided financial support for the creation of new language courses in which the content would be interdisciplinary (sociological, biological, etc), to the tune of about $250,000. About 30 courses that drew on an exceptional cadre of instructors were created in this manner, thanks to Miriam&#8217;s philosophy of culture and administrative savvy. The French government recognized her outstanding teaching and contributions to French culture in 1999 by awarding her knighthood in the Order of the Palmes acad&#233;miques.</p>
<p>As an actor and director, she helped build theater at UCSC. She saw it as an integral part of the teaching of languages and created the International Playhouse, now named the <a href="https://cowell.ucsc.edu/academics/meip/miriam-ellis-international-playhouse.html">Miriam Ellis International Playhouse</a> (MEIP) and funded thanks to the generosity of donors. This brilliant idea, as thrilling as that of the Language Across the Curriculum program mentioned above, is to have students learn and publically present scenes in the original languages from traditional or modern plays. The students thereby have a new and different experience of the languages they are studying in their language classes and by presenting them to the public with super-titles, the audience can also participate. Plays in four to six languages have been performed each spring since 2001. So far, the languages include Chinese, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Punjabi, Russian and Spanish. This year, watch for announcements regarding season XX of the Miriam Ellis International Playhouse, which will happen on May 20, 21, and 22, 2022 at 8:00 PM in the Stevenson Event Center at UCSC.</p>
<p><span>Miriam worked as a stage director for the Opera Workshop in the seventies and co-founded the Santa Cruz Opera Society, Inc. (SCOSI), starting productions, organizing conferences, and bringing important artists to the audiences. She taught numerous classes on opera, sometimes in cooperation with John Dizikes and Tom Lehrer, either in the Humanities curriculum or for the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) where she was a lifetime member. Notably, she was a co-editor and translator of two important works. She helped with the American premiere of the lost manuscript of </span><span>Les visitandines</span><span> by Fran&#231;ois Devienne (1759-1803) that Sherwood Dudley, a professor of music and conductor at UCSC, had discovered in Lille. It was performed in 1997 at UCSC as part of the inaugural festivities for Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood.</span><span> </span><span>In 2016, again in collaboration with Sherwood Dudley, her translation of the libretto of the </span><span>Nozze di Figaro</span><span>, a major work of Mozart, was published by Passaggio Press as </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Marriage-Figaro-nozze-Flexible/dp/0997730404&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1649284249370000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3BjF8-1yk_nTEzlfOYcqn_" href="https://www.amazon.com/Marriage-Figaro-nozze-Flexible/dp/0997730404" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>The Flexible Figaro</span></a><span>. This was a huge accomplishment and a labor of love that took twenty years of meticulous translating and editing work. A preliminary version of </span><span>Le nozze di Figaro</span><span> had been performed at UCSC in 1989 for a celebration of the bicentenary of the French Revolution. It was marked by the presence of Dani&#232;le Mitterrand, wife of Fran&#231;ois Mitterrand, the French president at the time.

<p>Miles is currently a Ph.D. candidate in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and will conduct her postdoctoral research at the University of Arizona. Dalba is currently at UC Riverside and will begin his postdoctoral fellowship at UC Santa Cruz in fall 2022.</p>
<p>The 51 Pegasi b Fellowships provide exceptional postdoctoral scientists with the opportunity to conduct theoretical, observational, and experimental research in planetary astronomy.</p>
<h2>Brittany Miles</h2>
<p>As a UCSC graduate student, Miles has been working with Andrew Skemer, associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics, to conduct mid-infrared observations of brown dwarfs&#8212;astronomical objects that share properties with both planets and stars. By placing unique constraints on the atmospheric structures of these cold objects, her work provides a template for predicting and interpreting future direct images of cooler exoplanets. Her brown dwarf observations also inform instrumentation projects in which she retrofits and tests detector capabilities to support more precise characterization of exoplanets.</p>
<p>In her postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Arizona, Miles will continue her observations of brown dwarf atmospheres to obtain data on cloud composition and behavior. As co-principal investigator on a James Webb Space Telescope proposal, she will explore the coldest known brown dwarf to inspect possible water clouds and water vapor and infer how such features may behave on gas giant exoplanets. Miles also plans to enhance the sensitivity of ground-based instruments to capture images of more Earth-like planets. Her work will be instrumental to the field as more large telescopes come online in the years ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to continue getting high-quality data on single targets to understand what gases are in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs, and answer bigger questions about how planets form and what their atmospheres look like,&#8221; Miles said. &#8220;No matter what my project results are, I think they will provide the community with a useful data set on what brown dwarfs and directly imaged exoplanets look like.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Paul Dalba</h2>
<p>Dalba works at the overlap of theory and observation, studying exoplanets akin to Jupiter and Saturn that orbit their host stars over long time periods. He leads the Giant Outer Transiting Exoplanet Mass Survey (GOT &#8217;EM), a program at the W. M. Keck Observatory and UC&#8217;s Lick Observatory to determine the masses of his targets. He also coordinates intercontinental campaigns that enlist community scientists in days-long observations of exoplanets slowly passing in front of their host stars. Dalba&#8217;s efforts to characterize relatively unexplored worlds expand the boundaries of observable objects and place our solar system in sharper perspective.</p>
<p>In his fellowship at UC Santa Cruz, Dalba will advance his GOT &#8217;EM findings to characterize a valuable set of giant exoplanets. After calculating the mass of each planet, he will investigate their metal compositions to tell a complete story about their interiors and atmospheres. This work will help answer essential questions about how planetary systems come to be and prepare a selection for examination with the James Webb Space Telescope. Dalba will also work with the SETI Institute to conduct exoplanet observations with the global Unistellar Network of community scientists.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to understand exactly what giant planets are doing because they effectively control the rest of their environment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you can deduce the characteristics of these objects, that provides a full picture of the entire planetary system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dalba earned his Ph.D. in astronomy at Boston University in fall 2018 and is currently working as an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Riverside.</p>
<p>The 51 Pegasi b Fellowship was established in 2017 by the Heising-Simons Foundation, and named for the first exoplanet discovered orbiting a Sun-like star. Miles and Dalba are among eight awardees to receive 2022 fellowships, which provide up to $385,000 of support for independent research over three years.</p>
<p>The growing field of planetary astronomy studies objects both within and beyond our solar system, bridging planetary science and astronomy. From improving our understanding of planetary system formation and evolution, to advancing new technologies for detecting other worlds, 51 Pegasi b Fellows make a unique contribution to the field.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e718efe38072704664be42b430111974"><name>evc-spring-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Spring update; plans for fall; record applications</title><summary>Welcome to spring quarter.

<p><br/>Dear UCSC Community,&#160;</p>
<p>Welcome to spring quarter. I&#8217;m so happy we&#8217;re starting this quarter off on a high note. There&#8217;s much good news to share, but first I want to take a moment to acknowledge the heartbreaking loss of human life and displacement in Ukraine since the invasion by Russian forces six weeks ago. I share with many the hope and prayer that a resolution, so difficult to see right now, brings the return of peace and the maintenance of sovereignty.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Mask Policy Update</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now to a few updates. With the recent updates to state and federal public health guidelines, we have decided to </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/indoor-masking-policy-update.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update our mask policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As of April 10, masks will not be required for most indoor settings at UCSC facilities. Even with this change, the use of masks will continue to be strongly recommended. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masks will still be required on campus public transportation, in the Early Education Services centers, and in clinical settings, such as the Student Health Center and indoor COVID-19 testing sites. We encourage our community to continue to treat each other with respect in this next phase of pandemic response.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we are relaxing the indoor masking policy, vaccination and regular testing requirements remain in place. We need all members of our campus community to continue to follow the </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/protocol.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asymptomatic testing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requirements and </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid-vaccine.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get a booster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as soon as they are eligible. Employees working on-site must continue to log into the </span><a href="https://slugstrong.ucsc.edu/returning-to-campus/checking-for-symptoms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">symptom checker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as it currently is a Cal/OSHA requirement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Plans for Fall 2022</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chancellor Larive and I were happy to announce that we are planning for in-person instruction for this fall - fully in-person (no remote instruction) with online courses as approved by the Academic Senate&#8217;s Committee on Courses of Instruction. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except in rare cases, remote attendance in in-person courses for the entire quarter will not be available in 2022-23. As was the case prior to the pandemic, online courses will make up a small percentage of the overall course offerings during the academic year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to our Banana Slug community for their commitment to minimizing the impacts of COVID-19 and prioritizing our collective well-being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, I want to stress that we will continue to rely on the guidance of our county, state, and federal health leaders, and when needed, enforce mitigation measures to support the well-being of our campus community and operational needs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>UC Regents Presentation</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 17, Chancellor Larive </span><a href="https://youtu.be/AK45bmx1g6Y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shared a bold vision </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the future of UC Santa Cruz with the Board of UC Regents. A </span><a href="https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/mar22/j2.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">detailed 40-page Strategic Campus Overview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was provided in advance laying out how the campus&#8217; strengths, challenges, opportunities, and planning processes are advancing the campus vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The faculty-hiring initiative was detailed in the report as the greatest opportunity for the campus, while housing &#8212; both the strong need for it and the difficulty campus has had in its attempts to build more of it &#8212; was singled out as the biggest challenge. Chancellor Larive and I were very happy with the overwhelmingly positive remarks and feedback from board members.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Record Applications</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are eagerly waiting to find out who will be a part of our new first year, transfer and graduate student cohorts. The university has once again had a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/02/fall-2022-applications.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">record number of undergraduate applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - more than 77,500 from first-year and transfer students. That&#8217;s a 3.5 percent increase over last year. We continued to see interest from the diverse students across our state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a few still open, the Graduate Division has received just under 4,780 applications. That is about the same number as last year and includes masters, MFA, and doctoral programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Infant Care Reopening&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are happy to announce that in fall 2022, Early Education Services (EES) will be </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/ees-infant-care-hours.html?utm_source=03-15-2022&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tuesday-newsday"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reopening its infant care program and expanding the operating hours</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The new hours will be 7:30 am -&#160; 5:30 pm. With the increase of service, additional teachers and teaching assistants will be added.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We anticipate being able to provide care for up to six infants between the ages of 11 and 24 months. As space permits in our toddler program and as infants are ready, they will begin transitioning as early as 18 months.</span></p>
<p><strong>Search for first VC for diversity, equity and inclusion</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/02/vc-diversity-search.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve launched a search for UCSC&#8217;s first vice chancellor for diversity, equity, and inclusion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee will chair the search advisory committee. We hope to have the new leader on campus in the fall. Judith Estrada will continue to serve as the interim chief diversity officer until our new vice chancellor arrives. We&#8217;re grateful for the leadership she provides to our campus and her commitment to transforming our campus.</span></p>
<p><strong>A Breakthrough Achievement</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congratulations to Karen Miga, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, and Adam Phillippy at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) for being </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/t2t-genome.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly complete the sequence of a human genome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, covering each chromosome from end to end with no gaps and unprecedented accuracy. It is now accessible through the </span><a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Genome Browser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is described in six papers published March 31 in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because of their research and others before them, UC Santa Cruz continues to be at the forefront of genomics research and plays a leading role in the Telomere-to-Telomere and pangenomics efforts.</span></p>
<p><strong>Grad Slam</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had the opportunity and honor to serve as a judge at this year&#8217;s </span><a href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/events/grad-slam/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grad Slam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which was held at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center last month. This is a fantastic event where we see the intellectual contributions, energy, exuberance and joy of the research of our graduate students. Being back in person after two years added its own joy. This event is a full-blown collective effort of our Graduate Division colleagues, and I am so grateful to them for a great evening that I know was the culmination of a lot of preparatory and background work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university is advancing comprehensive internationalization to ensure that our students, faculty, and staff are prepared and encouraged to study, teach, conduct research, and work in a global context, and that institutional policies, programs, and initiatives are aligned to achieve this shared goal.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/deep-read-transcendent-kingdom.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Deep Read Launches </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Transcendent Kingdom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Yaa Gyasi is this year&#8217;s selection.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book tells the story of a first-generation PhD student of Neuroscience and her search for the source of human addiction. The novel explores personal loss, the benefits and costs of cultural assimilation for immigrants to the United States, and the contrast between religious faith and scientific inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find more stories highlighting the work, research, and accomplishments of UCSC students, faculty, and staff on the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newscenter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to thank each of you for your part in making it possible for us to relax the mask policy starting April 11th. I never get tired of pointing out that UC Santa Cruz is all about community and because each of you has put community first, we all benefit.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e72aa3b08072704664be42b444f88d01"><name>keynote-transportation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1704118837150</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Supporting affordable, sustainable transportation</title><summary>As global events continue to lead to concerns about climate change, rising inflation, and increased gas prices, many faculty, staff, and students may be seeking more affordable and sustainable transportation options.</summary><start-date>1649055600000</start-date><display-name>Transportation</display-name><path>/2022/03/keynote-transportation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2022/03/keynote-transportation</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1648850805648</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1648850853041</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan Henderson</name><title>Director, Transportation and Parking Services</title><phone/><email>taps@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/03/images/bike-path-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/03/images/bike-path-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bike-path-500px.jpg</name><display-name>bike-path-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>259929</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Bicycle rider on campus bike path</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As global events continue to lead to concerns about climate change, rising inflation, and increased gas prices, many faculty, staff, and students may be seeking more affordable and sustainable transportation options. UCSC and TAPS are committed to providing programs to help reduce barriers to accessing campus through sustainable and shared transportation options. Below are some of the resources our community can take advantage of to ease the cost of transportation to both the individual and the climate:&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>E-bike Financing Programs</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-bikes are gaining in popularity as a way to travel around the hilly UCSC campus. There are several programs and rebates that can help make an ebike more affordable. And for those who qualify, several ebike merchants offer zero- or low-interest financing. </span><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/bike-programs/bike-purchasing-offers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the TAPS website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see which programs are best for you.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Electric Vehicle Programs</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are ready to make the change to an electric vehicle, there are also </span><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/commute-options/electric-vehicles.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several programs and rebates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help reduce the cost. Lower income applicants may also qualify for increased rebates or discounts. And TAPS has </span><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/parking/electric-vehicle-charging.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several options for charging your vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the residential campus and Coastal Science Campus.</span></p>
<p><strong>Vanpool</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC&#8217;s Vanpool program has vans traveling to UCSC from Monterey County, south Santa Cruz County and San Jose. Vanpooling&#160; helps cut down on carbon emissions, reduces travel stress, and saves wear and tear on your car (if you have one). The cost of a Vanpool is partially subsidized, so it saves you money too. </span><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/commute-options/vanpools/vanpool-schedules.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the TAPS website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if there&#8217;s a Vanpool route near you, or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact the Vanpool office</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see about starting a new route.</span></p>
<p><strong>Cruz511 and Go Santa Cruz County</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use </span><a href="https://my.cruz511.org/s/ucsc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruz511</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find a regular carpool, or you can even post a ride for a single trip. Sign up using your UCSC email address to limit your visibility to the private UCSC network. You can also earn gift cards, Zipcar credit, a BikeLink card, a one-month bus pass, or even donate to charity just for traveling to work or class using a sustainable method. You can choose to bike, walk, carpool, vanpool, telecommute, or ride the bus to earn rewards. </span><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/commute-options/go-santa-cruz-county.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up for Go Santa Cruz County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and log your trips to get started.</span></p>
<p><strong>Slug Bike Life</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biking is one of the fastest ways to get around campus and the rest of Santa Cruz. Slug Bike Life provides several programs to help our cycling slugs get around safely. You can build confidence through engaging bike classes, get free helmets and lights to protect yourself while riding, or learn how to choose the best e-bike for you. Visit </span><a href="https://www.slugbikelife.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SlugBikeLife.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to sign up for classes, giveaways and email updates.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Campus Transit and METRO Buses</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TAPS provides campus shuttles to help affiliates travel to destinations on campus, and we have recently increased service on Saturday and Sunday evenings. </span><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/buses-shuttles/campus-shuttles.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the TAPS website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the current Campus Transit schedules.&#160; Students can ride Santa Cruz METRO buses fare-free throughout Santa Cruz County using only their student ID cards (with a current quarter sticker). All UCSC employees may </span><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/buses-shuttles/metro-bus-pass.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase a METRO bus pass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for only $16 per month (a $65 value). </span><a href="https://scmtd.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the Santa Cruz METRO website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for routes and schedules.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Telecommuting and Remote Work</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are eligible, one of the best ways to reduce emissions and costs is to telecommute or work remotely. Talk to your supervisor about a potential hybrid arrangement to work remotely part of the week, or even see if a fully remote agreement would be an option. </span><a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/procedures/telecommuting/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the UCSC website for telecommuting guidelines and resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span>Sustainable transportation not only helps UCSC achieve the goals and benchmarks outlined in the </span><a href="https://sustainabilityplan.ucsc.edu/"><span>Sustainability Plan</span></a><span> and the </span><a href="https://lrdp.ucsc.edu/"><span>Long Range Development Plan</span></a><span>, but it also helps reduce individual transportation costs and carbon emissions. We understand that many affiliates have been affected by the recent upheaval as well as the uncertainty of the last two years of the pandemic. We hope these resources provide additional options you may not have known about previously. Thank you for using sustainable transportation whenever you can.&#160;</span></p>

Masking remains <em>strongly recommended</em> in all indoor campus settings and people may choose to mask at any time. And if the situation changes and case rates trend upward and/or community rating conditions change, we will modify our plans and our guidance.</p>
<p>Those of us who are at high risk or who live with others at high risk for severe illness or who cannot be vaccinated may choose to keep wearing a mask indoors. We recognize that for instructors in this category, who are sharing classroom spaces, office hours, and labs, the lifting of the indoor mask mandate creates some uncertainty and concern. While masking is strongly recommended indoors, including in classrooms, because it is no longer required, it cannot be mandated on a class-by-class basis. But you can recommend continued masking to students and we are providing some suggested language, which will also be posted on the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1649190695603000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pFmGmTU5SdZE7_pZHvfvi" href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Keep Teaching</a> website, for instructors and mentors to use.</p>

<h3>For instructors who plan to mask while teaching and wish to request continued masking from students:</h3>
<p>For a variety of reasons, some people in our community remain particularly vulnerable to or apprehensive about COVID transmission. Out of courtesy for them, I will be wearing a mask in class (and/or during office hours). I would urge you all to consider doing the same.</p>
<h3>Instructors who do not plan to mask while teaching but wish to signal support for those who do:</h3>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong> (instructors who will only unmask during active instruction):</p>
<p>I plan to teach without a mask when policy allows, although I will continue to mask before and after class and during office hours. I ask you to consider wearing a mask in class as a courtesy to those members of our community who may be immunocompromised, have a vulnerable family member at home (such as a child under 5), or remain apprehensive about COVID transmission.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2</strong> (instructors who don&#8217;t plan to mask at all but want to signal support for continued classroom masking):</p>
<p>I plan to teach without a mask when policy allows. However, I ask that you consider continuing to mask in the classroom as a courtesy to those members of our community who may be immunocompromised, have a vulnerable family member at home (such as a child under 5), or remain apprehensive about COVID transmission in situations where social distancing is not possible. If you prefer that I be masked when you are in close proximity to me, please let me know. I will be glad to put my mask on while we talk.</p>
<h3>Instructors who do not plan to mask and who do not plan to ask students to mask:</h3>
<p>Regardless of your personal decision about masking, I ask that you interact in a respectful and considerate way toward those who have made a decision that is different from your own.</p>
<h3>Instructors who do not wish to hold office hours with unmasked students:</h3>
<p>I will be offering both in-person and remote office hours this quarter. I ask that you wear a mask when meeting with me in person. If you prefer to meet without a mask, please sign up for my remote office hours.</p>
