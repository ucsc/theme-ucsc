<p>Situated on two floors of the seven-floor, 150,000 square-foot museum in Cleveland, the exhibition will feature a significant number of items on loan from <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/gratefuldeadarchive/gda-home" title="Grateful Dead Archive">The Grateful Dead Archive</a> at the University of California-Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are about 90 items from the Grateful Dead Archive included in the exhibition,&#8221; noted Howard Kramer, the Hall of Fame's Director of Curatorial Affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are business documents (<em>Warner Bros. Records</em> contract renewal letter, recording session tracking sheets); handwritten lyric manuscripts (including <em>Sugaree</em>, <em>Box of Rain</em> and <em>Truckin&#8217;)</em>; original artwork (Stanley Mouse paintings from the back cover of <em>Workingman&#8217;s Dead</em>); and props used in videos,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><strong>The exhibition will include an unprecedented</strong> collection of original artwork that is immediately recognizable from the band&#8217;s album covers and posters, as well as numerous instruments used by the Grateful Dead over the years, and elements from the band&#8217;s legendary Wall of Sound PA system.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Grateful Dead is a band that is identified with a remarkable era in American history, and, inasmuch as they embody that era, their work is timeless,&#8221; noted Jim Henke, who began his career at <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine and is now Vice President of Exhibits and Curatorial Affairs for the Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve inspired many performers and bands, but none has exhibited their musical depth and cultural resonance. In a 30-year career, this group wrote their own rules and created a community unlike any band before or since.&#8221;&#8232;</p>
<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz Grateful Dead Archivist Nicholas Meriwether</strong> will attend the opening of the exhibition.<br/>
<br/>
As ambassador for the UCSC Grateful Dead archive, he has consulted with the museum during every phase of the creation of the exhibit--helping to place artifacts and stories in the larger context of the Grateful Dead&#8217;s history, and generally serving as a resource to the Hall&#8217;s curator and staff.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is the nation&#8217;s premier cultural repository for rock music,&#8221; Meriwether noted. &#8220;They are launching a major exhibition of the Grateful Dead and we&#8217;re honored to participate in the stewardship of the band&#8217;s legacy.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;This will be the first sustained, in-depth examination of the Dead phenomenon to be mounted on a national level,&#8221; added Meriwether. &#8220;It builds on the smaller exhibit put on by the New-York Historical Society last year, which gave the public a first look at the treasures of the Grateful Dead Archive at UCSC.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Now the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's exhibit will provide a more in-depth look at those treasures and those collected by the band members, close associates, and friends.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The exhibition will run through December 12.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Kramer said he has been working</strong> with staff on the Hall of Fame exhibition for almost 18 months. He noted the uniqueness of the Grateful Dead Archive at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The mere fact that an archive related to one specific and significant band exists is a major achievement,&#8221; said Kramer. &#8220;It&#8217;s unlikely that many of these sort of group-specific archives will exist because the material doesn&#8217;t exist.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;For the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, as well as our new Library and Archive, it&#8217;s important for institutions like ours to work together,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We have an annual visitorship&#160;between 450,000-500,000 and all will have the opportunity to see the exhibit.&#8221;<br/>

<p>Some 240 UCSC faculty and staff donated $48,000 to the United Way this year, earning the university a Gold Award in the process. The amount is impressive considering the current economic environment, said Anne Cawley, director of community giving and marketing for the United Way.</p>
<p>&#8220;The consistency of support from UCSC is so important to us,&#8221; Cawley said. &#8220;It is only with that consistency that we can really promise our programs that, yes, the money is coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>The United Way of Santa Cruz County raises and invests money from individuals and corporations to support a broad range of programs in the area. More than $1 million was collected this year.&#160;</p>
<p>Money raised will fund projects that touch nearly one out of three people in Santa Cruz County, Cawley said.&#160; Among them is a prescription drug discount program that generated more than $1 million in savings for over 10,000 low-income families last year and a Suicide Help Line which drew 4,000 calls, many of them from teens.&#160; In addition, 15 homeless families headed by women were given a roof over their heads; the women received training to help break the barriers that kept them and their families on the street.</p>
<p>In all, 40 health- and human-service programs are helped with funds from the United Way.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;These programs provide a safety net for people who are the most vulnerable in our community,&#8221; Cawley said.&#160; &#8220;Not just for people who are down and out, but for people who are trying to change their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you have a job in this economy, it feels good to be able to give back to those who are not so fortunate,&#8221; said Fiona Weigant, administrative assistant for the vice-chancellor for research.&#160; She was one of four people who headed UCSC&#8217;s United Way Drive on campus.</p>
<p>The award were presented at 11:30 a.m. March 29 at the Cocoanut Grove Sunroom.</p>
<p>Second Harvest Food Bank, which distributes 7.3 million pounds of food each year to working poor families, children and seniors, also honored UCSC for its contributions during an award celebration March 7 at the former Wrigley Building.&#160;</p>
<p>Campus faculty, staff and students provided 44,085 pounds of food during the holiday drive, according to John Steele, program analyst for Information Technology Services and chairperson of the Staff Advisory Board. Steele also was feted as one of two Coordinators of the Year.</p>
<p>Collection barrels, along with donation envelopes, were set out on campus. Student also could donate with FlexiDollars or from their meal plans. Steele said he was pleased with the 2011 drive, but planned to work to increase the amount of food donated during next year&#8217;s event.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="74f42b9c807270460175f79824a6ae59"><name>peregrine-falcons-hatch</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Peregrine falcon chicks hatch on San Francisco high-rise </title><summary>Four fluffy, white peregrine falcon chicks have hatched in a nest on the San Francisco skyline where they can be viewed via a web cam hosted by UCSC's Predatory Bird Research Group.</summary><keywords>uc, ucsc. uc santa cruz, social sciences, environmental studies, sustainability, peregrin falcons, glenn stewart, pge, santa cruz predatory bird research group</keywords><start-date>1333402200000</start-date><display-name>Peregrine falcons hatch </display-name><path>/2012/04/peregrine-falcons-hatch</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/peregrine-falcons-hatch</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1333402020681</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1333404168130</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/fluff-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/fluff-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fluff-250.jpg</name><display-name>fluff-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>80703</file-size><width>250</width><height>169</height></image><image-alt>peregrine falcon chicks</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/Lil et al-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/Lil et al-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Lil et al-80.jpg</name><display-name>Lil et al-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>26767</file-size><width>80</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>peregrine falcon with chicks </image-thumb-alt><image-caption>There are four peregrin falcon hatchlings (really) in this ball of fluff on the ledge of a San Francisco high-rise.

<br/>
The chicks, known as "eyases," began hatching Thursday, March 29 in a nesting box located on a ledge on the 33rd floor of PG&amp;E's headquarters at 77 Beale St., said SCPBRG director Glenn Stewart. The fourth and final egg hatched Saturday, March 31. <br/>
<br/>
The Predatory Bird Research Group, based at UCSC's Long Marine Lab, successfully reintroduced peregrine falcons to the wild after the species was nearly decimated 40 years ago from the effects of the pesticide DDT. The peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list on August 25, 1999.<br/>
<br/>
Stewart said PG&amp;E has partnered with SCPBRG for decades, including helping UCSC host the cameras that run live and continuously throughout the year.<br/>

The mother, known as "Diamond Lil," has begun to feed the young small bits of food. Web watchers can see the periodic feeding between stretches of the mom sitting on the chicks, keeping them warm. <br/>
<br/>
When the eyases are two to three weeks old, Stewart will go to the nest site to place identification bands on their legs. UC biologists are interested in the dispersal of falcon fledglings from natal areas to eventual nesting territories, the longevity of individuals, and tenacity of pairs at the nest site, he said. <br/>
<br/>
The PG&amp;E peregrine falcons have been a San Francisco financial district institution since the first falcon nest camera images appeared online. The falcons achieved a following from around the world including more than 300 schools and early on attracted more than one half million hits per week on the SCPBRG website.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
"PG&amp;E has been a terrific host to the birds since we established the first nest camera in 2005," Stewart said. In addition, PG&amp;E helps underwrite the conservation education assemblies that SCPBRG puts on for schools throughout Central and Northern California.<br/>
<br/>
Stewart said many volunteers in the falcon recovery project began as interested viewers. Some of the volunteers control the camera remotely, zooming in for a close-up or panning to show the San Francisco skyline when Lil leaves the nest to hunt. <br/>
<br/>
The young birds will be able to fly and fledge after 41 to 44 days when their flight feathers are grown in, Stewart said. <br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/nestcameras.htm</url><title>Falcon nest camera  at PG&amp;E headquarters</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/03/peregrine-falcons.html</url><title>Previous article on peregrin falcon hatch watch</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.scpbrg.org/</url><title>Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="75006682807270460175f798686b5992"><name>ucsc-in-the-news-4-2-12</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>The New York Times Green Blog wrote about research on mercury levels in coastal fog led by environmental toxicologist Peter Weiss-Penzias.&#13;

of the cosmos can now have at their fingertips the nearly 2,000 distant planetary systems discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission. Kepler Explorer, an innovative app for iPads and iPhones developed by a team at the University of California, Santa Cruz, provides interactive displays of newly discovered planetary systems based on Kepler data.</p>
<p>Now available for free from the iTunes <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kepler-explorer/id511676992?mt=8&amp;ls=1">App Store</a>, Kepler Explorer was developed through the <a href="http://openlabresearch.com/">OpenLab</a> initiative at UC Santa Cruz, which brought together faculty and students in astrophysics, art, and technology for a summer institute last year. The Kepler Explorer team includes astrophysicist Jonathan Fortney, a member of the Kepler science team; two of his graduate students, Eric Lopez and Caroline Morley; artist Kyle McKinley, a recent graduate of the Digital Arts and New Media program; and John Peters, a recent graduate of the computer game design program.</p>
<p>"I learned a lot about astrophysics from this project. It was a lot of fun," said Peters, who wrote all of the software code for the app.</p>
<p>Fortney, an associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, said he enjoyed the opportunity to work on a project that could reach a wider audience than most of his research. The team quickly settled on the idea to create an app, and also developed it into an exhibit that provides additional information and shows the app's output on a large screen. The exhibit was part of two OpenLab public exhibitions last year, one at the UCSC Digital Arts Research Center and another at the Tech Museum in San Jose. It is scheduled for long-term installation in the Lick Observatory visitors gallery later this month.</p>
<p>Kepler Explorer starts with drop-down menus listing all the Kepler-discovered planetary systems, plus our own solar system. The selected system is displayed in a view that shows the planet or planets in their orbits around the host star. Shown in real time the planets look motionless, but moving a slider increases the speed until the planets zip around their star. The touch screen lets users zoom in and move around the system, and tapping on an individual planet brings it up for further exploration. Another view shows the relative sizes of the individual planets compared to their host star.</p>
<p>Kepler Explorer's most innovative features are seen when viewing individual planets. The user can manipulate the composition of the planet and its atmosphere and see which mixtures of components (iron, rock, water, and hydrogen) are consistent with Kepler's observations. This feature represents graphically the type of in-depth analysis that Fortney does for the Kepler Mission. "I have pretty good intuition for what the likely composition of a planet is based on its size, but the app allows anyone to explore the properties of many different planets very quickly," he said.</p>
<p>Because Kepler detects planets as they pass in front of their host star, it only measures the radius of a planet, or how big it is. In most cases, the mass of the planet is unknown. When the mass is unconstrained, there may be different combinations of components that result in a planet of a given size. The app's interactive graphics show how this works. There are sliders for different components and how they are partitioned in the core and the atmosphere, and as you move the sliders the image of the planet grows and shrinks, based on hundreds of calculations. As you change the settings, the app tells you when the size of your planet matches the observations. The calculations involved took hours of computer time, but the results are stored in tables so the app can use them on the fly.</p>
<p>"For a large-radius planet, you can very quickly tell that it can't be a rocky planet, for example, and that in itself is pretty informative," Lopez said.</p>
<p>So far, the <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/">Kepler Mission</a> has detected a total of 2,321 planet candidates orbiting 1,790 host stars. Automatic updates for the Kepler Explorer app will add new planet candidates as they are discovered.</p>
<p>Jennifer Parker, an associate professor of art, started the OpenLab initiative in 2011 with astrophysicist Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, who invited Fortney to participate, and recent graduates Amy Boewer and Jack O'Neill. "We wanted to bring together faculty who are interested in interdisciplinary work with students from a range of disciplines," Parker said. "There is such a vast amount of research on this campus, and one way to share it with the public is to make tangible things and playable media. It's not just about art illustrating science. OpenLab is creating a space for new ways of thinking that can emerge from conversations between different disciplines."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7a3ccd3a8072704601747681f9428953"><name>sab-nominations</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Join the Staff Advisory Board</title><summary>Joining the Staff Advisory Board is an excellent opportunity for you to get involved with your campus and community.</summary><keywords>SAB</keywords><start-date>1333440000000</start-date><display-name>Join the Staff Advisory Board</display-name><path>/2012/04/sab-nominations</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/sab-nominations</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1333490666721</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1333490666721</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><small><small><span>Joining the Staff Advisory Board is an excellent opportunity for you to get involved with your campus and community. Becoming an SAB member can put you face to face with campus and system wide leaders who can help you better understand staff policies and how to effect positive change for staff on a campus and system wide level.</span></small></small></p>
<p><small><small><span>Getting involved with the SAB will also provide you with many avenues for you to pursue community building efforts, both on the campus and in the greater Santa Cruz community.&#160; The SAB is proud to participate in efforts such as the, United Way, Second Harvest Holiday Food Drive, Transportation Advisory Committee, Student Fee Advisory Committee, Advocacy, Diversity and much more. &#160;The SAB believes in leading by example.<br/>
</span></small></small></p>
<p><small><small><span>The SAB is also honored to host the Chancellor's Staff Forums and the annual staff picnic. We also coordinate and administer the peer to peer Thumbs Up award each year, as well as working together with the Alumni Association to present the annual Outstanding Staff member award.</span></small></small></p>
<p><small><small><span>SAB also participates with UC system wide. Two Board members from each campus are sent to quarterly meetings of the Council of UC Staff Assemblies (CUCSA) where staff issues are shared and discussed. The Staff Advisors to the Regents are almost always present for CUCSA gatherings. Proposals from the CUCSA delegation are then put forward to UCOP and the Regents.&#160;In this way CUCSA and the local Staff Assemblies have been responsible for some of the most major changes to affect all of Staff across the whole of UC.</span></small></small></p>
<p><small><small><span>We sincerely hope that you will consider taking this opportunity to represent your fellow staff members, learn more about staff issues and get involved in some very meaningful community building efforts.</span></small></small></p>

<p class="p1">On Friday evening, April 27, we're going to attend a performance of <a href="http://www.centralsquaretheater.org/season/11-12/remembering-hm.html"><span class="s1">Yesterday Happened: Remembering H.M.</span></a> (90 minutes, no intermission) at the <a href="http://www.centralsquaretheater.org/index.html"><span class="s1">Central Square Theatre</span></a> in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>About the play:</b> <i>At the age of 27, Henry Molaison became frozen in time. After experimental brain surgery, H.M. was unable to form new memories. His personal tragedy became neuroscience's golden opportunity, contributing more to our understanding of the brain than had been learned in the previous 100 years. A scientific detective story, Yesterday Happened: Remembering H.M. explores the mysteries of his moving story, expanding on them and helping us understand ourselves. This World Premiere is being created in conversation between scientists who studied H.M. and artists: playwright Wesley Savick, composer Tod Machover, and designer Justin Townsend.</i></p>
<p class="p1">After the performance,&#160; <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/%7Etod/"><span class="s1">Tod Machover</span></a>,&#160; Composer, UCSC (Porter College) alum and Playright/Director Wes Savick will talk about "Adapting HM's Story for the Stage" in a post-show conversation with the audience.</p>
<p class="p1">Tod's "work over the past 30 years demonstrates an extraordinary range and diversity that enhances our definition of music itself and our conception of what it can achieve. Called "America's Most Wired Composer" by The Los Angeles Times, Machover is widely recognized as one of the most significant and innovative composers of his generation, and is also celebrated for inventing new technologies for music, including Hypersinstruments which he launched at the MIT Media Lab in 1986."--todmachover.com</p>
<p class="p1">And last but not least, we'll head over next door to the trendy new Pan-Asian restaurant, <a href="http://moksarestaurant.com/"><span class="s1">Moksa, </span></a>for drinks and more conversation with Tod.</p>
<p class="p1">Don't miss this wonderful and unique opportunity to see a fascinating play, with music composed by your fellow alum, Tod Machover.&#160; Participate in post-performance conversation with the director and composer, and go out for drinks next door for a great time.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>WHAT:</b>&#160; Yesterday Happened: Remembering H.M.<br/><b>WHERE: </b>Central Square Theatre, Cambridge, Mass.<br/><b>WHEN:</b> Friday, April 27, 8 p.m. (performance) - 10:15 drinks at Moksa<br/><b>COST: Groups 10+<br/></b>Adult: $35<br/>Senior: $30<br/>Student: $20<br/>Under 18: $15</p>

<br/>
The event featured more than 50 community artists who work with fire and light-- with exhibits ranging from glowing art installations to interactive dance and video performances, to cutting-edge pyrotechnic arts.<br/>
<br/>
Drew Detweiler, a 2010 graduate of UCSC&#8217;s Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) M.F.A. program, organized the digital arts portion of the program.</p>
<p>He currently works on campus as a research associate for DANM.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, it&#8217;s important to take what we do on campus and get it out into the community&#8212;to share our work,&#8221; said Detweiler. &#8220;The Santa Cruz community is really interested in technology.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Detweiler was one of</strong> several UCSC alums and students who participated in the GLOW festivities.<br/>
<br/>
He worked on two dance performances&#8212;for the first, he created a live video mix of dancers wearing&#160; electro-luminescent wires, projected onto a giant screen, and set to music by UCSC professor Karlton Hester.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
For the second performance, Detweiler projected video onto dancers wearing Isis wings&#8212;giant translucent butterfly-like wings that reflect light.<br/>
<br/>
Other contributions by DANM students and alums included an audio/video installation of glowing projections on the museum floor that were triggered by attendees who walked over them, as well as an LED-lighted sculpture hanging in the circular staircase that reacted to sounds in the gallery space.</p>
<p>There was also clothing adorned with an array of LED lights that reacted to the ambient noise of the room.</p>
<p>Plus, an interactive video installation with projection-mapped images on a 3-D cubed surface that users were able to interact with through the Kinect game interface--allowing them to control video on the cube through their own gestures in the air.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Detweiler has kept busy since graduating</strong> from the DANM program, organizing exhibitions of digital art, and working on a variety of different projects.<br/>
<br/>
This past summer, he attended UCSC&#8217;s Open Lab Summer Institute: &#8220;Art + Astrophysics,&#8221; where he designed a Wii-triggered game called &#8220;Galactic Bowling&#8221;&#8212;trying to demonstrate the improbability of a star&#8217;s orbit coming close to a black hole.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I worked with (professor) Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz and his Astrophysics students and our DANM students,&#8221; said Detweiler. &#8220;We made the game frustrating and challenging to give the sense of how improbable this event is. It&#8217;s a way of teaching using visualization.&#8221;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
<strong>Detweiler added that he is currently working</strong> with UCSC professors Karlton Hester (music), Ted Warburton (theater arts-dance), and, Greg Laughlin (astrophysics), to develop a dance piece based on the classic physics Three-Body Problem.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s interpreting an astrophysics visualization through dance and music,&#8221; explained Detweiler. &#8220;We&#8217;re presenting a scientific visualization on stage through video, dance, and lighted costumes.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
A non-traditional student, Detweiler enrolled in UCSC&#8217;s DANM program after spending eight years working as the head of post-production at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts.<br/>
<br/>
He&#8217;s glad he did.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;DANM was everything I hoped it would be,&#8221; Detweiler noted. &#8220;It gave me the time, space, and resources I needed to create new work and update my skill set to the current technology. And through the connections of faculty, I&#8217;ve been able to get my work out into the larger Bay Area community,&#8221; he added.&#160;<br/>

The ParkCard is a debit card that can be used at all campus parking meters and paystations, eliminating the need for change, and reducing transaction times at paystations. UCSC ParkCards cost $5 for the refillable card, and are pre-loaded with a value of $20. ParkCards do not have an expiration date; more time can be easily added at campus parking paystations by using a Visa or MasterCard, or at the TAPS Sales Office during business hours.<br/>
<br/>
 An added benefit of ParkCards is the ability to obtain credit for unused time at meters; simply insert the card into the meter before leaving the parking space. (This refund option is not available at campus paystations.)<br/>
<br/>
 ParkCards are not refundable, but are transferable. The initial purchaser may make their own transaction to sell or gift their ParkCard to another individual when they no longer need it.<br/>

Selberg died peacefully last month at his home in Ashland, Oregon. Dracott and Headley were two of the many students on campus who learned fencing (and many other things) from the revered master.</strong></p>
<p>Charles Alan Palmer Selberg passed away in good humor at home on 9 March 2012 at the age of 81 after a brief battle with lung cancer. He was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota on 2 August 1930. He is survived by wife, Julie, and brother, Wallace.</p>
<p>Sign painter, cartoonist and artist, Selberg moved to California in 1952 where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts and a Master of Fine of Arts from San Francisco State University. He was a student of renowned photographer, John Gutman, and taught art in San Francisco.&#160; After falling in love with fencing in the early 1950&#8217;s, He returned to Fargo, North Dakota to start the Selberg Fencing Academy in 1960.</p>
<p>He returned to San Francisco in 1966 where he taught fencing at Halberstadt Fencer&#8217;s club, and began his 16-year career teaching fencing at University of California at Santa Cruz (where he was a tenured member of the eminent faculty of Cowell College). Known affectionately as &#8216;Mr Natural&#8217; amongst fencers at UC Santa Cruz, due to his engaging approach to teaching fencing, he was revered for his keen psychological and strategic insights into the game. His ability to teach quality fencing to large groups of students was a tribute to his deep knowledge of the sport, creative ability and tremendous sense of humour.</p>
<p>Selberg received his Maitre D&#8217;Armes in 1967 from the Federation International D&#8217;Escrime. The Fencing Masters that taught Charles created his most impressive fencing lineage: German born Eric Funke, followed by American born Jack Nottingham (taught by Aldo Nadi), and Hungarian born Olympic champion George Pillar (taught by Laszlo Borsody and Italo Santelli). His years working with Hans Halberstadt also left a profound impression on teaching as well as endless stories.</p>
<p>In 1970 he was a member of the three-man foil team that won the only gold medal ever for US at the World Masters Championships.</p>
<p>Named one of the <a href="http://www.acfencers.com/fencingmasters.html">Great Fencing Masters in History</a> by Amarillo College in Texas, Charles was the author of renowned books Foil (1976) and Revised Foil (1993). After retiring UCSC in 1982, he moved to Ashland, Oregon where he resumed the <a href="http://www.selbergfencing.com">Selberg Fencing Academy</a> and created an extensive series of instructional videos and DVDs. His direct knowledge of West Coast fencing history was phenomenal and, happily, much of that history has been saved on video and on his Salle walls in Oregon.</p>
<p>During his retirement he also recommenced painting in his art studio amongst the red cedars he loved so much. An abstract, post-impressionist painter, he has a painting in the permanent collection at Moorhead State University, Minnesota, and one also at North Dakota University. And on the side of the McCormick building in Fargo, is a restored version of the infamous sign painting of &#8216;The Cowboy&#8217; that Selberg painted in 1949 (commissioned by Sunny Brook Whiskey).</p>
<p>He will be missed dearly by Julie, Mark, Angela, his many friends and the thousands of fencers that he has taught. &#160;Hanta Yo! A great man has passed.</p>
<p>Charles had a particular fondness for gorillas, and donations in his honor to be made to <a href="http://www.defenders.org/">Defenders of Wildlife</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/04/07/MNSELBERGC040745.DTL</url><title>San Francisco Gate obituary</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="97c1aeb780727046009719cbed25ec61"><name>arboretum-sale</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Arboretum holds annual Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, April 21</title><summary>Since 1977, the Arboretum's plant sales have been providing gardeners with colorful and unusual plants for creating dynamic central coast gardens.</summary><keywords>UCSC Arboretum, UC Santa Cruz Arboretum, spring plant sale</keywords><start-date>1333958400000</start-date><display-name>Arboretum Spring Plant Sale</display-name><path>/2012/04/arboretum-sale</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/arboretum-sale</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1333985914414</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1386211126270</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/sarracenia-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/sarracenia-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sarracenia-375.jpg</name><display-name>sarracenia-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>124976</file-size><width>375</width><height>563</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/sarracenia-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/sarracenia-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sarracenia-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sarracenia-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>28417</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p>Plants featured at the Arboretum Spring Plant Sale include the carnivorous bog plants <em>Sarracenia</em> (above) and the succulent <em>Conophytum</em> (below), which is one of the easier stone plants to grow and is brilliant when in flower.

<p>Since 1977, the Arboretum has been providing gardeners with colorful and unusual plants for creating dynamic central coast gardens. Many of the selections available at the sale are normally hard to find. This year's spring sale will feature some of the newest treasures from the UCSC Arboretum.</p>
<p>The Arboretum's sale is held in conjunction with the spring plant sale of the California Native Plant Society (CNPS). Both sales are open early (from 10 a.m. to noon) to members of the Arboretum Associates and CNPS, and to the general public from noon to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Among the Arboretum's offerings this year are plants that may be unfamiliar because they are new introductions, but their names are likely to be well-known to gardeners 15 years from now, said Stephen McCabe, director of development and research at the Arboretum. Examples include <em>Boronia heterophylla,</em> with its subtle fragrance and beautiful pink blossoms, <em>Grevillea</em> 'Mason's Hybrid', and many other grevilleas, leucadendrons, proteas, and California native plants. Succulents, which have become fashionable lately, will be well represented, in addition to some <em>Sarracenia</em> hybrids, which are carnivorous bog plants.</p>
<p>A complete list of the plants available at the sale will be posted on the Arboretum's <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu/">web site</a>. At the sale, cut flowers taped to the plant signs will show what the flowers will look like. The Arboretum will pay the sales tax on all plant sales and will also be conducting drawings for free plants. Drawings for several plants will take place every hour from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. (members only for the special 11 a.m. drawing). You must be present to win.</p>
<p>The influence of the Arboretum&#8217;s founding director, the late Ray Collett, can be seen in the diversity of plants available at the sale. Luen Miller of the Monterey Bay Nursery wrote that under Collett's direction, the Arboretum "certainly made more worthwhile, lasting introductions to our trade than any other institution in the U.S., possibly in the world."</p>
<p>On Sunday, April 15, Rick Flores, curator of the Arboretum's Native Plant Collection, will lead a Native Plant walk at 10 a.m. at the Arboretum Entrance, offering a preview of some of the plants that will be for sale the following weekend. Both the Arboretum and the CNPS will have a flowery mix of native plants for sale. Most of the natives are drought tolerant, but some of the CNPS offerings are canyon or riparian plants that can use some supplemental water in summer. As usual, the Arboretum will be offering a range of unusual exotics, including some new ones. The Arboretum's non-native plants are screened to be noninvasive. The two sales present a colorful display of options to spice up your garden for spring.</p>
<p>For more information, contact the UCSC Arboretum at (831) 427-2998 or visit arboretum.ucsc.edu. The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="97edfa7680727046009719cb58c78684"><name>jfast-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC scientist reports stormy start to JFAST expedition</title><summary>Typhoon-strength winds and 30-foot waves greeted the JFAST expedition off the coast of Japan on April 4.</summary><keywords>Emily Brodsky, Casey Moore, seismology, IODP, JFAST, Tohoku earthquake</keywords><start-date>1333958400000</start-date><display-name>Stormy start to JFAST expedition</display-name><path>/2012/04/jfast-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/jfast-update</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1333988817428</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1333988914417</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/chikyu-storm.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/chikyu-storm.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chikyu-storm.jpg</name><display-name>chikyu-storm.jpg</display-name><file-size>75639</file-size><width>300</width><height>258</height></image><image-alt>satellite image of storm</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/chikyu-storm-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/chikyu-storm-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chikyu-storm-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>chikyu-storm-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19836</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>satellite image of storm</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>This satellite image shows the extent of the storm encountered by the JFAST expedition.

<p>The JFAST expedition aims to drill into the fault that caused the devastating Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 (see <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/03/jfast-expedition.html">earlier story</a>). Casey Moore, research professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC, is also on board the <em>Chikyu</em>. Emily Brodsky, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, helped organize the expedition.</p>
<p>Kirkpatrick and other members of the expedition are posting regular updates on the <a href="http://www.jamstec.go.jp/chikyu/exp343/e/index.html">JFAST web site</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="98bc12d680727046009719cbc80a7707"><name>anne-callahan-outstanding-staff-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Anne Callahan wins 2012 Alumni Association Outstanding Staff Award</title><summary>Anne Callahan, academic human resources manager for the Humanities Division, is this year’s recipient of the UCSC Alumni Association Outstanding Staff Award, honoring employees who go above and beyond.</summary><start-date>1333958400000</start-date><display-name>Outstanding Staff Award winner Anne Callahan</display-name><path>/2012/04/anne-callahan-outstanding-staff-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/anne-callahan-outstanding-staff-award</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1334002324101</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1334003565517</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/annecallahan.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/annecallahan.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>annecallahan.jpg</name><display-name>annecallahan.jpg</display-name><file-size>37419</file-size><width>350</width><height>243</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/annecallahanthumbnail801.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/annecallahanthumbnail801.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>annecallahanthumbnail801.jpg</name><display-name>annecallahanthumbnail80.jpg</display-name><file-size>14732</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p>Anne Callahan's colleagues praise her fair-mindedness, problem-solving skills and "astute understanding of people." (photo by Carolyn Lagatutta)</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Honor recognizes Callahan's longstanding professionalism, work ethic and positive attitude on campus</article-subhead><article-text><p><strong>&#160;</strong>In 1977, Anne Callahan showed up on her first day of work at UCSC dressed as a ballerina. That might sound like a risky gambit. Fortunately it was Halloween.</p>
<p>"I brought my regular clothes in a bag in case I needed them,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The only thing is, I didn&#8217;t recognize anyone on my second day of work because everyone was all dressed up."</p>
<p>It seems fitting that Callahan, who went completely incognito on that first day of work, is now getting so much public recognition.</p>
<p>Currently the academic human resources manager for the Humanities Division, Callahan is this year&#8217;s recipient of the UCSC Alumni Association Outstanding Staff Award, honoring employees who go "above and beyond" to help students or colleagues, improve programs and contribute to the university&#8217;s intellectual and physical environment.</p>
<p>Callahan provides direct support to the dean of the humanities for several important tasks: hiring faculty, supporting them, and assessing their progress over time. She said she is&#160; &#8220;completely surprised&#8221; by the honor. &#8220;I just do my job. I do have a good attitude&#8212;I&#8217;m a &#8216;glass is half-full&#8217; person. Still it was really out of the blue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her day-to-day responsibilities mostly fall into the category of "cradle to grave services" for humanities faculty, she said. "I especially interact with faculty and academic appointees. We bring them here, we handle their appointments, their leaves, their reviews. We work out their retirements."</p>
<p>Callahan has a deep understanding of process on campus, in part because she has held a job that she enjoys for a large chunk of UCSC&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>"I know who to call, how to move things through quickly and respectfully. A lot of it is knowing how hard to push and when to back off. I&#8217;m also a networker. I try to hook people up to resources available both here and off campus."</p>
<p>Humanities Dean William Ladusaw said Callahan has a very good sense of how faculty members&#8217; careers have developed. &#8220;Because of that experience, she is probably one of the people on campus who has the best advice on how to develop faculty potential as well as it can be developed. The way she does this is scrupulously fair, helpful, and supportive to whatever dean she is working with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ladusaw also described her as having a &#8220;cheerful, sunny disposition. She&#8217;s resilient.&#8221;</p>
<p>But her enthusiasm combines with a scrupulous professionalism, according to colleagues who recommended her. They also described her deep knowledge of process and negotiating bureaucracies.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;Anne Callahan is the person responsible for bringing so many outstanding faculty to the Humanities Division,&#8221; said Donna Mekis, who serves on the Alumni Council, which chose Callahan for the award. Mekis is also part of the award selection committee.</p>
<p>"She has an extensive knowledge of the university and its regulations, is a problem-solver, and does impeccable work for the campus,&#8221; Mekis continued. &#8220;Anne is fair-minded, always demonstrates good judgment, and has an astute understanding of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Callahan has connections to the area and the university that go beyond her job. A native of Salinas, she&#8217;s a lifelong local. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a little cowgirl in me,&#8221; she said. Her daughter, Julia Rose Callahan, (Porter, &#8217;05, literature and history) is a proud Slug, who is now working as director of marketing and publicity for Rare Bird Literature in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Her husband is a local fixture, Bill &#8220;Bill the Oysterman&#8221; Callahan, well known for his briny bivalves, which he serves up as part of his catering business. He is also a science teacher at Watsonville High School.</p>
<p>Callahan has an A.B. in Political Science from UC Berkeley. She&#160; is so devoted to the particulars of public administration that she earned her masters degree in that field from San Jose State University while working at UCSC and attending night classes. "It took me seven years," she said.&#160;</p>
<p>She can often be seen on campus hiking through the open space areas with her hair flying in the wind. On weekends you will often find her revisiting a Jane Austen book, reading contemporary fiction, or losing herself in presidential biographies.</p>
<p>Callahan is in distinguished company as an Outstanding Staff Award winner. Previous honorees include: Michael McCawley, director of admissions (2011); Rosie Cabrera, director of the Ethnic Resource Center (2010) and Joe Weiss, technology director of the Theater Arts Department (2009).</p>

campus, documents and illustrates the research theme of UCSC's anthropology department.&#160; Each anthropology faculty member has selected a single item encountered and salvaged during their research. Accompanying the item is a 200-world explanation of how it figures in an emerging world.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
The exhibition is open to the public through May 5. A campus opening reception is set for Wednesday, April 11 from 3:30-5 p.m. The gallery is on the second floor of the Porter Faculty Gallery at Porter College and is open Tuesdays through Saturdays from noon to 5 p.m. and Wednesdays from noon to 8 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
Anthropology at UCSC looks at how worlds come into being, whether thousands of years ago or in the present. Researchers seek to uncover and understand new civilizations and societies that are emerging from the dynamic changes in global transportation, immigration, communication, and political organization.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
For instance, Professor Anna Tsing has selected a discarded cigarette pack from Cambodia that she found in an Oregon forest. At the time, Tsing was following Southeast Asian American mushroom hunters from California who harvest the matsutake mushroom, a prized delicacy in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
"I picked it up, because it opened up a world for me," Tsing recalled. "I was learning with an object and navigating around a strange place." Tsing said that when she ran across the cigarette pack for a second time she knew she was no longer lost in the forest "because the pack showed me the way."<br/>
<br/>
Department chair Danilyn Rutherford chose a broken compass from her studies in Papua New Guinea. The compass resembles one that belonged to a Dutch patrol officer who was surprised that he also required traditional native methods of navigation.<br/>
<br/>
Other items include a 1,900-year-old bone with evidence of metal tool use submitted by professor Diane Gifford-Gonzalez, and a traffic barrier, selected by assistant professor Mayanthi Fernando. The barriers are erected each Friday to facilitate street prayer by hundreds of Arab and African men unable to fit inside two Paris mosques, Fernando explains.<br/>
<br/>
The exhibition brings together the department's cultural anthropologists as well as archaeologists, Rutherford said. "It got us all in conversation about what we do."<br/>
<br/>
Rutherford joined UCSC two years ago from the University of Chicago to lead the anthropology department. She brought with her the emerging world theme.&#160; "Emerging worlds are happening all the time," she explains.&#160;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Tsing brought the exhibition idea back with her from the University of Copenhagen where she spent some time as part of a Guggenheim Fellowship to further her mushroom-gathering research. The Waterworlds research group there had organized an exhibit to document their research into climate change. One researcher submitted a life jacket from Sri Lanka to discuss the effects of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.<br/>
<br/>
Undergraduates in the departments of art, history of art and visual culture, and film and digital media helped curate, design, and make the exhibits, and are documenting it.<br/>

<br/>
Over countless cups of coffee, the two hatched a plan for Grahm&#8217;s Bonny Doon Vineyard to develop specially bottled wines with custom-designed labels by UCSC art students.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the proceeds from these wines would go to supporting UCSC arts scholarships.<br/>
<br/>
A call soon went out to UCSC art students to submit design ideas for the first vintage.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I really wanted a student to design the label,&#8221; recalled Dean Yager. &#8220;We had the three finalists visit Randall to help inspire their designs.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Art major Louise Leong</strong> created the winning image for the 2010 Banana Slug Roussanne white wine. She is also a staff illustrator for the campus&#8217; student newspaper, <em>City on a Hill Press</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Leong&#8217;s brightly-colored label includes images of honey bees, plus the winemaker&#8217;s signature red Citroen automobile.<br/>
<br/>
The official launch of the new wine is April 30. To celebrate the release, the Bonny Doon tasting room will host an exhibition of original artwork by all three of the runner-up UCSC student artists.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The partnership with Grahm</strong> is just one of the many efforts Dean Yager has made since his arrival in 2009 to reconnect the UCSC Arts Division with alumni, the local, and the not-so-local community.<br/>
<br/>
His efforts appear to be paying off.<br/>
<br/>
Last summer the campus hosted a Film and TV symposium, bringing in Kevin Beggs, a UCSC alumnus who is president of <strong>Lionsgate Television Group</strong> as keynote speaker.<br/>
<br/>
Guest panelists included a bevy of UCSC alums who are now major players in the entertainment industry.<br/>
<br/>
Yager followed that up in the fall with a fundraising evening held in Los Angeles for UCSC alums in film and TV, hosted by Brannon Braga (<strong>Star Trek, 24, Terra Nova</strong>) that was a big success.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Braga is also a membe</strong>r of the new Arts Dean&#8217;s Leadership Board that Yager has created.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Other participants on the advisory board include director Sheldon Epps (<strong>George Lopez, Frasier, Friends</strong>), producer Ron Yerxa (<strong>Little Children, Little Miss Sunshine</strong>), Rhino Films CEO Steve Nemeth, executive producer Brian Kavanaugh-Jones (<strong>Take Shelter, Insidious</strong>), and Kikim Media CEO Kiki Kapany.&#8232;</p>
<p>At the LA event, the dean presented award-winning writer and producer Marti Noxon (<strong>Mad Men, Grey&#8217;s Anatomy, Glee</strong>) with the first <em>UCSC Film &amp; Digital Media Prestigious Alumni Award</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, Noxon said she came away with &#8220;a renewed desire to support the Arts Division at UCSC,&#8221; and has since collaborated with the dean on fundraising outreach to film and TV alumni.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Yager also encouraged the LA group</strong> to think about supporting vital new initiatives for the UCSC Arts Division that he characterized as "game changers"--including a named School of the Arts, the University Museum of the Arts and Sciences, and a new film building.<br/>
<br/>
The dean said he is currently about to begin advertising to hire a director for the museum, to enhance planning and fundraising efforts.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Conceived as an &#8216;institute of curiosity,&#8217; this museum will invite viewers to explore objects, images and ideas from across the disciplines,&#8221; said Yager.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;More than a museum, it will operate as an intellectual hub for visiting faculty, UCSC faculty, and artists in residence, and will provide space for everything from site-specific installations and experiments in scientific visualization, to seminars, events, and hands-on research,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>An <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/lectures/dean-lecture-series-2012" title="Arts Dean's Lecture Series">Arts Dean&#8217;s Lecture Series</a></strong> titled &#8220;Reshaping the Museum&#8221; will kick off at UCSC on April 12 to help the campus begin thinking about the project. Featuring eight free public lectures, it will bring in guest speakers to talk about the concept of a museum from a wide variety of different perspectives.<br/>
<br/>
This marks the second installment of the annual dean&#8217;s lecture series that Yager began in 2011. Last spring&#8217;s speakers focused on the topic of &#8220;Creativity and Innovation.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dean Yager observed</strong> that he is finding UCSC arts alumni eager to reconnect with the campus and excited about participating in the future of the Arts Division.<br/>
<br/>
As Randall Grahm noted last week at his restaurant <em>Le Cigare Volant</em> (formally the Cellar Door) on the West Side of Santa Cruz: &#8221;I&#8217;m an alumnus and have enormous affection and affinity for UCSC&#8212;which formed my personality and interests.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I have a debt to the campus,&#8221; Grahm added. &#8220;The whole ethos of Bonny Doon Vineyard could not have existed without UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;<br/>

<br/>
"Salmon are an essential resource that propagates through not only marine but also creek and terrestrial food webs," said Taal Levi, a UCSC environmental studies Ph.D. candidate specializing in conservation biology and wildlife ecology.<br/>
<br/>
In "<a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001303">Using Grizzly Bears to Assess Harvest-Ecosystem Tradeoffs in Salmon Fisheries</a>," published today (April 10) online in the journal <em>PLoS&#160; Biology</em>, Levi and co-authors, including Chris Darimont, a UCSC postdoctoral researcher in environmental studies, Chris Wilmers, UCSC assistant professor of environmental studies, and Marc Mangel, UCSC professor of applied mathematics, investigate how increasing "escapement" &#8211; the number of salmon that escape fishing nets to enter and spawn in streams &#8211; can improve the natural environment. Darimont and two other coauthors are also members of the Raincoast Conservation Foundation in British Columbia.<br/>
<br/>
Levi and co-authors focused on the relationship between grizzlies and salmon.&#160; Grizzlies make an ideal research subject to determine how different levels of salmon harvest can affect the ecosystem, Levi said. He and his colleagues first used data to find a relationship between how much salmon were available to 18 grizzly bear populations in British Columbia and what percentage of their diet was comprised of salmon.<br/>
<br/>
The relationship between salmon and bears is basic: "Bears are salmon-consuming machines," Levi said. &#8220;Give them more salmon and they will consume more &#8211; and importantly, they will occur at higher densities.&#160; So, by letting more salmon spawn and be available to bears helps not only bears but also the ecosystems they nourish when they distribute the uneaten remains of salmon.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
When salmon are plentiful in coastal streams, bears thrive and produce more cubs, as many as four. Additionally, given surplus salmon, bears won't eat as much of an individual fish, preferring the nutrient-rich brains and eggs and casting aside the remainder to feed other animals and scavengers and fertilize the land.<br/>
<br/>
When salmon are scarce, bears produce fewer cubs, if any, and eat more of a fish. Less discarded salmon enters the surrounding ecosystem to enrich downstream life.&#160; Richer stream life in turn means a better environment for salmon.<br/>
<br/>
Levi and his co-authors argue that, in four out of six study systems, allowing more salmon to spawn will not only help bears and the terrestrial landscape but would also mean more salmon in the ocean. More salmon in the ocean means larger harvests, benefiting fishers.<br/>
<br/>
In the two systems in which helping bears would hurt fisheries, the researchers estimated the potential financial cost. They looked at two salmon runs on the Fraser River, B.C., and predicted an economic cost of about $500,000 to $700,000 annually. This cost to the human economy could help support locally threatened or extirpated grizzly bear populations, they argue.<br/>
<br/>
While these fisheries are certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), the researchers suggest that the MSC principle that fisheries have minimal ecosystem impact might not be satisfied if the fishery is contributing to grizzly bear conservation problems.<br/>
<br/>
&#160;Salmon fisheries in the northwest Pacific are generally well managed, Levi said. Managers determine how much salmon to allocate to spawning and how much to harvest.&#160; Fish are literally counted as they enter the coastal streams. However, there is concern that humans are harvesting too many salmon and leaving too little for the ecosystem.<br/>
<br/>
"We asked, is it enough for the ecosystem? What would happen if you increase escapement?&#160; We found that in most cases, bears, fishers, and ecosystems would mutually benefit," Levi said.<br/>
<br/>
He and the other researchers believe the same analysis can be used to evaluate fisheries around the world and help managers make more informed decisions to balance economic and ecological outcomes.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a31631a58072704601e40bbe1274c5e6"><name>galloway-talk</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Let's talk--Open office hours this Friday</title><summary>Alison Galloway, campus provost and executive vice chancellor, invites students to her open office hours this Friday, April 13, from 3 to 4:30 p.m. in Quarry Plaza.</summary><keywords>galloway, office hours, students, FSH, family student housing, talk</keywords><start-date>1334131200000</start-date><display-name>galloway-talk</display-name><path>/2012/04/galloway-talk</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/galloway-talk</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1334176002316</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1334176281613</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Welcome to spring quarter. I hope the time between finals and the first day of classes was restful and restorative.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
I want to make sure you know that I'll be hosting open office hours in Quarry Plaza this Friday afternoon from 3 to 4:30. This is an informal opportunity for you to stop by, ask questions, and let me know what's on your mind.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
One topic that's come to my attention recently is Family Student Housing. For those of you who can't make it on Friday, let me clarify a few things in the wake of some misinformation that's circulating around campus. <br/>
<br/>
Family Student Housing (FSH) is a vital part of our campus infrastructure, and UCSC's commitment to housing families and couples is unwavering. However, our current FSH units are nearing the end of their structural life. While some might argue that we try to extend their useful existence through remodeling and renovation, at some point the investment in repairs exceeds the value of the units. When that happens, it is best to replace the units with the needs of today&#8217;s families, energy efficiency, accessibility and community spaces in mind.&#160; The campus is in the very early stages of developing a long-term plan to do so.<br/>
<br/>
As always, the cost of new housing is funded as part of our campuswide housing program. When we built apartments, for example, at Cowell, Stevenson, and Porter Colleges several years ago, the students who subsequently moved in did not foot the bill alone for those new buildings. Similarly, when the debt for older campus housing is retired, the entire housing program &#8212; and the residents who support it &#8212; benefits. Keeping future rate increases as low as possible will be a top priority as we discuss the renewal of housing for student families. <br/>
<br/>
There are many other topics to discuss on Friday, including UC's ongoing budget challenges and their impacts on you. In the end, my conversations with students make me a better advocate for you. If you can't make it on Friday, please share your thoughts by writing me at cpevc@ucsc.edu.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much for your time. <br/>

<br/>
Siagatonu received the award April 5 in Washington D.C. Last fall, the White House launched its &#8220;What&#8217;s your story?&#8221; video challenge to highlight the personal stories of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders across the country who have had an effect on their communities. Siagatonu's successful video, &#8220;When We Speak for Ourselves,&#8221; on her work in Los Angeles, was one of more than 200 videos and 35 essays submitted.<br/>
<br/>
Siagatonu is a spoken word artist, arts educator, and community organizer from the Bay Area. She is currently project director for PIER: the Pacific Islander Education and Retention project at UCLA, a project to combat low matriculation rates of Pacific Islander students into higher education. It offers free tutoring, mentorship, and peer advising to Pacific Islander high school students in Los Angeles.<br/>
<br/>
She has worked as a poet mentor with Youth Speaks, the leading nonprofit organization for spoken word performance and literary arts education in the country, as well as with grassroots groups such as One Love Oceania, a queer Pacific Islander women&#8217;s organization from the Bay Area, the Samoan Community Development Center of San Francisco, Empowering Pacific Islander Communities of Los Angeles, and Engaging Education at UCSC.<br/>
<br/>
The Champions of Change program was created as a part of President Obama&#8217;s Winning the Future initiative. Each week, a different sector is highlighted and groups of "champions," ranging from educators to entrepreneurs to community leaders, are recognized for the work they do to serve and strengthen their communities</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> http://collegeten.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/whitehouse.html</url><title>College Ten article and link to the winning video</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/siagatonu-terisa-216.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/siagatonu-terisa-216.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>siagatonu-terisa-216.jpg</name><display-name>siagatonu-terisa-216.jpg</display-name><file-size>39358</file-size><width>216</width><height>90</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Terisa Tinei Siagatonu</thumb-alt><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a3a046238072704601e40bbe1d17543c"><name>ray-film-screening</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>India film star to appear at screenings hosted by UCSC’s Satyajit Ray Film Center</title><summary>Actress and filmmaker Aparna Sen to speak at UCSC Media Theater (April 21) and Nickelodeon Theater (April 22)</summary><keywords>satyajit ray film and study center, satyajit ray, Ray FASC, uc santa cruz, ucsc, Indian cinema, Indian films, tagore, ucsc history department</keywords><start-date>1334186700000</start-date><display-name>India film star hosted by UCSC’s Satyajit Ray Center</display-name><path>/2012/04/ray-film-screening</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/ray-film-screening</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1334185051572</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1335216329956</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/Aparnan-Sen-325.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/Aparnan-Sen-325.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Aparnan-Sen-325.jpg</name><display-name>Aparnan-Sen-325.jpg</display-name><file-size>44828</file-size><width>325</width><height>359</height></image><image-alt>Aparna Sen</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/ray-sen--thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/ray-sen--thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ray-sen--thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ray-sen--thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19922</file-size><width>81</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Aparna Sen</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Aparna Sen</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Actress and filmmaker Aparna Sen to speak at UCSC Media Theater (April 21) and Nickelodeon Theater (April 22).</article-subhead><article-text><p><strong>Aparna Sen,</strong> one of India&#8217;s most eminent film stars and filmmakers, will be the guest of honor at two Santa Cruz film screenings hosted by UCSC&#8217;s <a href="http://satyajitray.ucsc.edu/" title="Satyajit Ray Film and Study Center (Ray FASC)">Satyajit Ray Film &amp; Study Center (Ray FASC)</a>, April 21 and 22.<br/>
<br/>
The acclaimed actress, scriptwriter, and director is the winner of three India National Film Awards, as well as eight international film festival awards.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>On April 21</strong>, Sen will appear at a screening of the Satyajit Ray film <em>Samapti</em>, beginning at 5 p.m. in the Media Theater on the UCSC campus.<br/>
<br/>
She made her acting debut in that 1961 film at the age of 16, and has played roles in three other Satyajit Ray film classics.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Samapti</em> is based on a short story by Bengali philosopher, poet, and Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore.</p>
<p>The film was recently restored by The Academy Film Archives in Los Angeles.<br/>
<br/>
Following the screening, Sen will speak about the Tagore cultural and literary heritage and field questions from the audience.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>On April 22</strong>, Sen&#8217;s recent film <em>The Japanese Wife</em>--a long distance romantic drama--will be screened at the Nickelodeon in downtown Santa Cruz, followed by a Q&amp;A session with the director.<br/>
<br/>
Sen made her directorial debut with the film <em>36 Chowringhee Lane</em> in 1981. She has since directed nearly a dozen films, including the award-winning <em>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Iyer</em> (2002), and <em>Paroma</em> (1985), a landmark feminist film.<br/>
<br/>
Sen has also appeared in Merchant-Ivory&#8217;s <em>Guru</em> and <em>Bombay Talkie</em>, and a number of other English language films.<br/>
<br/>
Admission to the April 21 event at UCSC&#8217;s Media Theater is free. The April 22 screening at Nickelodeon will be ticketed at the usual price.<br/>

<br/>
Psychology professor emeritus Elliot Aronson has been selected winner of the 2012 Distinguished Social Sciences Emeriti Faculty award.<br/>
<br/>
Palca and Aronson will be honored in separate events at the end of April as part of UCSC's Alumni Reunion Weekend.&#160; Palca will receive the alumni award Thursday, April 26 at a reception and presentation from 4-6 p.m. in the Las Feliz Room of the Seymour Discovery Center at Long Marine Lab,<br/>
<br/>
The next day, Friday April 27, Aronson will be guest of honor at a luncheon and presentation from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., also in the Las Feliz Room.<br/>
<br/>
The distinguished emeriti award honors eminent scholars, researchers, and instructors who continue to make major contributions in their fields since retirement. Aronson taught at UCSC from 1974 to 1994 and is one of the preeminent social psychologists of the 20th century. He has written or edited more than 20 books including <em>The Social Animal</em>, <em>The Jigsaw Classroom, Nobody Left to Hate, Mistakes Were Made, (but not by me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts</em>, and last year, a memoir N<em>ot By Chance Alone: My Life as a Social Psychologist.</em><br/>
<br/>
After retirement, Aronson continued to teach and write, publishing five books. "It is difficult to imagine anyone who has accomplished more in his field: not only during his regular tenure, but as an emeritus professor,'' wrote professor David Swanger in his nomination letter.<br/>
<br/>
"I love doing research in social psychology so it is not surprising that I continued to do it long after my so called "retirement," Aronson said. During the past 15 years, he said, his major activity has been to "translate this research into jargon-free books for non-psychologists--to demonstrate the wide variety of ways in which a knowledge of social psychology can help us understand the everyday happenings of our world, such things as prejudice, bullying, empathy, and compassion."</p>
<p>The distinguished alumni award recognizes graduates in the social sciences who have made extraordinary accomplishments in their careers. After UCSC, Palca first worked as a health producer for the Washington, D.C. CBS affiliate. He later was a science journalist for Nature and a senior correspondent for Science. He joined NPR in 1992.<br/>
<br/>
His research at UCSC was in human sleep physiology.</p>
<p>In nominating Palca, psychology professor Bruce Bridgeman wrote that his reports "are valued because he has a knack for getting to the bottom of a story, reporting<br/>
the facts and their meaning for the public without having an axe to grind.<br/>
<br/>
"Ironically, it is his own solid scientific background, acquired at UC Santa Cruz, that enables him to accomplish this with so much success," Bridgeman wrote.<br/>
<br/>

<p>It will be a gathering "to celebrate Ray and his beloved Arboretum with friends, students, and colleagues," said current Arboretum director Brett Hall.</p>
<p>Collett, a professor emeritus of natural history, died February 22 at the age of 79. He taught courses in a wide variety of disciplines and worked with students, donors, volunteers, and staff to create a well-loved botanical garden at UC Santa Cruz. Collett introduced many new plants to horticulture in the United States and received awards for his work from the American Horticultural Society and the California Horticultural Society.</p>
<p>The Arboretum has also planned a series of occasional lectures in memory of Collett. The first of the Ray Collett Rare and Extraordinary Plants Lectures will be held at the Arboretum on Tuesday, April 17, at 7 p.m., preceded by a 6 p.m. potluck. The talk, "Survivors from an Ancient World: The Extraordinary Flora of New Caledonia," by Chad Husby of the Montgomery Botanical Center, will touch on some of the Arboretum's New Caledonian plants. New Caledonia is an archipelago long separated geographically from other land masses in the southern Pacific. Collett collected or arranged for the collection of many of the Arboretum's New Caledonian plants.</p>

<p>Leanos is one of a diverse group of 181 artists, scientists, and scholars selected this year by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation from a group of 3,000 applicants.</p>
<p>Guggenheim Fellows are appointed on the basis of distinguished achievement in the past and exceptional promise for future accomplishment.</p>
<p>The program considers applications in a wide variety of fields, ranging from the natural sciences to the creative arts.</p>
<p><strong>Lea&#241;os is an interdisciplinary artist</strong> in UCSC&#8217;s Social Documentation program who works in animation, installation, and performance.<br/>
<br/>
Lea&#241;os said the Fellowship will support his production of a series of musical documentary animations about the makings of the Southwest Borderlands called <em>Frontera!</em><br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The work takes a 'Schoolhouse Rock!' approach to documentary, using popular music and cartoons to tell under-recognized stories of the contested US-Mexico borderlands from Latina/o and Indigenous perspectives,&#8221; Lea&#241;os noted.<br/>
<br/>
He added that the award will also allow him to continue building a sustainable independent animation collective in Santa Cruz and the San Francisco Bay Area.<br/>
<br/>
That collective not only trains and mentors aspiring media artists enabled by new technologies, but also focuses on the telling of alternative stories that enhance understanding of racial diversity and border politics with a historical context.&#160;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lea&#241;os noted that the fellowship</strong> will also support his teaching and his efforts to build a &#8220;Documentary Animation&#8221; curriculum in UCSC&#8217;s Film and Digital Media Department and Social Documentation M.A. program.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Documentary Animation is an established but re-emerging genre proliferating with access to new technologies, coupled with the desire to tell critical stories not represented in media.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;This year I taught the first Documentary Animation critical studies and production courses at UCSC,&#8221; Lea&#241;os added.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;With the help of the Guggenheim Fellowship, I hope to build on these courses to train a new generation of informed, conscious and skilled documentary animators from UCSC.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lea&#241;os' animated films have been shown</strong> internationally at festivals including the Sundance Film Festival, the Mill Valley Film Festival, and Cannes Short Corner 07.<br/>
<br/>
His installation work has been exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art&#8217;s 2002 Whitney Biennial, Art in General in New York City, the Oakland Museum, and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.<br/>
<br/>
Lea&#241;os' multimedia Mariachi opera, <em>Imperial Silence: Una &#211;pera Muerta / A Dead Opera in Four Acts</em> has also been staged at venues including the Museo del Barrio in New York; and The Luckman Fine Arts Center in Los Angeles.<br/>

<p>Soares has been working with theoretical astrophysicist Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz on a study of the remnants of exploding stars. She has also done research with physicist David Williams, using data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the VERITAS telescope array to study high-energy gamma-ray emissions.</p>
<p>"I've been fortunate to be able to do both theoretical and experimental projects," Soares said. "When you become immersed in the research community, you learn things you would never pick up in a class, just from getting to know the scientists, talking over coffee, and managing a project. The day-to-day work is quite different from one project to another, so I appreciate the opportunity to experience several projects first-hand."</p>
<p>The first in her family to go to college, Soares grew up on a dairy farm in Gilroy. She started at Gavilan College in Gilroy, where she excelled, before transferring to UC Santa Cruz. Malika Bell, director of STEM Diversity Programs at UCSC, encouraged Soares to pursue undergraduate research opportunities. "She was confident that I was ready to begin a research project at a point in my education when I still felt rather intimidated," Soares said.&#160;</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz, an associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics, said Soares is an excellent student who has successfully managed the competing demands of coursework, research, and family life. A single mother when she started at UCSC, she now has two children, ages six and one, and a partner who works in San Francisco. Ramirez-Ruiz said her story is inspiring. "Despite all her other competing demands, her dedication to science and the quality of her work are largely unmatched by even the most dedicated and brightest physics students at UCSC."</p>
<p>Soares credits her family and the supportive environment at UC Santa Cruz. "Being a parent has never been an issue at UCSC. The environment here is inclusive, welcoming, and encouraging. From day one I felt that people wanted to work with me and were willing to teach me the skills necessary to move the project forward," she said.</p>
<p>Soares won first place honors for an oral presentation of her work on supernova remnants at the 2012 <a href="http://www.emerging-researchers.org/">Emerging Researchers National Conference</a>, held in Atlanta in February and hosted by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). This project involved looking at the morphology of supernova remnants, the debris left over from an exploding star, and using features of the remnant to determine what the original star's properties were and what type of explosion took place.</p>
<p>At an American Physical Society (APS) meeting in November, Soares earned second place honors for the Steven Chu Award for Best Research by an Undergraduate. At that conference, she presented her research with Williams on a class of supermassive black holes called blazars, which are among the most energetic objects in the universe.</p>
<p>While Ramirez-Ruiz and Williams both provided valuable guidance on these research projects, Soares has also worked closely with graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. Amy Furniss, a physics graduate student in the Williams lab, worked with her on the VERITAS study of high-energy gamma-ray emissions. On the supernova remnant project, she worked with Laura Lopez, who earned her Ph.D. in astrophysics working with Ramirez-Ruiz and is now an Einstein Fellow at MIT. "Both of them have been great mentors. Without their help I couldn't have accomplished as much," Soares said.</p>
<p>She is now starting a new project with Ramirez-Ruiz and graduate student Jill Naiman, using computer simulations to investigate globular clusters, spherical concentrations of stars tightly bound by gravity. Soares said she plans to continue working on this project after she graduates in June, and she will be applying to graduate schools in the fall.</p>
<p>Michael Dine, professor of physics and chair of the department, said students who graduate with research experience are better prepared not only for graduate school but for working in the private sector and for facing real-world challenges in general. "It's a maturing experience for them, and they come out with valuable skills," he said. "For any student who wants to do research, the opportunities are available. We have a lot of undergraduates who are not only doing research, but publishing their research and presenting it at conferences."</p>
<p>For Soares, the insights she's gained from her research experience include discovering what she likes to do and realizing that she is already a scientist herself. "I'm fascinated by science," she said. "There are so many intriguing projects I could see myself doing."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/melinda-soares_2-216.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/melinda-soares_2-216.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>melinda-soares_2-216.jpg</name><display-name>melinda-soares_2-216.jpg</display-name><file-size>36390</file-size><width>216</width><height>90</height></thumb><thumb-alt>melinda soares</thumb-alt><title>Melinda Soares</title><description>Senior physics major Melinda Soares has won honors for her research presentations at two conferences in the past year.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c13fee95807270460082496eca726e98"><name>young-am-acad</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Physicist Peter Young elected to American Academy of Arts and Sciences</title><summary>Peter Young, distinguished professor of physics, has been elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, one of the nation's most prestigious honorary societies.</summary><keywords>Peter Young, American Academy of Arts and Sciences</keywords><start-date>1334682000000</start-date><display-name>Peter Young </display-name><path>/2012/04/young-am-acad</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/young-am-acad</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1334682054187</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1334779170947</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/peter-young-150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/peter-young-150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>peter-young-150.jpg</name><display-name>peter-young-150.jpg</display-name><file-size>52175</file-size><width>150</width><height>192</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/peter-young-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/peter-young-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>peter-young-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>peter-young-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21446</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Peter Young</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Peter Young, distinguished professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, has been elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, one of the nation's most prestigious honorary societies.</p>
<p>Young joins 25 other current UCSC faculty members who are fellows of the academy. The 220 new members elected to the academy this year are accomplished leaders from academia, business, public affairs, the humanities, and the arts. They include U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Amazon founder Jeffrey Bezos, journalist Judy Woodruff, actor Clint Eastwood, and playwright Neil Simon. The 2012 class will be inducted at a ceremony on October 6 at the academy's headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Young is known for his pioneering research in theoretical condensed-matter physics. &#160;A major focus of his research involves numerical studies of phase transitions in disordered magnetic systems called spin glasses. Spin glasses are used as experimental platforms for research because they can be probed precisely with magnetic fields, and because they are relatively simple to simulate. The properties of these unusual materials change when they undergo phase transitions, analogous to the transition of liquid water to ice. Young studies these transitions, including their effects in superconducting materials. His work in spin glasses provides a foundation for solving many similar problems in other fields, such as protein folding in biology and optimization problems in computer science. Recently Young has been applying techniques from the spin glass field to investigate what kinds of problems could be solved efficiently by a quantum computer.</p>
<p>Young earned his M.A. and D.Phil. in physics from Oxford University. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1985 and has been honored by UCSC with the 2003 Excellence in Teaching Award and by the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences with its 2004-2005 Outstanding Faculty Award. A fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), he was awarded the APS Aneesur Rahman Prize in 2009. Young received a Humboldt Research Award earlier this year.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 1780, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences has elected leading "thinkers and doers" from each generation, including George Washington and Benjamin Franklin in the eighteenth century, Daniel Webster and Ralph Waldo Emerson in the nineteenth, and Albert Einstein and Winston Churchill in the twentieth. The current membership includes more than 250 Nobel laureates and more than 60 Pulitzer Prize winners.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c19b98b2807270460082496e72496bcb"><name>blake-rothman-oakes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Oakes College founding faculty trace UCSC's roots in upcoming forum</title><summary>Herman Blake,founding provost of Oakes College, and his old friend and UCSC senior lecturer emeritus in writing Don Rothman, will discuss the enduring values of UCSC and the history of Oakes during Alumni Reunion Week.</summary><keywords>rothman, oakes, herman blake</keywords><start-date>1334649600000</start-date><display-name>Blake and Rothman dialogue: UCSC Alumni Reunion 2012</display-name><path>/2012/04/blake-rothman-oakes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/blake-rothman-oakes</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1334688061529</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1334697868812</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/blake-alumni-weekend2012.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/blake-alumni-weekend2012.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>blake-alumni-weekend2012.jpg</name><display-name>blake-alumni-weekend2012.jpg</display-name><file-size>21720</file-size><width>180</width><height>162</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/blake-alumni-weekend80thumb1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/blake-alumni-weekend80thumb1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>blake-alumni-weekend80thumb1.jpg</name><display-name>blake-alumni-weekend80thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14895</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Founding Oakes provost Herman Blake returns to campus to discuss the enduring values of UCSC and the history of Oakes, now entering its 40th year.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/rothman_180-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/rothman_180-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rothman_180-1.jpg</name><display-name>rothman_180-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>8235</file-size><width>180</width><height>125</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Senior emeritus writing faculty member Don Rothman, Herman Blake's old friend and colleague, will take part in a far-ranging dialogue during UCSC's Alumni Reunion Weekend.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Candid discussion scheduled for Friday, April 27, from 7:30 to 9:00 p.m. in the Humanities Lecture Hall as part of Alumni Reunion Weekend</article-subhead><article-text><p>When UCSC admitted its first class in 1965, the country was going through a period of social and political foment.</p>
<p>Idealistic young students were drawn to a university whose founding values were deeply rooted in liberal education across the disciplines &#8212; what some called a &#8220;grand experiment&#8221; taking shape in the redwood-studded hills of the former Cowell Ranch property.</p>
<p>As a someone who recalls those early days of UCSC, J. Herman Blake&#8212;founding provost of Oakes College, and currently humanities scholar in residence at the Medical University of South Carolina&#8212;is well qualified to talk about the transformative power of education during periods of social, political and economic change.</p>
<p>Soon, he and his old friend and former colleague Don Rothman, UCSC senior lecturer emeritus in writing, will have a chance to share some of those historical lessons and enduring stories during their upcoming discussion and forum scheduled for Friday, April 27, from 7:30 to 9:00 p.m. in the Humanities Lecture Hall.</p>
<p>Their talk will delve deeply into the founding values of UCSC, the growth of its colleges, and the challenge faced by today&#8217;s educators: In the current climate, how can they work to bridge economic and social divides, reinforce the links between the humanities and hard sciences, and encourage students to embrace socially conscious careers?</p>
<p>This candid discussion will appeal to anyone interested in UCSC&#8217;s history and lasting relevance.&#160; And the two of them will have plenty of stories about Oakes, which exemplifies the groundbreaking, cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary spirit of the young UCSC.</p>
<p>&#160;Still vital and still going strong, Oakes turns 40 this year.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;One thing hasn&#8217;t changed,&#8221; Rothman said. &#8220;If you attend an Oakes commencement, sit up on the stage and look out at the crowd, look at the families and their faces, you will understand what is at stake here. You&#8217;ll see the look on the faces of parents who are there for the first kid in their family to graduate from college.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake was on campus when the college that would become Oakes was taking shape. He vividly remembers dialogues with students who rallied for an all African-American college in 1968. His suggested alternative was a college that focused on ethnic studies while reaching out to African-Americans, Asian Americans, Chicanos and Native Americans as well as European immigrants.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;I said, &#8216;when you get to the table, after you were not permitted to sit at the table in the past, don&#8217;t just rejoice because you&#8217;re at the table,&#8217;&#8221; Blake said. &#8216;Ask yourself who is not here, and think about those who are now in the positions you once were, and think about ways in which you can bring them in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Access to science education was also a longstanding part of Oakes culture and remains so to this day. Rothman said Oakes&#8217; founders and early faculty were very much aware that students of color and working-class students did not have much of a presence in medical schools or science engineering programs. They were determined to increase that presence, and strongly encourage these students to explore science careers.</p>
<p>The Oakes science community has had a lasting impact on campus.&#160; For instance, UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal, a distinguished astrophysicist, was a founding Oakes faculty member. William T. Doyle, initial director of the Institute of Marine Sciences, was a founding faculty member and deputy and acting provost of Oakes College.</p>
<p>In the early days, people often spoke of Oakes College as an "experiment"&#8212;but experiments tend to be short-lived, while Oakes continues to thrive, Blake said.</p>
<p>&#8220;To us the concept experiment meant &#8216;expedient&#8217;, something assumed to be temporary and expendable,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;However, the values and principles upon which we built Oakes were and still are rooted in age-old values of American society&#8212;with an emphasis upon the inclusive and uplifting elements rather than the elitist and exclusive elements. Unbeknownst to many of us, we added African, Latino, Native American,&#160;Asian and European values we&#160;neither knew nor understood at the time&#8212;but they were within us and we shared them.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>He compared the history of Oakes and UCSC to &#8220;a living&#160;tapestry still being woven.&#160; In many ways Oakes College&#160;invites students&#160;with diverse roots to understand their lives and incorporate their roots into that tapestry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rothman and Blake will be on hand to discuss the intellectual, academic and personal history of this influential and still-vital college.

<br/>
The phenomenon, known as glacial lake outburst floods, is caused when glaciers melt, forming high-altitude lakes that either overwhelm or collapse their shores inundating&#160; downstream villages and farmland. The floods have historically occurred in Nepal and other glacial areas.<br/>
<br/>
The researchers are part of the newly formed Global Glacial Lake Partnership and worked with Himalayan residents, an unprecedented alliance.&#160; A detailed article on the expedition can be found on the <a href="http://envs.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/buryfrench-everest-apr2012.html">Environmental Studies news site</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The scientists traveled to Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park and Kathmandu, Nepal, for the "2011 Andean-Asian Glacial Lake Expedition." Their mission was to understand and mitigate the effects of global climate change on high-altitude communities and environments.<br/>
<br/>
Bury has done extensive research in the Peruvian Andes where techniques have been developed over the past several decades to mitigate the potential dangers from fast-forming glacial lakes.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://envs.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/index.html</url><title>Environmental Studies news page</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://people.ucsc.edu/~jbury/</url><title>Jeff Bury's research page</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c1e6e319807270460082496eda4817e5"><name>admits-fall-2012</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC's fall class is increasingly selective and includes more first-generation students</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has offered admission to 60.5 percent of high school seniors who applied for the fall 2012 quarter, a prospective class that includes more California residents and a higher number of students who would be the first in their family to earn a four-year degree. </summary><start-date>1334692800000</start-date><display-name>Fall 2012 admissions</display-name><path>/2012/04/admits-fall-2012</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/admits-fall-2012</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1334692995764</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1335561641917</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/100-slug-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/100-slug-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>100-slug-80.jpg</name><display-name>100-slug-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>29460</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has offered admission to 60.5 percent of high school seniors who applied for the fall 2012 quarter, a prospective class that includes more California residents and a higher number of students who would be the first in their family to earn a four-year degree.<br/>
<br/>
<a href=" http://www.ucop.edu/news/studstaff.html">Numbers released today</a> (April 17) by the University of California&#8217;s Office of the President show UCSC offered admission to 19,936 applicants of the record 32,954 high school seniors who applied for a freshman spot. Of those, 44.8 percent would be the first in their family to graduate from a four-year university, the highest total ever for the UCSC campus. It represents an increase over 40.4 percent in fall 2011, and 36.1 percent in 2010.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Each year we&#8217;ve become increasingly selective but continue to admit excellent students who reflect the diverse population of our state,&#8221; said Michael McCawley, UCSC&#8217;s director of admissions. A year ago, UC Santa Cruz offered admission to 19,074 freshmen applicants for an admission rate of 67.9 percent.<br/>
<br/>
UCSC became more selective while offering admission to more California high school seniors (18,265) than a year ago (17,917), reflecting the campus&#8217;s continued commitment to provide a place for qualified state residents who wish to attend.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s gratifying that we continue to provide access and opportunity for our California students who work so hard to pursue a UC degree,&#8221; McCawley said.<br/>
<br/>
UCSC plans to enroll 3,700 new freshmen for fall 2012, a number that will keep overall undergraduate enrollment the same as the 2011-2012 academic year.<br/>
<br/>
UC Santa Cruz also increased the number of admission offers to out-of-state and international students. Admission offers increased 862 (4.5 percent) over fall 2011. Included were offers to 348 additional California residents, 306 more out of state, and 208 more international.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Seeing increased interest in our campus from students from other states and around the world underscores the recognition that UCSC is gaining as a world-class research university,&#8221;&#160; McCawley said.<br/>
<br/>
As in past years, UCSC also continued to admit higher percentages of students from low-income families (39.4 percent) compared with 34.8 percent in 2011, and under-performing high schools (27.2 percent) compared with 22.5 percent in 2011.<br/>
<br/>
UCSC admitted more California freshmen from underrepresented ethnic groups. Chicanos and Latinos account for 5,201 (28.5 percent) of admitted students, up from 4,570 (25.5 percent) in 2011, and 3,484 (20.8 percent) in 2010. The number of African Americans increased to 682 (3.7 percent) this year, up from 569 (3.2 percent) last year.<br/>
<br/>
The expected ethnic composition of the 2012 fall class would move UCSC closer to qualifying as a Hispanic Serving Institution in which 25 percent of students are of Hispanic origin, a campus goal. It would make UCSC eligible for incentives to boost retention and graduation rates and provide recognition for the long-standing efforts to more closely reflect the ethnic composition of California.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It is particularly gratifying to see the diversity of this year&#8217;s admitted frosh,&#8221; McCawley said, &#8220;especially the gains in underrepresented and underserved students. Our entire campus community &#8211; faculty, staff, students, and alums &#8211; are committed to make UCSC accessible to a broad range of deserving students.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The University of California adjusted its admission policy this year to cast a broader net to admit and enroll students with strengths that go beyond high grades and test scores.&#160; In addition, UCSC adopted a new selection process similar to other UC campuses for fall 2012. The new &#8220;holistic review&#8221; continued to take into account a wide range of academic and non-academic achievements in the context of the opportunities available to each applicant.<br/>
<br/>
Admitted freshmen&#160; have until May 1 to accept their admission offer.</p>

</span></div>
<span><br/>
</span> 
<div><span>Throughout the year UCSC Police, faculty, students, and staff partner in creative ways to prevent violence and substance abuse &#8212; so that UCSC students can feel safer and better able to enjoy and complete their university careers. To do so requires fair and firm enforcement and education that enables individuals to make safer, smarter choices.<br/>
</span></div>
<span><br/>
</span> 
<div><span>The Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse and Violence Prevention advises that alcohol is a "situational contributor to sexual violence" and, along with other drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, Rohypnol, heroin, hallucinogens, etc. may be "used to facilitate rape."&#160;Click on the&#160;<a href="http://swc.osu.edu/posts/documents/sexual-violence-and-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-on-campus.pdf">Sexual&#160;Violence and Alcohol and Other Drug Use on Campus</a>&#160;article.</span></div>
<span><br/>
</span> 
<div><span>During April, the UCSC Police Department along with other Santa Cruz agencies will be participating in enforcement efforts directed at violators of alcohol and other drug policies and statutes on and near campus, including drivers under the influence.<br/>
</span></div>
<span><br/>
</span> 
<div><span><strong>Safety Reminders:</strong><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; Friends are safer when they stay together, especially in settings where alcohol and other drugs (AOD) are present. Be vigilant, especially in crowds. &#160;Alcohol and other drug use can increase the risk for sexual assault.<br/>
</span></div>
<span><br/>
</span> 
<div><span>&#8226; Resist abuse &#8211; Alcohol and drug use can impair your health, personal development and the ability to achieve your goals.<br/>
</span></div>
<span><br/>
</span> 
<div><span>&#8226; It is illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs.<br/>
</span></div>
<span><br/>
</span> 
<div><span>&#8226; Driving under the influence of marijuana increases the risk of accidents and fatal collisions, according to a recent meta-study (British Medical Journal, published February 9, 2012).<br/>
</span></div>
<span><br/>
</span> 
<div><span>&#8226; It is a violation of UCSC policy and CA State law to possess, use, dispense or sell controlled substances on university properties.<br/>
</span></div>
<span><br/>
</span> 
<div><span>&#8226; Respect the rights of others.<br/>
</span></div>
<span><br/>
</span> 
<div><span>&#8226; An increasing number of students enter UCSC as non-drinkers (national trend) and more than 60% of UC Undergraduates do not use marijuana (2010-11 CA Safer Universities Study, quarterly prevalence). It&#8217;s OK to choose not to use.<br/>

<strong>Report all in-progress crimes by calling 9-1-1. Anyone&#160;with information about these crimes is encouraged to call the UC Santa Cruz&#160;Police Department at&#160;831-459-2231.

<strong>Safety Reminders:</strong></span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; Always be alert to your surroundings. Be&#160;aware of suspicious activity &#8212; and please don't hesitate to&#160;immediately alert the UC Santa Cruz Police Department of such&#160;activity. If you are ever in doubt, it is&#160;always better to&#160;ask authorities to investigate, rather than risking potential harm to you&#160;or someone else.</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; All bicycles used, stored, parked or operated on the UC Santa Cruz&#160;campus must be licensed with a valid California bicycle license that are&#160;available from TAPS.<br/>
&#8226; Always make sure to lock your bike, even if you&#8217;re only leaving it&#160;for &#8220;just a minute.&#8221;<br/>
&#8226; Whenever possible, always lock your bike to a fixed, but legal&#160;device such as a bike rack or pod.<br/>
&#8226; Lock up your bike in a highly visible and well-lighted location,&#160;and in a designated bicycle parking area whenever possible.<br/>
&#8226; U-shaped high security locks are among the most theft-resistant&#160;locks available. However, be aware that they are still easily defeated by&#160;knowledgeable thieves. Accessories for U-locks are available that&#160;reduce the&#160;effectiveness of leveraging devices used by many bike thieves.<br/>
&#8226; Heavy-duty chains with case-hardened, 5/16&#8221; thick links are more&#160;secure than cables.<br/>
&#8226; Quick release wheels and seats can be secured with a cable, chain&#160;or security devices and are available at bike shops.<br/>
&#8226; It is smart to use a less valuable bike or older bike for running&#160;errands and commuting on UC Santa Cruz and in the City of Santa Cruz.<br/>
&#8226; Save any&#160;evidence. Do not remove any evidence until officers are able to respond&#160;and investigate.<br/>

<br/>
Because of this expected activity, UC Santa Cruz Police department asks that you&#160;anticipate&#160;transportation and other&#160;disruptions, especially on the west side, and&#160;encourages that you plan accordingly. University Police will be in the area to address public safety needs, coordinate traffic management, and provide emergency response if needed.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>To assist the&#160;Police Department in keeping the UCSC Community safe, everyone is encouraged to&#160;consider the following:<br/>
</strong><br/>
&#8226;&#160;Please remember that all members and guests of the UC&#160;Santa Cruz community are expected to comply with University policy, federal,&#160;and state law.<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; Parking anywhere on campus and adjacent to campus may be&#160;difficult that afternoon.&#160;Campus&#160;parking regulations will be strictly enforced.&#160;Sections of Empire Grade will be&#160;designated as a tow-away&#160;zone, and vehicles will be ticketed and towed at owners' expense.<br/>
<br/>
</span> 
<div><span>&#8226;&#160;As a safety reminder, be prepared, plan alternate&#160;commute routes, and &#8212; because of traffic delays &#8212; please build in extra time&#160;for transit.&#160;Traffic and transit&#160;flow is expected to be&#160;highly impacted throughout the campus, especially along&#160;Empire Grade, and on Heller Drive from the West Entrance to McLaughlin Drive.&#160;Traffic diversion measures may be instituted if&#160;needed to alleviate impacted&#160;areas.&#160;If driving a vehicle,&#160;be alert for increased pedestrian traffic on all roadways.<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; Because this activity attracts people who are&#160;unaffiliated with the campus, please make an extra effort to be aware of suspicious&#160;activity &#8212; and please don't hesitate to immediately&#160;alert the UC Santa Cruz&#160;Police Department of such activity.&#160;If you are ever in doubt, it is always better to ask&#160;authorities to investigate, rather than risking potential harm to you or&#160;someone else.<br/>
<br/>
&#8226;&#160;Those who live and work in the areas around Family&#160;Student Housing, Porter College and College Eight are advised that, as in past&#160;years, smoke may remain in the area throughout&#160;the late afternoon.&#160;Those with children, respiratory&#160;problems, or other medical conditions should use precautions.<br/>
<br/>
&#8226;&#160;Please respect the rights of others.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for&#160;your understanding and cooperation.<br/>

(Photo courtesy of Neal Rogers)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Graduates find success on the racing circuit and in the industry</article-subhead><article-text><p>Like most professional cyclists, Brooke Miller relied on a combination of training, determination and skill to get her to the winner&#8217;s podium.</p>
<p>But Miller also had an unlikely trick up her jersey sleeve when it came to racing: a 2007 Ph.D. in evolutionary biology from UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;In behavioral ecology we studied a lot of game theory,&#8221; said Miller, now 36. Game theory is the study of strategic decision-making where the outcome of a participant&#8217;s action depends on the actions of other contestants.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole time I was racing I would be thinking: What is my image score? What do other riders think about me?&#8221; Miller said.&#160; That strategic way of thinking in a sport that combines teamwork with individual sprints, landed her on the TIBCO professional bike racing team and won her a string of top finishes, including a 2008 national championship in both road and criterium (a circuit course) events.</p>
<p>But Miller, who started racing for the Cycling Club at UCSC and is now&#160; retired from the sport, isn&#8217;t the only one whose bicycling career got a boost while studying at UCSC.</p>
<p>The campus is both bike-conscientious and eco-friendly&#8212;despite a killer climb from town to class. Twisting mountain roads and beautiful single-track trails lie nearby, while a culture of healthy and sustainable transportation permeates the campus. It&#8217;s no coincidence, then, that the university boasts strong participation in annual Bike to Work Week festivities and that a number of Slugs have gone on to make careers out of their biking obsessions.</p>
<p><strong>Twin wheelmen</strong></p>
<p>Twins Ben Jacques-Maynes (Cowell, &#8217;03, environmental studies and economics) and Andy Jacques-Maynes (Crown, &#8217;00, economics), for instance, are both professional bike riders who came out of UCSC. So is Julian Martinez (Cowell, &#8217;10 environmental studies) who rides for the Fremont Bank Cycling Team.&#160;</p>
<p>Neal Rogers (Cowell, &#8217;95, anthropology and American literature) is editor in chief of Velo magazine and Sean Holman (Cowell, &#8217;99, business management/economics) founded a cycling business that includes an upcoming fund-raising race, which combines his passion for bicycling with his interest in sustainability and green energy. Others have gone on to work as bike team mechanics, product designers, and cycling advocates, while 45 students are currently registered on the UCSC Cycling Club teams.</p>
<p>Among two-wheeled travelers are staff, students, and faculty who use the UCSC Bike Shuttle (an average of 221 per day during the fall quarter of 2011) or who simply huff their way up the hill. The campus also draws countless community members who use sanctioned trails and roads for recreation or training.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s a little cycling mecca,&#8221; said Skippy Givens, UCSC&#8217;s intramural and sports club advisor, of the campus and its environs.</p>
<p><strong>Magic in the hills</strong></p>
<p>For Velo magazine&#8217;s Rogers, 39, UCSC was a magical place where &#8220;when you got to campus you were literally next to world-class single track.&#8221;</p>
<p>He evolved from a party-loving student when he arrived at UCSC to an outdoors-loving surfer who wore bike shoes to class so he could hit the trails between lectures.&#160; It was a passion that led him to an internship at Velo and eventually to the top spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t gone to school in Santa Cruz, I might not be sitting in this chair,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the proximity to technical trails and pulse-raising roads that makes the campus a draw for adventurous riders, including the pro-cycling Jacques-Maynes twins.</p>
<p>Andy, 33, used the twisting Wilder Ranch trails to de-stress between his part-time job and classes. He went on to race professionally, then work as a product manager for Specialized, one of the world&#8217;s largest bike companies, before he returned to his first love, racing.&#160; He recently won the prestigious San Dimas Stage Race, riding for the Kenda/5-Hour Energy team.</p>
<p>His brother, Ben, who rides for Bissell, the No. 1-ranked cycling team in the nation, said it was his time at UCSC, racing with friends, that reignited his love of the sport. May 14, he will be returning to his old training grounds up Bonny Doon and Empire Grade roads when he takes part in the renowned Tour of California.</p>
<p>Holman, 38, founder of the bike venture Velo Cruz, managed to combine his love of cycling with a passion for the environment, both sparked by his time at UCSC.&#160; Now director of business development for the wind-energy firm, Talco, he not only formed Velo Cruz to host cycling tours and training camps but also started a fund-raising event he hopes will become a Santa Cruz tradition.</p>
<p>The 56-mile ride, called The Green Fondo, will raise money for five community non-profits including Save Our Shores and Ecology Action, and will be followed by a three-course slow-food dinner.&#160; The race is set for April 29 (<a href="http://greenfondo.com">greenfondo.com</a>).</p>
<p><strong>A training ground</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new crop of riders populates the campus.&#160; The UCSC Cycling Club has 45 official members who race at varying levels in the Western Collegiate Cycling Conference, in road, mountain bike and cyclocross events.</p>
<p>Some like Nick Newcomb and Will Curtis, (both Stevenson &#8217;14, human biology) place regularly in the top 10 in the competitive Category A level.&#160; Curtis won the conference mountain biking championship this season and Newcomb is headed to the nationals in road racing.&#160;</p>
<p>Others come out simply for the camaraderie and race at more novice levels.&#160; The culture of riding is so ingrained, there is even an unofficial, off-campus &#8220;Bike House&#8221; which, for the past six or seven years, has been populated exclusively by Cycling Club members.</p>
<p>&#160;And while faculty, staff and students at flat campuses like UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara regularly ride to class and work, the estimated 500-600 bike commuters who visit the UCSC campus every day should be given their due.</p>
<p>Some brave the 600-foot elevation climb from town to Science Hill while others use the free UCSC Bike Shuttle up the hill then ride back down home.&#160; Deb Collins, administrative analyst in the audit department, has used both methods.</p>
<p>For her, cycling around the UCSC campus offers an experience flatlanders might not find.&#160; She regularly spots bobcats, deer, and dew-dropped spider webs. She watches the sun break over fog-shrouded hills.</p>
<p>Along with the energizing aspects of riding, nature offers her those daily gifts.</p>
<p>&#8220;That totally keeps me going up the hill,&#8221; she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e123bdc1807270460164b11c778ff1e3"><name>sab-elections</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff Advisory Board Elections</title><summary>It's time to vote for our next or returning Staff Advisory Board members.</summary><keywords>SAB</keywords><start-date>1335168000000</start-date><display-name>Staff Advisory Board Elections</display-name><path>/2012/04/sab-elections</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/sab-elections</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1335217077613</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1335217111133</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>It's time to vote for our next or returning Staff Advisory Board members.</span>

Program (DANM) will conclude two years of artistic study with "I've got something on your mind"--an exhibition of their work running April 28 through May 6 at the UCSC Digital Arts and Research Center.<br/>
<br/>
The exhibition will showcase digital art with social impact, featuring works that employ advanced technologies to explore the boundaries of contemporary new media art.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>&#8220;This year, the artists</strong> selected the title &#8216;I've got something on your mind&#8217; for their exhibition, which exemplifies their collective spirit of lightheartedness and fun-loving approach,&#8221; noted DANM faculty member <strong>Soraya Murray</strong>, curator of the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;The phrase points to something impossible--like the short-circuit in logic that happens when you look at an M.C. Escher image, or when you try to simultaneously hold two contradictory thoughts in your mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this isn't to say that they aren't tackling the serious issues and challenges of our time,&#8221; Murray added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beneath the exuberance, these students ask potent questions about increasing alienation in contemporary life as a result of separation from nature, from each other, and from achieving our best selves.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>For example, Daniel Christopher's</strong> &#8220;Journey Through Light&#8221; is a game in which participants are presented with an orb that reacts and glows colorfully when triggered at different sculptural sites around the exhibition venue.</p>
<p>But a huge part of the piece&#8212;which seems purely playful and abstract&#8212;is that players must temporarily hand over their cell phones and engage with the locale as well as other players, in order for the artwork to be fully experienced.</p>
<p>&#8220;This speaks a great deal to the importance of Christopher's desire to foster live interaction as opposed to highly "mediated" engagements like Twitter and Facebook that are often associated with advanced technology,&#8221; Murray noted.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Lee Logas</strong> creates a living laboratory, called &#8220;Game-Reality Workshop,&#8221; in which participants can create or tweak games to learn how they teach us social values.</p>
<p>&#8220;By changing elements of existing games, or paying attention to how they make up new ones, players can think together about what ethics and morals they want to activate in each other,&#8221; said Murray.</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina Habel&#8217;s &#8220;</strong>Seeing Spectacle&#8221; focuses on different aspects of advertising culture, utilizing toys with visual shock-effects, billboard-style ads, infomercials, and <em>National-Enquire</em>r-style aesthetics to address extreme consumerism and how capitalism can push us further and further away from a relationship with nature.&#160;</p>
<p>Other student projects delve deep into fantasy, interactive storytelling, and role-playing to create epic adventures that point to human searches for meaning and purpose in the world.</p>
<p><strong>UCSC's Digital Arts and New Media</strong> M.F.A. program serves as a center for the development and study of digital media and the cultures it has helped create.</p>
<p>Faculty and students are drawn from a wide variety of backgrounds such as the arts, computer engineering, humanities, the sciences, and social sciences to pursue interdisciplinary artistic and scholarly research.</p>

<br/>
He spent his elementary school summers helping to support his family by picking carrots and potatoes in the fields near Soledad, working on ranches, and at a grain warehouse. He had a newspaper route, too.<br/>
<br/>
In high school, he packed apples and tomatoes, and worked the berry fields of Watsonville. For a time, he and his mother and one of his three siblings lived in a modified laundry shed behind a house on California Street.<br/>
<br/>
But the now-82-year-old founder and long-term director of the UCSC Institute of Marine Sciences, said even though times were tough, those years&#8212;especially the ones at Watsonville High&#8212;became &#8220;the basic, grounding platform&#8221; of his life.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Find the potentia</strong>l<br/>
<br/>
From teachers and coaches he learned the importance of working to a person&#8217;s potential, the value of teamwork, and the way education should open minds and unlock abilities. He carried those skills through his long career at the university, where he served as chair of the Campus Planning Committee on Marine Studies, dean of the Division of Natural Sciences, chair of the Department of Biology, and also as deputy and acting provost during the early development of Oakes College.<br/>
<br/>
On May 18, Doyle will be inducted into the Watsonville High School Alumni Hall of Fame during a special school assembly at the Henry J. Mello Center for the Performing Arts.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Bill Doyle was selected for all he has done,&#8221; said Peggy Ernst, chair of the Watsonville High Hall of Fame Committee.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Early shame</strong><br/>
<br/>
When Doyle arrived at Watsonville High in the fall of 1944, he was ashamed&#8212;not of his poverty&#8212;but that his parents were divorced during an era when intact families were the norm.&#160; He worried he wouldn&#8217;t fit in at a school that was much larger than the ones he had attended. Instead, he found a group of accepting students and supportive teachers who pushed their charges to learn to their full potential, allowing him to discover abilities he didn&#8217;t know he had.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#8220;They made you reflective,&#8221; Doyle said of his teachers in those years. &#8220;They used education to open doors, not close them.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The skinny, 6-foot-1 Doyle also played on the school&#8217;s football and basketball teams where he absorbed the lessons of working together.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#160;&#8220;I learned to listen well to people and find out what they think,&#8221; said Doyle.&#160; When he chaired academic committee meetings at UCSC, for instance, he never started with the words, &#8220;this is what I want to get done.&#8221;&#160; He urged discussion, the development of a shared vision.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Teachers' influence</strong><br/>
<br/>
It was that experience with teachers who helped and supported him&#8212;both in high school and at the university level&#8212;that prompted Doyle to consider education as a career. He confessed, however, that he toyed with the idea of being a professional musician after his high school music teacher exposed him to the beauty of the French horn&#8212;because there were already too many trumpets and saxophones in the band.<br/>
<br/>
Those lessons, about the value of education, along with his work in the fields alongside the financially and educationally disadvantaged, prompted him to accept the invitation of Herman Blake and Rafael Guzman to leave Cowell College and join the nascent Oakes College in 1971.<br/>
<br/>
The college, they told him, would serve as a springboard for those from different ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.&#160; They also stressed the need for those same students to return to their communities as professionals in science, medicine and technology. After talking with his wife, Doyle said &#8220;yes.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Research continues</strong><br/>
<br/>
Doyle&#8217;s research continues in retirement. Publications include five botanical books, one of which was translated into Spanish for use in Mexico and another into Sinhala and Tamil by the Ceylon&#8212;now Sri Lanka&#8212;government for use in that country.&#160; He has also written a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/05/doyle-book.html">book on early campus development</a> and 32 articles in scientific journals.<br/>
<br/>
The work he has done for UCSC and marine science, along with his rise from field worker to professor, is an inspiration to the current crop of students at Watsonville High, Ernst said.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#8220;He will be a real example to our students about what they can accomplish if they want to,&#8221; she said.<br/>

<p>The two-year, $1.5 million project is sponsored by the National Institute of Justice and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.</p>
<p>The commission will focus on existing scientific evidence on incarceration in the United States and propose a research agenda on incarceration and alternatives to incarceration for the future.&#160; More than 2.3 million people are behind bars in U.S. prisons and jails, representing one of the highest incarceration levels in the world.</p>
<p>Haney's research concerns the application of social psychological principles and data to various legal and civil rights issues. He has specialized in the assessment of institutional environments, especially the psychological effects of incarceration, as well as the study of social histories of persons accused or convicted of serious violent crimes.</p>
<p>The panelists will study why incarceration rates in the country have skyrocketed since the 1970s, examine costs and benefits of the nation's current sentencing and incarceration policies, and look into whether alternative punishments might net similar public safety benefits at lower financial and social costs.</p>
<p>Jeremy Travis, president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, will chair the panel.</p>
<p>Others panelists are Jeffrey Beard, former secretary of the Pennsylvania Corrections Department, now at Pennsylvania State University; Robert Crutchfield, sociologist at the University of Washington; Tony Fabelo of the Council of State Governments Justice Center; Marie Gottschalk, professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania; Randall Kennedy, professor of law at Harvard University; Glenn C. Loury, professor of social sciences and economics at Brown University; Sara McLanahan, professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton University; Lawrence Mead, professor of politics and public policy at New York University; Ann Morrison Piehl, professor of economics at Rutgers University; Daniel Nagin, professor of public policy and statistics at&#160; Carnegie Mellon University; Devah Pager, a professor of sociology at Princeton;&#160; Robert Sampson, professor of social sciences at Harvard and president of the American Society of Criminology; Heather Thompson, professor of history at Temple University; Michael Tonry, professor of law of the University of Minnesota; Avelardo Valdez, professor of social work at the University of Southern California; and Bruce Western, professor of sociology at Harvard.</p>

"Josh was head and shoulders above his classmates in terms of his understanding of the material, his ability to think critically, and his technical prowess," said Polyzotis, an associate professor of computer science in the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>In fact, Rosen was not a graduate student, but a junior transfer from Cabrillo College who happened to have an exceptional aptitude for computer science. Polyzotis promptly invited him to work on a research project, and before long Rosen was deeply involved in a collaborative project with researchers at UC Irvine and Yahoo Research to develop better tools for large-scale data processing. In addition to his productive engagement in this research, Rosen managed to rack up an impressive 15 A+ grades and four A's in his classes at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Rosen is the 2012 winner of the Huffman Prize, awarded annually to a Baskin School of Engineering graduating senior whose academic career at UCSC exhibits extraordinary creativity, depth of inquiry, and overall excellence. The Huffman Prize honors the memory and the legacy of its namesake, David A. Huffman, professor emeritus of computer science. "Joshua is a student that David Huffman would have loved to have in his class, and I'm sure Joshua would have loved learning from David," said Charlie McDowell, professor of computer science and associate dean for undergraduate affairs in the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Rosen said the research project with Polyzotis enabled him to work with industry researchers on a real-world problem. The project addresses challenges involved in analyzing large volumes of data and could yield significant improvements in performance and efficiency for existing machine-learning algorithms. Rosen's role involved adding new capabilities to a complex software system called Hyracks, a platform for data-intensive computing developed at UC Irvine.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Yahoo Research gave the team access to real-world data and computing clusters. "It allowed us to see how the system we built would work in a real-world environment," Rosen said. "It was a great project to work on, and I'm really grateful for the opportunity UCSC provides to get involved in such research. To be recognized with the Huffman Prize is just icing on the cake."</p>
<p>According to Polyzotis, Rosen's work contributed directly to two technical papers submitted to top-tier computer science conferences.</p>
<p>"Overall, Josh exhibited great implementation skills, the ability to think and act independently, and the ability to think critically about his project," Polyzotis said. "Frankly, I am amazed that he was able to accomplish so much as an undergraduate student. This level of productivity is impressive even for a graduate student."</p>
<p>Rosen will begin graduate school at UC Berkeley in the fall.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ef9015468072704600d82ac24f33a40f"><name>calsoyas-essay</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Walking and talking: Learning outside the classroom door</title><summary>In her essay, UCSC lecturer Candace Calsoyas discusses the Aristotelian method of conversation and learning while on foot, a practice she introduced in Albania and brings to the College Eight core course.  &#13;

<br/>
A UC Berkeley grad, Calsoyas moved to Santa Cruz and became an organic farmer. Meanwhile, she continued to study biology and literature at UCSC, where her Ph.D. focused on women and land. She taught Literature of the Sea aboard the California Maritime ship, The Golden Bear, and taught on the world voyage of Semester at Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Making use of her organic farming expertise, she taught the College Eight garden internship. Her farm also serves as a model of sustainability that College Eight&#160; students visit for their field project in the Core Course.</p>
<p>She's taught environmental literature at the University of Tirana in Albania as a Fulbright scholar. Next year, she will teach the Senior Exit Class in Environmental Studies, focusing on experiential learning.</p>
<p>In her essay below, Calsoyas presents her views on the peripatetic learning experience.</p>

<p><em><strong>By Candace Calsoyas</strong></em></p>
<p>Toting 50 copies of Bill McKibben's <em>American Earth: Environmental Writing Since Thoreau</em> and a box of <em>Orion</em> magazines, I had come to Albania on a Fulbright fellowship to teach environmental literature. I knew little except that the country recently came out of a dreary, 50-year communist dictatorship and I suspected that environmentalism was unknown.<br/>
<br/>
When students read Thoreau, Alice Walker, Rachel Carson, they discovered a different image of America; they were astounded by the courage of environmentalists. &#8220;A normal wife and mother like Lois Gibbs took on Hooker Chemical Company,&#8221; they remarked. They awakened to the problems of their country, to the strewn plastic and garbage and the heavily polluted air.<br/>
<br/>
Like the city, the University of Tirana was old and in disrepair, not to mention the lack of Internet and even chalk. So it seemed natural, to get out of the classroom, walk to the &#8220;Artificial Lake&#8221; where we did exercises to connect, to what students called, &#8220;the nature.&#8221;&#160; Exposure to nature writing, and writing essays about villages where they were from created an&#160; awareness&#160; and a physical sense of their country: they&#160; became eco-literate.&#160; Students researched problems such as dumpsites, thermoelectric plants, and one student, passionate about Rachel Carson, wanted to translate <em>Silent Spring</em> into Albanian.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The out-of-curiosity essay</strong><br/>
<br/>
Back at UC Santa Cruz teaching freshmen seminars on &#8220;Environment and Society,&#8221; I considered how to combine peripatetic learning and critical thinking. In an article, &#8220;Our Universities: Why are they Failing?&#8221; Anthony Grafton points to a study showing that after two years of college, 45 percent of students have not improved in critical thinking, complex thinking, and writing. Additionally, Grafton says that professors gabble through PowerPoints while graduate students do the real teaching of undergraduates. He also cites statistics showing that students study less, now an average of 12 hours a week down from 25 hours in 1961. (<em>The New York Review of Books</em>,&#160; Nov. 24, 2011)<br/>
<br/>
&#160;In line with this critique, students, expecting to be spoon-fed, ask &#8220;what do you want us to do &#8230; how do you want this essay?&#8221; I seldom felt I had a convincing answer to these questions and sounding feeble I would make a stab: &#8220;I want you to write it in a way that works for you.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
So I forced accountability&#8211;throwing away the spoon and forcing them to instigate their learning process, in other words, to think. The strategy seemed easy enough:&#160; &#8220;Write a one-page 'out-of-curiosity essay' in which you pose a question that cropped up from the reading. Then create a balanced discussion addressing the question.&#8221;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
In class, students partner, exchange essays and then walk while discussing the questions. The day is balmy as we amble through meadows overlooking crystalline Monterey Bay. They walk in pairs, waving their one-pages and freely talking. Walking dispels nervousness of being put on the spot in the classroom, gives students the safety of interacting one-to-one, and is just plain fun! It is a peripatetic exercise, named after Aristotle's school. He believed that strolling in the shade of grape arbors was conducive to an in-depth student/teacher exchange.<br/>
<br/>
As I walk closer, I hear a student critiquing his partner's essay; he suggests that God seems irrelevant in Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, since many of his characters have lost faith.&#160;&#160;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Shifting the learning dynamic</strong><br/>
<br/>
Arriving at a vista where we can sit, students have spent about 15 minutes talking. Walking shifts the teaching dynamic: students are not just empty vessels waiting to be filled but are active in their learning. And they have practiced, so they are ready to comment to the larger group. I start by asking, &#8220;Was your partner's question a good one?&#8221; Then the class critiques what makes a good question and an effective discussion. Is God relevant in Grapes of Wrath? &#8220;Certainly,&#8221; responds a student, &#8220;as there are many biblical references including the name of the novel and Casy's loss of faith which brings up the whole issue of religion.&#8221; These questions then serve as a springboard for my own agenda and as&#160; a departure point for key concepts and&#160; analysis of the text.<br/>
<br/>
When the class read Eric Schlosser's chapter &#8220;What's in the Meat,&#8221; from Fast Food Nation, Sarah posed the question: &#8220;Is it overproduction that creates problems in the food industry?&#8221; The question&#160; reflected her curiosity about the roots and sources of problems in food and why, to quote Schlosser's memorable line, is there &#8220;shit in the meat?&#8221; With too many quotes, Sarah's essay left little room for her discussion. When I suggested she paraphrase, she caught on quickly.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#160;At times, questions that seemed overly broad actually produced lively debate, but, as students began to realize, could not be dealt with adequately in just one page. Again in response to Eric Schlosser, Kim asked, &#8220;If fast-food is so bad, why isn't it banned?&#8221; Discussing rights of the consumer, the parallels of cigarette and alcohol consumption, showed that the issue was not only complex, but huge. Students, seeing how much could be said about a question, shifted from the usual dread of writing papers to enthusiasm, and were eager to write the longer essays. Using her question, Jamie derived the topic for the longer essay: &#8220;Is it unethical to not label genetically modified food?&#8221; The question provoked, not only a discussion about labeling, but a debate about what is ethical. From the discussion, she gathered more information to include in her essay.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Provocative questions</strong><br/>
<br/>
&#160;Learning how to pose and discuss provocative questions effectively was initially a bumpy ride, but students rapidly improved and by the third curiosity essay, they had greatly improved.&#160; Additionally, the mini-essays were overall less daunting and receiving concise criticisms on a one-page essay was less disheartening than receiving heavily marked long essays with multiple problems.&#160; As the essays improved, grading become less onerous and though there were more assignments, I shortened the length of longer essays. By the time students wrote longer essays, they had completed four &#8220;out-of-curiosity&#8221; essays with the result that their papers were much more coherent and better organized.<br/>
<br/>
Even though the UCSC campus is ideal for the&#160; &#8220;Walk and Talk&#8221; exercise, urban Albania, where students had seldom ventured forth from the classroom, was equally if not more successful. However, the &#8220;out-of-curiosity essays&#8221; were only moderately successful, mostly because students were not as adept in reading and writing English.<br/>
<br/>
At UCSC, students liked the curiosity essays and noted that they now could easily come up with questions which generally helped class participation and writing papers. They also admitted to initially being frightened by the &#8220;walk and talk,&#8221; having to speak to another student, but that too became easier. Though UCSC is exceptionally beautiful with its mountain perch, majestic redwoods, and textured seascape below, still every landscape and cityscape suits the &#8220;walk and talk.&#8221; Unlike being in the classroom, students are liberated by being outside, their dialogue shaped by environs.<br/>

<div>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz campus is ethereal, otherworldly, a school plucked out of a storybook and nestled in the midst of a redwood forest.&#160;Where else can one see a coyote from a classroom window and stroll past deer between lunch and lab? Mountain lions have been spotted and, of course, plenty of banana slugs. The air here smells fresh.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In this environment, it&#8217;s hard not to be an environmentalist. UCSC has gained renown for its deep commitment to sustainability, and the stereotype of the Santa Cruz hippie has also become familiar both on and off campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;People outside of here think everyone here is really radical,&#8221; says Michael Tea (College Nine &#8216;12, economics and environ-mental studies).</p>
<p>Yet the throwback &#8220;hippie&#8221;&#160;archetype is in need of a major&#160;update. UCSC students are undertaking serious endeavors that combine pragmatic problem-solving with the optimism and innovation of campus&#160;culture. Instead of just carrying signs, they draft plans, research,&#160;team up with the greater&#160;Santa Cruz&#160;community,&#160;and achieve&#160;real change.</p>
<p>From harnessing wind energy&#160;to rethinking food systems&#160;and farming organically,&#160;environmentalism might be&#160;idealistic here&#8212;but it&#8217;s&#160;also very practical.</p>
<h3>UCSC on the Wharf</h3>
<p>Walk down the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf and look up toward the roofs of the shops and restaurants. If the wind is blowing, the white arms of a small wind turbine will be whirring in rotation, as the turbine generates power for wharf vehicle batteries. The turbine is part of the Green Wharf Projects, a partnership between the City<br/>
of Santa Cruz and UCSC.</p>
<p>Tiffany Wise-West, environmental studies Ph.D. candidate, manages the Green Wharf Projects. With years of engineering experience, she gravitated toward practical enterprises.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I got involved with UCSC, I knew environmental activism was prevalent here, but I didn&#8217;t know about the applied research in this field,&#8221; Wise-West says. &#8220;There are so many interesting projects&#8212;once you prove yourself capable, everybody wants you on their team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides the turbine and other renewable energy experiments, the Green Wharf Projects comprise three ventures in development: green business certification, an electric&#160;vehicle charging station, and an eco-tour.</p>
<p>The eco-tour will include stops at sea lion and renewable energy testbed viewing spots. Michael Tea, who leads the green business certification efforts, may give special mention on the tour to wharf businesses that meet green business criteria, turning eco-compliance into a marketing incentive.</p>
<p>The Green Wharf idea originated from wharf manager Jon Bombaci, who works closely with the UCSC team.</p>
<p>&#8220;This project is a great opportunity because it&#8217;s so collaborative, with students, faculty, community members and city reps,&#8221; says UCSC Climate Action Manager Lacey Raak.</p>
<p>Such collaborations are important in giving students a balanced view of factors affecting environmental policy. &#8220;There are many people who approach environmental issues very differently than the majority of UCSC students,&#8221; says environmental studies associate professor Tim Duane. &#8220;Students must learn to listen to those perspectives and try to meet others&#8217; needs in protecting the environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Tea acknowledges frustration with learning to navigate bureaucratic processes, &#8220;at the same time, it makes me more eager to learn the system of implementing environmental projects.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Hope is action</h3>
<p>The Green Wharf Projects are sponsored in part by the UCSC Carbon Fund, created by students and funded through student fees. The Carbon Fund currently bankrolls about a dozen eco-projects.</p>
<p>The UCSC Office of Sustainability oversees the Carbon Fund and other campus eco-programs, including green office certification and sustainability internships.</p>
<p>Aurora Winslade, the office director and founder, arrived as a student more than a decade ago, not knowing much about sustainability. Here, she became aware of the dire state of the world&#8217;s ecosystems and the slow implementation of solutions.</p>
<p>She connected with environmentalist Frances Moore Lappe&#8217;s message: &#8220;Hope is not what we find in evidence, it&#8217;s what we become in action.&#8221; Though there were like-minded classmates who also wanted to act, efforts were scattered and no one was looking strategically at university structure and policies. The need was there for a system to support a vibrant movement.</p>
<p>After graduating, Winslade stayed on as an employee and the Office of Sustainability was born to provide the needed support. At the time, in 2004, there were perhaps a few dozen full-time campus sustainability professionals across the country. Now there are well over 1,000, Winslade says. She recently was named the first director of sustainability for the University of Hawaii&#8217;s new West O&#8217;ahu campus scheduled to open in the fall.</p>
<p>Interested students can find numerous ways to be engaged. Gabi Kirk (Kresge &#8216;12, environmental studies and history), Office of Sustainability events coordinator, helped start a campaign to end the sales of single-use plastic water bottles on campus. The campaign, &#8220;Take Back the Tap,&#8221; is now the subject of her senior thesis.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a great experience for me to meld together social movement theory, facts about water privatization and plastic, and community organizing skills into one project,&#8221; Kirk says.</p>
<h3>Serving up change</h3>
<p>UCSC Dining provides upward of 20,000 meals a day, making sustainability efforts here especially effective. The Dining system was the first place in Santa Cruz to be certified by the Monterey Bay Green Business Program, meeting 175 criteria in areas including water conservation, waste management, and recycling.</p>
<p>Clint Jeffries, green business manager for UCSC Dining, is in charge of greening those 20,000 daily meals. His team constantly tweaks its offerings to make them more delicious and eco-friendly. Two years ago, they introduced a weekly &#8220;beefless&#8221; day into the menu and last year they stepped things up with a &#8220;Meatless Monday.&#8221; Each Monday, one of the five dining halls takes a turn serving an all-vegetarian menu.</p>
<p>At first, the meatless menu, heavy on &#8220;meat analogs,&#8221; brought some negative feedback. This year, they shifted from dishes using imitation meats to those showcasing vegetables, like vegan samosas and palak paneer. Complaints have stopped.</p>
<p>To Jeffries, the dining hall is not just a place where students eat. &#8220;As students come through, they learn things they weren&#8217;t expecting,&#8221; Jeffries says. &#8220;They can take what they learned and change things outside the university.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simply by getting meals at a dining hall, students are made aware of the movement to eat a more plant-based diet, and why such a diet is healthier for body and planet. Some measures, such as increasing the percentage of campus waste that is composted, take time to implement. Other programs are surprisingly simple, such as turning off lights when natural light is adequate in the dining halls. That program, &#8220;Dining by Daylight,&#8221; has saved a substantial amount of energy.</p>
<p>UCSC Dining tries to use organic and local sources when possible, and there is none more local than the university farms. An intern working with Jeffries recently realized they were not taking advantage of campus produce and started Farm Fridays, with featured dishes made from items grown at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) Farm and Garden. The first Farm Friday dish was a scrumptious-sounding organic quinoa cake topped with roasted butternut squash, saut&#233;ed kale, and blood orange vinaigrette.</p>
<h3>On the Farm</h3>
<p>As he stands in a CASFS field, Damian Parr, CASFS research and education coordinator, yanks up a legume from the cover crop bed and points at the tangle of roots. On the roots are nodules that house bacteria, Parr explains. The bacteria convert nitrogen into a form plants can use; in turn, the host plant provides the bacteria with carbohydrates. This symbiotic relationship is one of many ways farmers improve plant growth without using chemical fertilizers.</p>
<p>On these 25 acres of farmland overlooking the Pacific Ocean, CASFS tests the ecological principles behind organic farming. There is little bare soil here, as cover crops stretch over the land. Growing season is extended through greenhouses, soil is fertilized with manure and compost, microclimates are created by positioning plants strategically. A hand-dug section enables experiments in growing without machinery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many areas, even in the U.S., have high unemployment rates and food insecurity,&#8221; Parr says. &#8220;If you can use human labor to produce food intensively, right in the community where people are food insecure, that&#8217;s an efficient use of labor and space.&#8221;</p>
<p>CASFS also runs the three-acre Alan Chadwick Garden, created in 1967. The Farm was built four years later, with a six-month apprenticeship program run through UCSC Extension, that provides practical training in organic gardening and small-scale farming. UCSC undergraduates can research and intern at CASFS, and some become apprentices as well.</p>
<p>CASFS provides produce for dozens of families, some low-income, in the Santa Cruz community every summer. Apprentices have gone on to start their own commercial farms and inner-city community gardens; some have developed similar practical horticultural programs at other universities. Parr, for example, co-founded the Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems major at UC Davis after his CASFS apprenticeship in the &#8216;90s, before returning to his UCSC roots.</p>
<h3>Symbiosis on campus</h3>
<p>As on the farm, campus sustainability is more effective when all the parts work together symbiotically. The next step for UCSC, Winslade believes, is to create a strategic plan that includes instruction, research, campus life, and operations.</p>
<p>She compares such a plan to a garden where planting has been thoughtful. &#8220;If you plant beans here, they might produce a nutrient that improves squash there&#8212;in the end everything grows better,&#8221; Winslade says. &#8220;Right now, the plants are growing without us necessarily having considered how to create the most effective and mutually beneficial relationships. But we now have the opportunity to position UCSC so it continues to be a sustainability leader.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last summer, visitors at the Tech Museum in San Jose had the chance to step off our planet and hurl a star into the cosmos.</p>
<p>On a screen in front of them lay a black hole waiting to yank in an errant star that visitors attempted to throw toward it at just the right angle and speed. A star isn&#8217;t sucked in and gobbled up by a black hole very often&#8212;in real life, only once every hundred thousand years or so. But when a museum visitor&#8217;s thrown star was destroyed&#8212;what astronomers refer to as &#8220;tidal disruption&#8221;&#8212;the screen on the wall exploded in a concussive burst of red light.</p>
<p>Using a Nintendo Wii remote connecting the user to the display, the game was just one result of collaborations between scientists and artists from UC Santa Cruz through a project called OpenLab.</p>
<p>The idea of OpenLab is simple: Bring together a group of specialists from different disciplines and task them with leveraging each other&#8217;s strengths to create new ways to visualize scientific research. What often results is a uniquely interactive work of art that changes the way its viewers think about difficult-to-understand concepts. In this case, &#8220;They will remember forever that they themselves disrupted a star,&#8221; says Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics, who co-founded OpenLab.</p>
<p>Viewers have the chance to experience science in a way that&#8217;s not possible by attending a lecture. &#8220;You&#8217;re experiencing something as it exists that&#8217;s less passive,&#8221; says Jennifer Parker, associate professor of sculpture, interactive art, new media, and kinetic art and one of the founders of OpenLab. &#8220;It&#8217;s the difference between seeing a picture of the ocean and going to the beach.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<h3>Breaking down barriers&#160;</h3>
<p>Before OpenLab, Parker and Ramirez-Ruiz had worked together through a project involving a mutual student. From that process, Parker realized the campus wasn&#8217;t set up for students or faculty to step out of their specialties and make use of the facilities and human capital in other departments. &#8220;I was really frustrated as a faculty member,&#8221; Parker says. &#8220;I thought, &#8216;Why can&#8217;t we just walk over to engineering and use some of their things?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, in the winter of 2011, art history student Amy Boewer and business student Jack O&#8217;Neill, both undergraduates at UCSC, had an idea for a convertible sleeping pad for use by urban nomads&#8212;typically young people, many artists themselves, who have chosen not to live permanently in any one city. The pad could be converted into a chair, a poncho, or a bag as these artist-wanderers travel from city to city. Boewer and O&#8217;Neill had a name for their invention&#8212;&#8221;Nomad Pad&#8221;&#8212;but no place to make a prototype and no equipment to test their design. So Boewer approached Parker, and the seeds for OpenLab began to germinate.</p>
<p>Parker soon found that other students were &#8220;hungry&#8221; for that type of cross-disciplinary interaction&#8212;students like Sudhu Terwari. A graduate student in music and art, he leapt at the chance to draw inspiration from science.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scientists look at physical phenomena and derive ideas from what they observe, and artists take ideas and turn them into physical objects,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It makes sense that the two would inform each other.</p>
<p>Terwari was part of a team that developed a three-dimensional zoetrope&#8212;a spinning sculpture of 12 different scenes depicting a collision between our moon and a sister moon that once orbited the Earth.</p>
<p>The zoetrope and the Wii game came out of groups that participated in Summer Institute, the pilot program for OpenLab held in 2011 and the brainchild of Boewer, O&#8217;Neill, Parker, and Ramirez-Ruiz. The quartet developed an idea for a forum in which scientists share a concept from their own research and get artists&#8217; take on it. Then, in four- to seven-member teams, they work to find a unique way to not merely illustrate the concept, but visualize it to engage viewers.</p>
<p>Parker likens the Summer Institute creative process to making a movie, where every individual involved has a specific role to play, drawing on the strengths of, say, someone who studies computer science, a researcher with technical knowledge about collisions in outer space, and a sculptor adept at working with clay.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives people a certain amount of autonomy within their skill set while learning from each other,&#8221; Parker explains.</p>
<h3>&#8216;It&#8217;s working&#8217;</h3>
<p>And it turns out there was a lot to learn. When James Guillochon, a fifth-year graduate student in astrophysics who works with Ramirez-Ruiz, first presented his research on tidal disruption by black holes to the group, he realized he needed to simplify his explanation of how a super-dense point in space could exert a force powerful enough to destroy a star.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of us asked really simple questions that I don&#8217;t think the astrophysics students had ever gotten before,&#8221; says O&#8217;Neill of the artists who partook in Summer Institute.</p>
<p>As the discussions ensued, Guillochon honed his explanation to contain only the most essential pieces. &#8220;I needed to cut out the right things,&#8221; he says. Once the group understood, he says, an idea began to take shape for a way to convey this type of event: &#8220;We wanted to have the user playing God and disrupting stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they built the game from video simulations he had created through his research, Guillochon says they had to sacrifice a bit of accuracy&#8212;in the game, for example, stellar disruptions occur more often than once every hundred thousand years. But Guillochon&#8217;s team decided that leaving the user with a memorable experience was more important.</p>
<p>At the Summer Institute exhibition at the Tech Museum, Boewer said she only had to look around to measure their success. &#8220;People were walking around with cocktails learning about black holes and stars,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I remember thinking, &#8216;It&#8217;s working.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<h3>STEM to STEAM</h3>
<p>The excitement surrounding OpenLab dovetails with growing support nationwide for the STEM to STEAM initiative, which is based on the belief that arts should be as important in our education system as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics&#8212;&#8221;STEM,&#8221; which becomes &#8220;STEAM&#8221; with the addition of the arts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We give children so much more freedom to engage in art than to engage in science,&#8221; says Ramirez-Ruiz. By allowing the interplay between art and science as equally important disciplines and encouraging the creativity so often only associated with the arts, OpenLab can impact even the most specialized researchers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just working with the artists has really opened a new dimension to the way that I think and a new dimension to the way I visualize the world,&#8221; adds Ramirez-Ruiz.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the real benefit of OpenLab&#8212;the potential to kickstart the imaginations of researchers about their work. &#8220;The concept just becomes a blood infusion,&#8221; says Parker.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more important than the specific concept are the tools that each participant gains in the process. The vision is for OpenLab to extend beyond the Summer Institute program into a campus-wide network of facilities that allow access to students and faculty from other disciplines&#8212;perhaps marked with an &#8220;O&#8221; (for OpenLab) sticker on the doors. Most of the current facilities are part of the Arts Division, based at OpenLab&#8217;s epicenter in the Digital Arts Research Center, but OpenLab participants also have access to several other spots on campus, including the Supercomputer Lab for Undergraduates, known as SLUG.</p>
<p>By making use of existing resources and equipment, OpenLab came to fruition with relatively minimal funding. Ramirez-Ruiz rallied money from the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Packard Foundation, and the UC Santa Cruz Foundation. And the Arts Department chipped in as well. Arts Dean David Yager saw the value of this collaborative approach and provided a research grant to get the project off the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things are accomplished by people from lots of disciplines looking at the same issue and trying to figure out what might be the real problem or question and then focusing on the solution,&#8221; Yager says. &#8220;We don&#8217;t live in silos anymore in the real world.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Another Renaissance</h3>
<p>&#8220;The palette of expertise that you need to succeed in the world today is much more complex than before,&#8221; says Ramirez-Ruiz, adding that he&#8217;d like to see OpenLab address global problems such as climate change or crippling poverty, because viable solutions to these problems require people who understand more than just climatology or economics.</p>
<p>Parker sees the OpenLab approach as a nod to the great thinkers of the Renaissance. &#8220;Leonardo was as much a scientist as a maker,&#8221; she says, and DaVinci&#8217;s thinking wasn&#8217;t constrained by the labels &#8220;artist&#8221; or &#8220;scientist.&#8221; He was both.</p>
<p>Enter 21st century renaissance thinkers like Jack O&#8217;Neill and Amy Boewer. Since graduating in June 2011, they&#8217;ve been working to develop OpenLab, and they run their own Web design firm, GirlBoy Media. Nomad Pad is also on the verge of taking off. Staying true to OpenLab-style thinking, they&#8217;re currently searching for research groups in the UC system with which to collaborate on materials and design. The goal is to produce a pad that costs less than a buck and could even be donated in a pinch to displaced disaster victims.</p>
<p>Like Nomad Pad, OpenLab is only a reality because Boewer and O&#8217;Neill saw an opportunity to improve the status quo and came up with a solution with the help of two forward-thinking faculty members.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea really just started with two students in the middle of the night dying for some space and support,&#8221; recalls Boewer. Thanks to OpenLab, that&#8217;s a situation UCSC students aren&#8217;t apt to find themselves in again.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s when you realize what looks like a digitally rendered photographic billboard&#160;of Martin Luther King Jr.&#8217;s face, for&#160;example, is not digital, photographic, or even a billboard.</p>
<p>Peer closely and you&#8217;ll see dry-brush strokes, a dot of white paint on King&#8217;s right eye and splatters of color on the ground.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re the telltale marks of Jim Urban, 58, the man behind every meticulously hand-rendered barn sign since 1978.</p>
<p>While his artwork may publicize cultural events on campus, Urban himself remains one of the university&#8217;s best-kept artistic secrets. He spends two days, sometimes in the dark, rendering each piece of work with &#8220;regular cheap brushes&#8221; and industrial-strength Kelly-Moore paints, carrying out commissions on barn space that UCSC community members reserve up to a year in advance.</p>
<p>Calm and soft-spoken, Urban follows instructions closely, trying to copy smaller versions of the pictures as faithfully as possible. And yet the results often look like magic. &#8220;Sometimes I&#8217;ll drop in shadows, halos, and other little artistic effects,&#8221; Urban said.</p>
<p>You can see the texture on his painted straw hats. He can create accurate human flesh tones, or can make his artwork photorealistic or cartoonish depending on the assignment.</p>
<p>But why would UCSC use such a low-tech, ultra-analog method to get the word out about its events?</p>
<p>For one thing, it works, says Sabrina Eastwood, promotions manager for UCSC&#8217;s Arts Division office. &#8220;If you are coming and going in a car on the east side of campus, you&#8217;ll see his signs twice a day. If you&#8217;re sitting in traffic, you must be staring at Jim&#8217;s signs and wondering how they got there.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added, &#8220;no one else in the world&#8221; can do what Urban does. &#8220;It is a really specialized, weird job. Imagine if we put out a job description: &#8216;Successful job applicant must know how to project an image on a barn after dark, even on chilly winter nights, and apply layers of paint while crossing their fingers that it won&#8217;t rain. Must stand on a ladder for an hour or two.&#8217; It&#8217;s not a really sexy job, but Jim, God bless him, is a community-minded guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is only one downside to this throwback approach. Once Urban paints over his original artwork, it&#8217;s gone forever.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he&#8217;s taken many souvenir snapshots over the years. &#8220;Sometimes I&#8217;ll like a sunset, a face or a logo and take a picture of that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his old artwork, for at least the past 10 years since the barn&#8217;s walls were resurfaced, has been accumulating, layer after layer. According to his best guess, there are more than 100 murals piling up in micro-thin strata on that barn wall.</p>
<p>Urban has spent 34 years on the job, so far resisting newfangled approaches and never using an airbrush.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you do things by hand, it leaves room for discovery and accident,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Some of these effects you just can&#8217;t get with the computer, and it leaves a little room for human error. Human error is sometimes very cool.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hanging in the bedroom of Irena Polic&#8217;s 4-year-old twins are two long strands of colorful beads, each representing a procedure her daughter Alexa endured as she fought off the tumor that attacked her liver when the girl was just two years old.</p>
<p>There are more than 200 beads, and in addition to marking the resilience of a tough toddler, each one could stand for a night Polic spent caring for her daughter and contemplating what it all meant.</p>
<p>Of course this was long after she spent a year living in her basement in her native Croatia while the Serbo-Croatian war raged outside in the streets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Living in war and having a child who faced death, these are the times you&#8217;re forced to think about your life, your place in the world, and why all this matters,&#8221; says Polic, the associate director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute for Humanities Research.</p>
<p>These are the questions of poets, philosophers, and historians. In academia, they are the questions of the people who study the humanities, and as any of them will tell you, they are also the questions of everyday life, though many people may not realize it.</p>
<p>People get science. Science sends us pictures of distant galaxies and stores digital photos in the cloud. Science cured Alexa&#8217;s cancer.</p>
<p>But the humanities are a different story.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a PR problem in the humanities,&#8221; says Polic, who is also an alumna (Cowell &#8216;01, linguistics; master&#8217;s &#8216;03). &#8220;A lot of people outside academia don&#8217;t know what the humanities mean. I find that when I tell people they involve the study of linguistics, literature, philosophy, history, religion, and ethics, they start to listen because all of these fields are extremely relevant to our daily lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, just shy of her 37th birthday and having faced down the adversity of three lifetimes, Polic is a coil of excited energy, so full of enthusiasm one can&#8217;t help but want to follow her.</p>
<p>In her role at the Institute for Humanities Research, it&#8217;s Polic&#8217;s mission to help the great thinkers in the UC system connect their ideas to the lives of everyday folks&#8212;people promenading on Pacific Avenue, for example.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a difficult job full of promise. Academics are so bonded to their work they often take its importance as self-evident and don&#8217;t always excel at explaining its relevance. But they are doing exciting and groundbreaking work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Irena makes you think about why it matters,&#8221; says Jim McCloskey, director of the Linguistics Research Center. &#8220;That&#8217;s really valuable to us; she gets excited on your behalf.&#8221;</p>
<p>That excitement was on display April 21 at the Museum of Art &amp; History in downtown Santa Cruz, where the institute hosted &#8220;What Are We Doing When We Do the Humanities?,&#8221; a showcase of the best recent research in the UC system, and a bit of a pressure cooker for researchers, who were called on to demonstrate the utility of their work to a non-academic audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Irena is having a big impact at the university,&#8221; said Dean of Humanities Bill Ladusaw. &#8220;Because of her work, the public has a chance to encounter new ideas and have their understanding of familiar things deepened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polic said the event was, in part, an effort to raise the visibility of the disciplines she holds so dear and the worldview she&#8217;s passing on to her children.</p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter would not be alive today without the amazing medical advances of the last 30 years,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Now that she&#8217;s alive she&#8217;ll be doing what the rest of us are trying to do, which is attempting to make sense of the human condition and her own life.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Fernanda Coppel came to the hilly UC Santa Cruz campus, her plan was to&#160;become a lawyer. Born in Mazatlan, she grew up in an all-female household in San Diego, working since she was 16 to support herself. The law, she believed, would&#160;provide a stable life.</p>
<p>A campus play put on by Don Williams&#8217;s Rainbow Theater shattered that carefully laid strategy, however.</p>
<p>Today, the 26-year-old Coppel lives in an apartment in Brooklyn and works two part-time jobs&#8212;but she also has a fellowship at the prestigious Juilliard School, and her off-Broadway play, Chimichangas and Zoloft, will soon be staged by the Tony Award&#8211;winning Atlantic Theater, which was founded by playwright David Mamet and actor William H. Macy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fernanda Coppel,&#8221; said Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning playwright Marsha Norman, who teaches at the famed arts school, &#8220;is one of the most electrifying talents we have ever seen at Juilliard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those who know Coppel describe her as humble, charismatic, intelligent, perceptive, and &#8220;a girl with a wicked sense of humor.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a telephone interview, Coppel admitted to the humor, which lurks in all her plays, but credited her mentors&#8212;Norman, Williams, and Emeritus Professor of Theater at UCSC Alma Martinez&#8212;for what is considered her nearly lightning-fast success in the world of theater.</p>
<p>It was Williams who first encouraged her, and Martinez who always said, &#8220;to be an artist means really studying the craft,&#8221; Coppel&#160;recounted. &#8220;It meant reading the classics and knowing how to construct a play.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also meant the intellectual tough love with which Martinez challenged her, something critical to Coppel&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>Coppel, who graduated from Merrill College in 2007 with a literature degree and got her MFA in dramatic writing from New York University, writes from the world around her and from her perspective as a young Latina lesbian.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be angry about something or I&#8217;ll see or connect with something, and I&#8217;ll research and write a story about that,&#8221; Coppel says.</p>
<p>Her latest play, Chimichangas and Zoloft, for instance, tells the story of a 40-year-old woman who, fueled by the twin influences of Zoloft and greasy chimichangas, flees her family and sets her teenage daughter and friend on a plan to bring her back. Meanwhile, the girls&#8217; fathers come face<br/>
to face with a secret sexuality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was coming out to myself and realizing who I was and that it wasn&#8217;t going to change,&#8221; Coppel said about writing the play, which won the 2009 Asuncion Queer Latino Festival in New York. She gives a quick laugh. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t just a Santa Cruz sort of thing. I was accepting it into my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other Coppel plays have featured a woman who dresses as a man in order to survive the violent drug cartels that engulf her, and a Ph.D. candidate whose mentor urges her to write her dissertation on her girlfriend&#8217;s working-class values&#8212;a choice that ends up forcing the student to choose between career and love.</p>
<p>&#8220;My whole M.O. is to write more parts for Latina women,&#8221; Coppel says, &#8220;to be different than what is seen in mainstream theater today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fernanda is the only writer we know who is writing about young Latin American women facing all the challenges of life in America, made more difficult by gender, sexual identity, and cultural origin,&#8221; playwright Norman said.</p>

She was petite, with short-cropped dark hair and a small heart tattooed on her hand. She had been brutally beaten.</p>
<p>At the time, police estimated the girl to be in her 20s but had little else to go on, and her murder soon drifted onto the cold case list.</p>
<p>Sixteen years later, enter Lauren Zephro, a tall, athletic forensic anthropologist. To Zephro (Cowell &#8216;93, anthropology), bones whisper and fingerprints talk.</p>
<p>Using new technology, including a cementum test of the girl&#8217;s teeth and isotopic hair analysis, Zephro discovered the girl was actually 14 to 18 years old and that, before her death, she likely traveled the coast between Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz. Zephro&#8217;s findings not only helped bring in new clues but also shifted the direction of the case, which is still under investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The girl was connected to someone, connected to the world,&#8221; said Zephro, sitting behind a metal, government-issued desk at the Santa Cruz County Sheriff&#8217;s Office forensics lab, where she now works. &#8220;I am confident, somewhere along the line, she will be identified.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a forensic anthropology course taught by UCSC Professor Alison Galloway (who was named campus provost/executive vice chancellor in 2010) that brought Zephro to this spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had never felt so alive as I did in that class,&#8221; Zephro said. &#8220;It was the moment in my academic career that set me on the path of everything I have done since.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went on to get her masters in anthropology from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and, with the help of a UC Regents Fellowship, is now a doctoral candidate in physical anthropology at UCSC. Meanwhile, she is working full-time for the Sheriff&#8217;s Office, a job that is sometimes dirty, often exhausting, and frequently painstaking. On any given day, Zephro may be lifting latent fingerprints from a firearm, climbing steep terrain in search of scattered bones, writing a detailed analysis of her findings, or testifying in court.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a super hard worker,&#8221; said Sgt. Alan Burt, who heads the sheriff&#8217;s coroner division. &#8220;She&#8217;ll go on scenes and be digging in the dirt and then she gives these tremendous reports&#8230;. It&#8217;s nice to have that brain power on your side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zephro&#8217;s work with fingerprints helped discover the killer of a Capitola man 32 years after the fact and send a murderer to prison for a Monterey County death. In that case, she combed through yards of tape that had been wrapped around a decaying body&#8212;a job so smelly it drove nearby deputies out of their offices&#8212;until she found a single fingerprint connected to a suspect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lauren has a questioning mind that keeps theoretical principles in mind but also questions those principles,&#8221; said Galloway, who is Zephro&#8217;s doctoral advisor and still works with her on cases. &#8220;She is meticulous and thoughtful in her work.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Zephro, Galloway was an inspiration and UCSC &#8220;a place that allowed me to reach my full potential; to tell me I had potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, someday, she promised, the girl known only as &#8220;Pogonip Jane&#8221; will be identified. Then, Zephro said, &#8220;she is coming home to all of us who wonder who she is.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: In December, Los Angeles attorney Kenneth A. Feingold (Cowell &#8216;71, history) was named an alumni Regent. He is the fourth UCSC alumnus to represent the campus on the UC Board of Regents.&#160;Two voting Regent positions rotate among the system&#8217;s 10 campuses. UC&#8217;s alumni Regents are selected for two-year terms. UCSC last selected&#160;the alumni Regent seven years ago.</em></p>
<p><em>Here,&#160;Feingold describes his goals for the position, as well as the challenges he expects.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As an alumni Regent, I will represent the entire UC system, not just my alma mater&#8212;but I will clearly bring a &#8220;Slug perspective&#8221; to the board. At UCSC, the vital importance of undergraduate education is in our DNA&#8212;but we&#8217;re also a great example of a successful, cutting-edge research institution and a place where community service is valued highly.</p>
<p>Our values are essential to the UCSC experience, and are also the core values of the UC system as a whole.</p>
<p>And therein lies the challenge. The Regents are charged with adopting policies and practices that promote access, research, teaching, and learning while operating within budget constraints. Everyone understands that the university faces a daunting budget situation, and the California legislature has been unwilling to provide adequate funding. The continuing spikes in tuition and housing costs pose a real, substantial burden to our students and their families.</p>
<p>As a UCSC alumnus, I want to promote policies that will ensure that qualified students, regardless of means, have access to an affordable, quality education; that promote diversity in admissions; and that provide sufficient faculty and resources to achieve first-rate research, teaching, and learning.</p>
<p>My immigrant grandmother never attended college, but she sent me $25 every month I was at UCSC to support my college education. I was fortunate that tuition was affordable in 1967. Every student who attends UC should be able to plan ahead without the rapid tuition increases we&#8217;ve experienced in recent years.</p>
<p>As an alumni Regent, I will promote a pathway for undergraduate students to graduate in four years, to increase retention and graduation rates for undergraduate and graduate students, and to foster and reward excellence in teaching and research.</p>
<p>As the cost of an education increases for students, so too must the university be vigilant in increasing programs and policies that serve students and foster excellence in faculty research and teaching.</p>

<p>Malia Bradley is working on a plan to harvest rainwater and use non-potable water for things like irrigation and toilet flushing on campus.</p>
<p>Soraya Danesh is helping students prepare for natural disasters and also make sure their residences are fire-safe.</p>
<p>While these tasks may seem administrator-worthy, UCSC undergrads are actually carrying them out as part of a unique mentorship arrangement called the Chancellor&#8217;s Undergraduate Internship Program, or CUIP.</p>
<p>Started 17 years ago as a way to open communication between administrators and students during a contentious time of budget cutbacks and campus development, it has turned into a solid way for students to hone their professional chops and for the university to have needs filled at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;My tag line for the program is, &#8216;learn, earn, and serve,&#8221; said Barbara Silverthorne, director of the Career Center. &#8220;I think it is the heart of what career development is all about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the program, as many as 36 students each year are matched with projects that will help the university in some way. They are required to work 15 hours per week, attend leadership classes introducing them to the inner workings of the university, and to have a concrete result at the end of the year. In exchange, they are given an $8,200 stipend toward their tuition.</p>
<p>CUIP interns have set up support programs for military veterans returning to college. They have redesigned a child-care center playground, found ways to encourage minority students to stay in school, helped create climate action plans, and analyzed survey data to provide student feedback to campus units. One student organized holistic health workshops to help students relieve stress. Another created a campus bicycle plan.</p>
<p>Along the way, they have learned career skills like problem-solving, consensus-building and self-motivation that are difficult to pick up in a classroom, Silverthorne said. Program alumni have gone on to work as political consultants, city planners, lawyers, academics, grassroots organizers, and teachers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They set up a system so you can work independently and also get support when you need it,&#8221; said 21-year-old Bradley (Kresge, &#8217;13, environmental studies).</p>
<p>Her internship with the university&#8217;s Good Neighbors program has taken her into neighborhoods to open lines of communication between student renters and permanent residents. It has also inspired her to work on her own water-harvesting and allocation proposal as a way to address one of the campus&#8217; critical town-gown issues: water supply and demand.</p>
<p>CUIP, said the Los Angeles native, allowed her to use her communication and problem-solving skills in new ways and also focus on issues important to her. Her goal is to be an environmental lawyer.</p>
<p>For 21-year-old Danesh (College 10, &#8217;13, psychology and economics), an internship with the UCSC Fire Department shifted her career goals.</p>
<p>The daughter of a CPA and a mother who escaped Iran during the revolution, Danesh said her experiences have led her to consider risk management as a career.</p>
<p>At the fire agency, she has been called on to find new ways to inform students about CPR and disaster preparedness classes, to get the word out about safety programs like the CruzAlert emergency notification system and also to help students ensure their off-campus residences are fire-safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt like this was something that could help students in a great way,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>CUIP relies on the UCSC Fund for half of its $250,000 budget, unrestricted money that is used to support top campus priorities.</p>
<p>Said Chancellor George Blumenthal: &#8220;Thanks to our donors, we can not only offer students a hands-on leadership experience but also get a tangible benefit for the university at the same time. It&#8217;s a winning combination.&#8221;</p>

<div><span>On Saturday,&#160; April 28, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., the UC Santa Cruz Police Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) will give the public another opportunity to prevent pill abuse and theft by ridding their homes of potentially dangerous expired, unused, and unwanted prescription drugs.</span>&#160;&#160;Bring your medications for disposal to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department near the Women's Center.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>The service is free and anonymous, no questions asked.&#160;<br/>

</span></div>
<div><span>Last October, Americans turned in 377,080 pounds&#8212;188.5 tons&#8212;of prescription drugs at over 5,300 sites operated by the DEA and nearly 4,000 state and local law enforcement partners.</span>&#160;&#160;In its three previous Take Back events, DEA and its partners took in almost a million pounds&#8212;nearly 500 tons&#8212;of pills.<span>&#160;</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>This initiative addresses a vital public safety and public health issue.</span>&#160;&#160;Medicines that languish in home cabinets are highly susceptible to diversion, misuse, and abuse. Rates of prescription drug abuse in the U.S. are alarmingly high, as are the number of accidental poisonings and overdoses due to these drugs.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>Studies show that a majority of abused prescription drugs are obtained from family and friends, including from the home medicine cabinet. In addition, Americans are now advised that their usual methods for disposing of unused medicines&#8212;flushing them down the toilet or throwing them in the trash&#8212;both pose potential safety and health hazards.&#160;<br/>
</div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Four days after the first event, Congress passed the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010, which amends the Controlled Substances Act to allow an &#8220;ultimate user&#8221; of controlled substance medications to dispose of them by delivering them to entities authorized by the Attorney General to accept them.</span>&#160;&#160;The Act also allows the Attorney General to authorize long term care facilities to dispose of their residents&#8217; controlled substances in certain instances.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>DEA is drafting regulations to implement the Act, a process that can take as long as 24 months.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>Until new regulations are in place, local law enforcement agencies like the UC Santa Cruz Police Department and the DEA will continue to hold prescription drug take-back events every few months.</div>

<h2>Astronomy find supports&#160;explanation&#160;of origins of&#160;elements</h2>
<p>For the first time, astronomers have&#160;found pristine clouds of the primordial&#160;gas that formed in the first few minutes&#160;after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>The composition of the gas matches theoretical predictions,&#160;providing direct evidence in support of the modern cosmological explanation for the origins of elements in the universe.</p>
<p>Only the lightest elements, mostly hydrogen and helium,&#160;were created in the Big Bang. Then a few hundred&#160;million years passed before clumps of this primordial&#160;gas condensed to form the first stars, where heavier&#160;elements were forged. Until now, astronomers&#160;have always detected &#8220;metals&#8221; (their term for all&#160;elements heavier than hydrogen and helium)&#160;wherever they have looked in the universe.</p>
<p>&#8220;As hard as we&#8217;ve tried to find pristine&#160;material in the universe, we have failed&#160;until now. This is the first time we&#8217;ve&#160;observed pristine gas uncontaminated&#160;by heavier elements from stars,&#8221; said&#160;J. Xavier Prochaska, UCSC professor&#160;of astronomy and astrophysics.</p>

<h2>Deserving alum honored for&#160;spirit, service</h2>
<p>Deutron Kebebew (Kresge &#8216;03, electrical engineering), former foster child and tireless advocate for teens and children, was this year&#8217;s winner of the fourth annual Tony Hill Memorial Award.</p>
<p>Kebebew received the award as part of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation on February 2&#8212;which happened to be Kebebew&#8217;s 35th birthday.</p>
<p>This special honor recognizes individuals whose lives and actions exemplify the late Tony Hill&#8217;s work and legacy. Hill, a longtime advocate for social and economic justice in Santa Cruz County, was known for his skills as a community bridge-builder and mediator. He died in 2007 at age 62.</p>
<p>Award recipients receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am really honored and humbled that I am being recognized, but I have a long way to go toward really earning it,&#8221; Kebebew said. &#8220;I will continue to do what I do until there are no foster youth in the system.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Astronomy prof awarded Franklin Medal</h2>
<p>Jerry Nelson, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, has been awarded the 2012 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Electrical Engineering.</p>
<p>Nelson is internationally renowned as a developer of innovative designs for advanced telescopes. The Franklin Institute is honoring him &#8220;for his pioneering contributions to the development of segmented-mirror telescopes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Franklin Institute awards are among the oldest and most prestigious comprehensive science awards in the world. Since 1824, the institute has honored excellence and achievement in science, engineering, and technology. The Franklin Medal was set to be awarded at a ceremony in Philadelphia in April.</p>
<h2>Foundation Forum highlights future of cancer treatments</h2>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Foundation Forum, &#8220;At the Dawn of Personalized Medicine,&#8221; presented a rare, front-lines look at the future of personalized cancer diagnosis and treatment. More than 200 guests listened to the discussion at the UCSC Music Recital Hall in October with J. Michael Bishop, university professor and chancellor emeritus at UCSF; Arthur D. Levinson, chairman and former CEO of Genentech; David Haussler, distinguished professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz; and moderator Moira Gunn of Tech Nation.</p>
<p>Cancer genomics will be used for early detection, personalized therapy, and diagnostics, Bishop said. In 1989, Bishop and Harold Varmus won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their research on cancer genes.</p>
<p>The next presenter, Levinson, who worked with Bishop and Varmus at UCSF as a postdoctoral researcher before joining Genentech in 1980, elaborated on some of the more &#8220;targeted approaches to cancer treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haussler is involved in efforts to catalog genetic abnormalities found in different types of cancers and find links between specific genetic changes and the ways that patients respond to different treatments.</p>

<h2>Video game&#160;gives good vibrations&#160;to visually impaired</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz graduate Rupa Dhillon hopes to change the face of gaming with Rock Vibe&#8212;a Rock Band&#8211;style electronic musical video game for people who are both blind and sighted.</p>
<p>Designed to be accessible to people with severe visual impairments, it replaces all necessary visual cues with auditory and tactile ones. Instead of using a screen to deliver information, it uses vibrations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Games for the blind right now are largely audio games, and they tend to get boring really quickly,&#8221; said Dhillon (MFA, digital arts and new media &#8216;09). &#8220;They also have very little appeal to sighted people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rock Vibe, she said, &#8220;creates a new mode of gaming because the players respond to vibrations. And combining that with popular music makes the game much more exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dhillon plans to release the game&#160;next year.</p>

<h2>Five students win Fulbright scholarships</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Five UC Santa Cruz students in four disciplines won Fulbright scholarships for a year of research and study abroad.&#160;</p>
<p>Two of the Fulbright scholars are environmental studies graduate students; the others are in history and literature, and another just received her Ph.D. in biology. They are traveling in China, Germany, Italy, and Mexico during the&#160;current academic year and are among more than 1,600 U.S. citizens who will travel abroad through the Fulbright U.S. student program.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<p>Joanna Ory, an environmental studies graduate student who will travel to Italy to research the effects of policies that limit herbicide use and promote sustainable pest management on corn farms in the Veneto region in the north.</p>
<p>Carolina Reyes, who graduated in 2011 with a Ph.D. in microbiology and environmental toxicology. Reyes will be working in Germany, focusing on microbial iron reduction (a process that reduces the oxidation state of the iron) in marine sediments in the Kattegat and Skagerrak region of the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>Devon Sampson, an environmental studies graduate student who is studying how Mayan farmers use biodiversity of crops to make a living and contend with pests, drought, and natural disasters.</p>
<p>Jeremy Tai, an East Asian history graduate student who will trace the &#8220;making, unmaking, and remaking&#8221; of Xi&#8217;an, one of China&#8217;s oldest cities, over the past 100 years.</p>
<p>Evan Calder Williams, a literature graduate student who will research Italian film and political writing, with particular emphasis on the 1970s.</p>

<h2>Soc Doc alumna&#160;behind camera&#160;at Tahrir Square</h2>
<p>UCSC alumna Bridgette Auger was following women activists in Egypt&#8217;s Tahrir Square when they came under fire during a clash between protesters and police last November.</p>
<p>Auger&#8212;who received her master&#8217;s degree in social documentation from UCSC last year&#8212;shot video footage of the incident, which was posted on the Daily Beast website.</p>
<p>Auger has lived in the Middle East for several years&#8212;working for the UN Refugee Agency in Damascus, Syria, and also as a freelance writer and videographer in the Middle East and Asia.</p>
<p>Her work has been published by CNN, Syria Today, and various UN publications, as well as in Out of Iraq by Sybella Wilkes, and The Iraqi Refugees: The New Crisis in the Middle East by Joseph Sassoon.</p>
<h2>Faculty stands up for experiential education programs</h2>
<p>Environmental Studies faculty members have stepped up to pool their resources and launch a fundraiser to protect the future of the department&#8217;s experiential education courses.</p>
<p>The department places more than 500 students in internships every year, offers labs and field trips in courses ranging from restoration ecology to environmental policy, and teaches popular field courses such as environmental interpretation and natural history field quarter.</p>
<p>Environmental Studies professor Brent Haddad helped start the campaign last year when he announced he would donate $1,000 toward preserving the department&#8217;s experiential education programs.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, state support to the campus has been cut by 22 percent, resulting in losses of teaching assistant and lecturer positions. Meanwhile, retiring faculty are not being replaced. At the same time, enrollments in Environmental Studies have grown by 50 percent.</p>
<p>So far the campaign has raised $70,000 in donations and pledges from more than 70 faculty members, alumni, and family of faculty and alumni, plus a $100,000 matching gift from an alumnus&#8217;s family foundation. For information, visit the Experiential Learning Endowment page at envs.ucsc.edu/support-us/endowment.html.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Open source&#8217; robotic surgery&#160;systems head to research labs</h2>
<p>Robotics experts at UC Santa Cruz and the University of Washington (UW) have completed the development, fabrication and integration of seven advanced robotic surgery systems for use by major medical research laboratories throughout the United States.</p>
<p>Five of the systems have been shipped to medical robotics researchers at Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Nebraska, UC Berkeley, and UCLA, while the other two systems will remain at UC Santa Cruz and UW.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided to follow an open-source model, because if all of these labs have a common research platform for doing robotic surgery, the whole field will be able to advance more quickly,&#8221; said Jacob Rosen, associate professor of computer engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UCSC and principal investigator on the project.</p>
<p>Eventually, all seven systems will be networked together over the Internet for collaborative experiments.</p>
<p>Robotic surgery has the potential to enable new, less-invasive surgical procedures as well as telesurgery, in which the surgeon operates a robotic system from a remote location.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f08bf68a8072704600d82ac2799f95ec"><name>review-chancellor-letter</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>From the Chancellor</title><start-date>1335340800000</start-date><display-name>From the Chancellor</display-name><path>/2012/04/review-chancellor-letter</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/review-chancellor-letter</link><created-by>ptownsen</created-by><created-on>1335475566125</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1336701424492</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>George Blumenthal</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Spirit of 'defiant optimism' must drive us</article-subhead><article-text><p>Here at UC Santa Cruz, we excel at working cooperatively toward shared goals, particularly goals that focus on social responsibility, environmental stewardship, and the common good. We are united by a spirit of &#8220;defiant optimism,&#8221; as UCSC Foundation Trustee Brandon Allgood put it recently.</p>
<p>For students, that spirit is evident in our commitment to hands-on learning. Nothing complements the challenging academic experience we offer in the classroom like the opportunity to &#8220;learn by doing.&#8221; We value student participation in research, internships, lab and field-study placements, creative endeavors, and independent as well as team projects.</p>
<p>These real-life experiences add depth and value to the education we offer students, whether they are preparing for a career or graduate study. On campus and off, in the local community and on the far side of the globe, learning in the real world is an integral part of the experience that transforms bright high school students into Banana Slugs&#8212;engaged and purposeful, prepared and determined to contribute to the greater good.</p>
<p>Today, the world needs Banana Slugs more than ever. One of the greatest challenges we face in this country hinges on our societal commitment to public higher education. The University of California is not alone in facing dire funding challenges as a result of severe cuts in state funding. Across the country, the budgets of public universities are being strained as states back away from their commitments to higher education. The federal government, too, is reviewing its role as a key provider of student support and research funding.</p>
<p>This threat to our national brain trust is emerging at precisely the same moment that countries in Asia and elsewhere are investing heavily in higher education. They know what we seem to have forgotten: Education is the path to personal fulfillment, upward mobility, and national prosperity.</p>
<p>I believe we are at a crossroads. At UC Santa Cruz, we&#8217;ve lost nearly $60 million in state funding in just five years. These cuts threaten the educational values we know make a difference in the lives of students. This fall, voters in California will have an opportunity to weigh in on these issues.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too early to know which proposals will qualify for the ballot, but one thing is clear: Without substantial new revenue for the state, the potential &#8220;trigger cuts&#8221; in Gov. Jerry Brown&#8217;s budget will result in an additional $13 million cut to our budget. As unthinkable as that scenario would be, it remains a likely outcome unless advocates of public higher education turn out on Election Day.</p>

<p><em>Ed. Note: The following letters were submitted in response to an article, &#8220;A revolt against humiliation,&#8221; that was written by faculty members Alan Richards and Edmund Burke. The article appeared in the spring 2011 issue.</em></p>
<p>Alan Richards&#8217;s and Edmund Burke&#8217;s distorted perspective on the turmoil in the Middle East was inappropriate for the Review. It was political opinion with gratuitous negative comments regarding Jews and Israel.</p>
<p>The professors rightly state that most Arabs despise their regimes because of corruption, but to claim that the revolt in Libya and Syria is linked to their regime&#8217;s support of Israel is ludicrous. In&#160;reality, many of the regimes used hatred against Israel to divert attention from their own corruption.</p>
<p>The professors claim we should be supporting Arab &#8220;democratic values,&#8221; but what they really mean is that the U.S. should drop its support for Israel and instead support diverse movements that have yet to demonstrate that they espouse liberal values such as sexual equality, religious tolerance, and a free press.</p>
<p>&#8212;Gil Stein, <em>Stevenson &#8216;71, Politics</em></p>
<p>I am no fan of the foolish endeavor to invade Iraq, nor am I an uncritical supporter of Israel or an uncritical viewer of American meddlings in other countries.</p>
<p>But the authors of this article fairly salivate their open disdain for American foreign policy by jumbling together sweeping shibboleths about the rapacious U.S. interventions in local conflicts around the world, with particular antipathy toward Israel.</p>
<p>They state for example, &#8220;Most fundamentally, however, most Arabs despise their regimes&#8212;for their corruption, nepotism, violence, and complicity in American and Israeli abuses of power.&#8221; Does Israel abuse its power? Sometimes it has, but surrounded for 60-plus years by incessant hostility from multiple enemies who frequently state the goal of obliterating the country&#8217;s existence, they could hardly be condemned in total because they sometimes make mistakes.</p>
<p>Further on, the authors refer to American profiteers who provide &#8220;... mindless support of unsustainable Israeli occupation policies.&#8221; The occupation of Arab lands by Israel is a thorny problem; sometimes Israel overreaches to ensure its self-preservation, but its occupation behaviors are born of random rocket attacks, terror-driven civilian bombings, suicide attacks, and even a Palestinian position that still denies in its textbooks that Israel even exists as a country.</p>

Critics chide academia over the sometimes esoteric nature of college studies, saying such topics have no bearing on real life&#8212;much less getting a job.</p>
<p>Okay, sure&#8212;my own days as an English major sometimes included stalking a fictional character, Leopold Bloom. Slouched in a big armchair in a funky, little-known library on campus, I swooned over the poetry of the Pilgrims and giggled at the antics described in Middle English in The Canterbury Tales.</p>
<p>But college is a time when students engage with their world rather than separate themselves from it. College courses, even on the most obscure subjects, give students critical thinking skills, writing practice, and insight into worlds, cultures, mindsets, history, people, etc., that they may never have encountered otherwise. They also encourage curiosity, foster engagement with other bright minds, provide challenges, build the soul, and help increase students&#8217; enjoyment of life and culture.</p>
<p>At UCSC, students pore over great books, but they also have a chance to &#8220;get their hands dirty&#8221;&#8212;whether they want to<br/>
stage a museum exhibition or take water samples at Younger Lagoon. It&#8217;s a place where engagement with the brain&#8212;and a broader engagement with the wider world&#8212;are complementary goals.</p>
<p>In this issue, you&#8217;ll learn about some of those real-world learning opportunities for UCSC students, including broadcasting via the campus&#8217;s beloved radio station, KZSC, which this year turns 45 (page 8); practical environmentalism and modern techniques for organic farming (page 12); and visualizing and explaining scientific concepts through art (page 16).</p>
<p>UCSC students understand the impact of an education here. They also appreciate how the campus became the learning-rich environment it is&#8212;because of the efforts of the founders and of the students who came before them. They are grateful to those who built the path, who created a place of unparalleled learning opportunity for students, and who give financially to ensure the student experience continues. Have a great summer, and we&#8217;ll see you in the fall.</p>

<p>Researchers at UCSC&#8217;s Environmental Studies Department and Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) will use the four-year grant from the U.S Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative to expand a network of farmers, researchers, UC Cooperative Extension personnel, and local nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>It builds on a project that began seven years ago to investigate ways to increase and improve organic production for the Central Coast&#8217;s high value strawberry and vegetable crops.</p>
<p>&#8220;This grant will allow us to greatly expand the network of farmers and researchers involved in improving organic production and to ask important questions about the environmental and economic performance of different organic production strategies,&#8221; says Carol Shennan, UCSC professor of Environmental Studies, who is leading the study.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f09c73398072704600d82ac23a6b2c6b"><name>review-hot-dates</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Hot dates</title><start-date>1335340800000</start-date><display-name>Hot dates</display-name><path>/2012/04/review-hot-dates</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/review-hot-dates</link><created-by>ptownsen</created-by><created-on>1335476646625</created-on><last-modified-by>ptownsen</last-modified-by><last-modified>1335476814622</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Commencement exercises</p>

radio station lets students explore
musical tastes, sports, and talk radio while also getting hands-on experience</article-subhead><article-text><p>In 1967, the year of the Summer of Love, a group of UCSC students started an FCC-unauthorized campus radio station that broadcast from a clammy basement and tried to use an&#160;upside-down garbage can as an antenna.</p>
<p>The broadcasters initially put egg cartons instead of acoustic tiles on the walls, and the disc jockeys played the psychedelic single, &#8220;Incense and Peppermints&#8221; by the Strawberry Alarm Clock, so many times the record cracked. They kept on playing it anyhow.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I left campus, [the station] was very shaky,&#8221; said Marc Okrand (Stevenson College &#8216;70, interdisciplinary studies), who went on to have a far-ranging career that included teaching linguistics at UC Santa Barbara, doing research for the Smithsonian and, most famously, developing the Klingon language for Star Trek&#8212;both for the movies and also for Star Trek spin-off TV shows.</p>
<p>Some years later, Okrand checked in to see how the station&#8212;originally called KRUZ&#8212;was doing. &#8220;I was surprised and pleased to hear it got itself together and became a big deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the station is turning 45, its broadcasting alumni are not only nostalgic but also grateful. In a world of corporate playlists and stations serving the same old warmed-over casserole dishes full of trendy singles and moldy oldies, KZSC (88.1 FM) continues to serve up platters you won&#8217;t find anywhere else, including an all-vinyl glam-rock show.</p>
<p>These days, the station occupies a redwood building that looks like the world&#8217;s biggest&#8212;and coolest&#8212;backyard tree fort. It boasts a 20,000-watt signal that covers Santa Cruz, San Benito, and Monterey counties and a theoretical listening audience of 2.5 million.&#160;It has been recognized with numerous awards, the most recent being a Top 5 College Radio Station designation by Huffington Post.&#160;On Radio Locator, a website with links to more than 10,000 radio stations, KZSC is listed as the &#8220;No. 1 most listened to college radio station.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also has produced a cadre of talented broadcasters who earned their stripes at the KZSC microphone and are now working in the industry: at the popular This American Life radio program, at the San Francisco Giants organization, and in the podcast world, among others.</p>
<p>With the same free spirit, KZSC now has a patina of practicality, which provides immersive training and resume-filling skills&#8212;something the first batch of broadcasters, huddled in their dank headquarters, might never have imagined.</p>
<h3>Strange days</h3>
<p>The original home for the radio station was in the basement of Dorm 2 at Stevenson College. The broadcasters ran afoul of the FCC when the signal began to interfere with a Monterey radio station that was trying to reach its listening base in Santa Cruz, according to early KZSC alumnus Okrand.</p>
<p>This impasse forced the broadcasters to go off the air for a time and return, briefly, as a &#8220;pirate&#8221; station before filing for a license and going legit.</p>
<p>In 1974, KRUZ began broadcasting under its current name&#8212;KZSC&#8212;calling itself the &#8220;tiny 10-watt titan.&#8221; The signal was so weak KZSC staffers printed up articles in their seasonal program guide, urging listeners to install simple wire antennas called &#8220;dipoles&#8221; in their dorm rooms to beef up the reception. A few fanatical listeners made their own antennas using $2 kits.</p>
<p>To get a sense of the radio station&#8217;s freaky past, all one has to do is to take a look at UCSC&#8217;s Special Collections, which houses multi-colored program guides dating back to 1970. These were days when the DJs grew forests of hair, and when a programmer named &#8220;The Cosmic Lady&#8217;&#8217; warned of humanity&#8217;s &#8220;ultimate self-destruction.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1980, the &#8220;10-watt titan&#8221; transformed into the &#8220;1,250-watt marvel,&#8221; four years after filing an application to the FCC. The radio station became a powerful presence not just on campus but in the community at large; for example, broadcasters provided live on-the-ground coverage of an enormous downtown protest against the bombing of Iraq in 1991.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, KZSC filled a critical role in UCSC emergency communications. Now, with the help of a backup generator shared with the UCSC Fire Department, KZSC continues to provide emergency information to the community, sending out alerts in situations ranging from regional AMBER Alert child abductions to chemical spills and wildfires.</p>
<p>KZSC got another power boost in 2002 with an upgraded 10,000-watt signal. Also in 2002, UCSC students passed Measure 4, which provided KZSC with one-time funding of $100,000 for much-needed renovations. This was the first time students directly contributed financially to their campus radio station. In 2007, the station went up to 20,000 watts.</p>
<h3>Still a throwback</h3>
<p>For all its changes, KZSC has stayed, strikingly, the same in many respects.</p>
<p>Even as they embrace digital technology&#8212;with a robust Web presence (www.kzsc.org), live streaming, and Facebook promotions&#8212;KZSC&#8217;s broadcasters have a vinyl fetish that never goes away.</p>
<p>If you walk into the station after climbing 19 tree-fort stairs, you will still see Leon Redbone&#8217;s inscrutable face on a poster from the 1980s. You&#8217;ll find astounding numbers of LPs stacked so high against the walls that DJs must zip around the storage area on a rolling ladder.</p>
<p>The young programmers cherish the long-playing records, especially the ones left over from the original KRUZ. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a nostalgia factor,&#8221; said Molly O&#8217;Reilly, 21 (College Nine &#8216;13, marine biology). &#8220;I grew up listening to vinyl. Part of it is rebellion against the digital age. Plus, vinyl just sounds better.&#8221;</p>
<p>KZSC&#8217;s vinyl library gives its young broadcasters an intimate connection with the past. KZSC&#8217;s student program director Tyler Wardwell, 24 (Kresge College, &#8216;12, American studies), immersed himself in the blues to prepare for his show. &#8220;I took out 20 records at a time and listened to every song,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fascinating to pull out the vinyl and see the original &#8220;KRUZ &#8220; stamp from when the station was still a pirate,&#8221; said student station manager Lauren Bell, 21 (Crown &#8216;12, literature). &#8220;You see the original date stamped on the record, and you think of all the songs that have been lost to memory, and all the people who played these songs before me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Future broadcasters may have their own nostalgia when it comes to current programming, which includes Tyler Wardwell&#8217;s &#8220;Dusty Finger$,&#8221; a blend of soul music from America and the African diaspora; a weekly David Bowie tribute show (&#8220;Dance Magic Dance,&#8221; Mondays at 1 p.m.); traditional blues (&#8220;Spoonful of Blues,&#8221; Sundays at 8:30 p.m.); a show with a focus on live music in Santa Cruz (&#8220;Coming to Town,&#8221; Fridays at 4 p.m.); followed by a weekly Slug Sports review (&#8220;Slug Talk&#8221; at 5 p.m.); a ska show (&#8220;Skallelujah,&#8221; Fridays at 8:30 p.m.); plus a few that are beyond description.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you call a show that blends field recordings of a neighbor&#8217;s chickens with the Sun Ra Arkestra, or 1970s self-meditation tapes mixed&#160;with&#160;synthesizers from the &#8217;90s?&#8221; asked Michael Bryant, who has been KZSC&#8217;s broadcast advisor for a decade.</p>
<h3>A &#8216;tactile learning&#160;experience&#8217;</h3>
<p>&#8220;Some people consider still doing your college radio show at 30 pathetic,&#8221; said radio personality Jesse Thorn, host and producer of the radio show and podcast Bullseye (formerly The Sound of Young America), which is distributed by Public Radio International. &#8220;I choose to see it as a career triumph.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thorn&#8217;s highly original broadcasting persona hasn&#8217;t changed much since his days at UCSC, even though his roster of high-profile guests now includes Stephen Colbert and David Wain (director of Wanderlust and the polarizing comedy hit Hot Wet American Summer).</p>
<p>His work ethic, combined with the live format, helped him create a template he still uses.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are writing a blog&#8212;which I do now, too&#8212;you can always just put off an entry,&#8221; said Thorn (Porter &#8217;03, American studies). &#8220;But when there is a live air slot staring you down, the only choices are to fill it with content or fill it with vamping, and there is nothing harder than vamping on the radio. It was the live element that really forced us to get good and get good quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Julie Snyder (Kresge &#8217;95, politics), a former KZSC news director and now a senior producer for This American Life, distributed by Public Radio International, loved the hands-on quality of the station. &#8220;I kind of lived there for four years,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you go to a university with a journalism program, the station is part of the journalism school,&#8221; Snyder said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t touch this, you can&#8217;t do that, you have to work your way up. At KZSC, you could do what you wanted on the air as long as you weren&#8217;t breaking FCC guidelines. I gained confidence from that. It was very helpful&#8212;to jump right in, to have access to the equipment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former Slug sports correspondent Justin Bercovich (College Nine, &#8217;08, American studies) went on to work for the San Francisco Giants.</p>
<p>Student broadcasters must take a five-unit Intro to Radio class, which fulfills their general education public service requirement, and provides not only hands-on training but also the history of the radio&#8217;s broadcast medium, FCC regulations and how KZSC fits into today&#8217;s mass communication spectrum. The current crop of UCSC broadcasters speak of the various skills they learned as well, from learning how to build up a Web presence to growing interpersonal skills, managing databases, learning how to build consensus, and overseeing other volunteers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a tactile learning experience,&#8221; said KZSC advisor Bryant.</p>
<h3>Anniversary plans</h3>
<p>KZSC&#8217;s anniversary is more than just a milestone for the campus and the radio station. It&#8217;s a sign that the analog world still has a place in our digital culture. There is something &#8220;hand-made&#8221; about the radio medium, where the broadcasts are live and the possibility of human error only adds to the excitement.</p>
<p>With an annual operating budget&#160;of about $80,000, KZSC receives no direct funding from UCSC. The station&#8217;s primary sources of income are from underwriting&#8212;educational radio/television&#8217;s equivalent of advertising&#8212;and listener donations.&#160;</p>
<p>KZSC plans to mark the anniversary throughout the year, with special programming and campus and community events. Bryant said he&#8217;d also love to send out a call to broadcasters from various phases of KZSC&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that be great to get the original cast of characters seated together in a dining room to tell their stories?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Preferably in a dining room close to a bar?&#8221;</p>

<p>Finding a fawn (baby deer) alone in the woods or a meadow is fairly common. Many people assume that young wildlife found alone are abandoned, helpless and need assistance for their survival. In nearly all cases this is a mistake, and typically human interaction does more damage than good. If you see a fawn or other newborn wildlife, enjoy your encounter, but for the animal&#8217;s well being, it is important to keep the encounter brief and maintain some distance.</p>
<p>A fawn's best chance of survival lies in being raised by its mother. Fawns nurse three to four times a day, usually for less than thirty minutes at a time, but otherwise the doe keeps her distance. This helps reduce the chances that she will attract a predator to the fawn. The fawn's protective coloration, near lack of scent and ability to remain motionless all help it avoid detection by predators and people.</p>
<p>If you find a fawn you should not approach it and by no means touch it or pick it up. The mother will most likely return to claim it. If you feel that the animal is in harms way, maintain a substantial distance while still being able to observe it and contact the <strong>campus police department 459-2231</strong> or <strong>county</strong> <strong>Animal Control: 831-454-7227.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to potentially harming a fawn, state and federal laws forbid possession of game and many non-game animals, so adopting newborn wildlife is usually illegal. If a fawn has been "rescued" when it shouldn't have been, it can often be released at the same location. Parents tend to remain in the area for at least a day, looking for the lost youngster.</p>

<br/>
Nottingham visited her late son's alma mater for the presentation of the first Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship. Zimmerman (Stevenson, '02, sociology), was killed in the January 8, 2011 shooting in Tucson that gravely wounded U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz. Also attending were Gabe's father, Ross Zimmerman and Pamela Golden, his stepmother. <br/>
<br/>
"Gabe would be honored to know Yethz&#233;ll has received this scholarship," Nottingham said, introducing Yethz&#233;ll D&#237;az, a UCSC senior with a double major in Latin American and Latino studies and sociology. <br/>
<br/>
"I plan to continue Gabe Zimmerman's legacy by pursuing issues I'm passionate about," said D&#237;az, from Bakersfield, who was joined at the Stevenson Fireside Lounge by her parents, sister, and young nephew.<br/>
<br/>
The $2,500 Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship was established to support undergraduate students in the Division of Social Sciences who are passionate about social issues and committed to public service. Two alums got it started within days of Zimmerman's death. One, Jonathan Klein (Merrill, '89, politics), attended the ceremony and moderated the discussion. <br/>
<br/>
The scholarship fund has since grown to an endowment of more than $90,000 from 800 donors. Social Sciences Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki said he hopes the fund will exceed $100,000 in order to provide for multiple scholarships.

<br/>
The ability to think critically, sift through competing facts, and make considered decisions linked the panelists' discussion that followed the presentation.&#160; Participating with Nottingham were NPR science correspondent Joe Palca (graduate division, '80, Ph.D. psychology), Anthony Sanchez (Stevenson, ' 02, history), Pamela Davis (College 8, '85, economics), and Carolyn Moore (Merrill, '92, psychology). <br/>
<br/>
"Having the critical thinking skills makes a difference in whatever you do," Nottingham said. Her 30 years in government work showed her that "what makes people the most happy is the feeling that they are making a difference," she said.<br/>
<br/>
Nottingham and Ross Zimmerman spoke of their son's love for helping Gifford's constituents as outreach director.&#160; Alec Arago, district director for Rep. Sam Farr, D-Monterey, recalled Ross Zimmerman considered his son "a constituent whisperer."<br/>
<br/>
Arago (Crown, '89, history) presented Zimmerman and Nottingham with copies of a congressional resolution honoring Gabe Zimmerman and the scholarship that will "support the work of Yethz&#233;ll D&#237;az and future students who are involved in helping average citizens improve their quality of life."<br/>
<br/>
"I learned at Santa Cruz how we in our chosen careers can make people's lives better," said Sanchez, who now teaches seventh grade history in Elk Grove. He and Zimmerman were friends since their second day at Stevenson College. Education is a fundamental place where we get to impact everyone," he said.<br/>
<br/>
Palca spoke of his time at UCSC and learning to "tell the truth and let people make their decisions based on the facts." Davis, who founded the Nonprofits' Insurance Alliance of California, told how she wanted to give something back after graduating as a reentry student with state support. She came up with the idea for the Careers with a Conscience discussion. <br/>
<br/>
Moore, director of the Self-Sufficiency Program at the Human Investment Project, in San Mateo, shared her experiences with helping women with housing while they pursue education or job skills. <br/>
<br/>
"When Gabe graduated," Nottingham said, "he was able to retain the idealism he learned here. He believed that individuals can make a difference."<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="05054d70807270460088ced327cca488"><name>mchenry-rededication</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>McHenry Rededication celebration attracts hundreds to newly renovated library</title><summary>Several hundred alumni, students, faculty, and community supporters joined University Librarian Ginny Steel and Chancellor Blumenthal last Friday for the official Rededication of McHenry Library. &#13;

<br/>
The ribbon-cutting ceremony took place on a crystal clear spring day overlooking the Library&#8217;s <strong>Mary Ackerknecht Reading Garden</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time coming,&#8221; noted Steel in her opening remarks. &#8220;There may be some people here who were not even born when planning began for the renovation of this building in 1993.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The Library is now the largest building on campus,&#8221; Steel added. &#8220;It&#8217;s usage has doubled and that&#8217;s the best measure of success. McHenry Library is truly the rejuvenated heart of the campus.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Named after UCSC&#8217;s</strong> founding chancellor, Dean McHenry, the library has served faculty and students since the very beginning of the campus.<br/>
<br/>
Now after six years of construction, plus a huge reorganization of its collections and services, the new McHenry today provides a state-of-the-art research, study, and instructional environment for the UCSC community.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s a library of the 21st century,&#8221; noted Chancellor Blumenthal.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We are particularly appreciative of our donors and private supporters, without them this project would never have happened,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>After the ribbon-cutting</strong> by the chancellor and UCSC alumnus Jessie Wilkie&#8212;a former library employee who also addressed the crowd&#8212;guests were treated to a wide variety of guided library tours and demonstrations.<br/>
<br/>
The open house included displays at <strong>Special Collections &amp; Archives</strong>, as well as demos of the latest digital techniques to preserve library materials.</p>
<p>Celebrations also took place at the new <strong>GLBTI Group Study Room</strong> with Deborah Abbott, the director of the GLBTI Cantu Center, and the <strong>Gloria Anzaldua Group Study Room</strong>, which featured an exhibit honoring the late author and UCSC faculty member, plus a program featuring feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker.<br/>
<br/>
An exhibit honoring author Laurie R. King, and her late husband--author and UCSC faculty member, Dr. Noel King--was also on display in the new <strong>Noel and Laurie King Group Study Room</strong>.<br/>

<p>Look no further than the 400 alumni who broke into a spirited performance of the Hokey Pokey during the Natural History Field Quarter reunion.</p>
<p>Or consider the woman from the class of 1972 who burst into the Cowell Dining Hall on Saturday and shouted, &#8220;Flashback!&#8221; at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people signed up for the reunion events, including more than 700 alumni, setting an attendance record. The events had a wide emotional range, with alumni laughing over long-dormant good memories, reconnecting with professors, and congratulating the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/04/careers-conscience.html">first winner of a scholarship</a> dedicated to the memory of alumnus Gabriel Zimmerman.</p>
<p>The Natural History Field Quarter was a huge presence on reunion weekend, in part because 2012 marks the field quarter's 40th anniversary. Over half of the alumni who returned to campus that weekend are directly associated with NHFQ. &#160;The Santa Cruz Sentinel and the San Jose Mercury News reported on the reunion event, in "<a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_20508722/ucsc-natural-history-field-quarter-alumni-gather-reunion">As UCSC Natural History Field Quarter alumni gather for reunion, program faces uncertain future</a>." The article discussed the work of Professors Kenneth Norris and Steven Gliessman. Alumni are also quoted in the article, recalling their adventures in Field Quarter and how the experience had influenced their lives and their career choices.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Close to tears</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it felt like a whole roomful of people was just about to burst into tears. Such was the case on Friday night during a heartfelt conversation between Oakes founding provost Herman Blake and emeritus writing lecturer Don Rothman, covering more than 40 years of intellectual and social history at UCSC, with a special emphasis on the Oakes community. During the presentation, grateful Slugs thanked Blake and Rothman for influencing their lives for the better with their intelligence, guidance and far-reaching empathy. <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/04/herman-blake-don-rothman-2012.html">Read the full story here.</a></p>
<p>One day later in the same venue&#8212;the Humanities Hall&#8212;the audience listened in fascination as a distinguished panel including renowned social psychologist Elliot Aronson, noted Feminist Studies professor Bettina Aptheker, assistant professor in computer engineering Gabriel Elkaim, professor of molecular biology Manuel Ares, and theater arts associate professor Kate Edmunds, shared some of their classroom secrets. <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/04/teaching-luminaries-at-academic-forum-2012.html">Read the full story here.</a></p>
<p>Alumni also took the time to explore the newly renovated McHenry Library, a state-of-the-art research and study hub that was rededicated during Alumni Weekend.</p>
<p>The three days were a time of reconnection. While sitting in the audience at one reunion event, John Dizikes, a professor emeritus of American studies, said he was heartened that some of his students from 1965 still remember him vividly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They felt that I&#8217;d encouraged them,&#8221; said Dizikes, who came to UCSC in 1965. A winner of the UCSC Alumni Association's Distinguished Teaching Award, Dizikes served as Cowell College provost, and mentored thousands of students during his career at UCSC. &#8220;And that was my primary function: to encourage them to do the best they could, and to find out they could do more than they thought they could, especially when they first arrived here and found themselves among so many bright people.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>From serious to silly</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, the atmosphere went from heartfelt and serious to endearingly silly.</p>
<p>In the Cowell quad, some normally staid alumni and current students were cajoled into <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ucscbananaslugs/sets/72157629549629566/">getting their pictures taken</a> while wearing Sammy the Slug fuzzy hats, feelers, buttons, and even a bright-yellow feather boa to demonstrate their abiding love for The Slug. Even Chancellor George Blumenthal was seen <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ucscbananaslugs/7122764497/in/set-72157629549629566">hamming it up in the photo booth</a>.</p>
<p>At the alumni lunch at Cowell, &#160;the dining hall experience led to unexpected memories. Janet Respess, (Cowell, &#8217;75, biology) remembered getting scared senseless almost 40 years ago when a bunch of UCSC students dressed up as zombies and emerged from the forest near the West Entrance after a screening of &#8220;Night of the Living Dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the dining hall, winemaker and Bonny Doon Vineyard founder Randall Grahm was smiling proudly as he poured Banana Slug Rousanne 2010 wine&#8212;which tasted deliciously of pear butter and was stylishly outfitted with a student-designed label.</p>
<p>Grahm chuckled when asked if he could ever envision such a moment&#8212;standing in front of his fellow Slugs and pouring wine from his own winery. &#8220;I had not a clue,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was just hoping I&#8217;d find my m&#233;tier. In those days we didn&#8217;t worry so much. We imagined the world would take care of us. Actually, it did.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Blast from the past</strong></p>
<p>Frank Zwart (Cowell, '71, mathematics), UCSC campus architect emeritus, recalled how that very morning, he was driving up to campus, listening to a &#8220;Talk of the Nation&#8221; podcast on his iPod. The broadcast got him thinking about all the technological changes that had transpired since he graduated.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his perspective shifted when he heard Roger McGuinn of the Byrds performing &#8220;My Back Pages,&#8221; a much-loved Bob Dylan song. &#160;&#8220;There I was, listening to a song I could have heard 40 years ago on campus,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was just too corny, too coincidental to be true. And it brought tears to my eyes.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="05976aa7807270460088ced39fda424f"><name>herman-blake-don-rothman-2012</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lasting friendship, enduring inspiration: J.

<p>Their talk, entitled &#8220;Rediscover: J. Herman Blake and Donald Rothman,&#8221; covered the importance of empathy, and the enduring multi-cultural vision that guided the creation and growth of Oakes.</p>
<p>These two old friends and former colleagues also spoke of the importance of &#8220;listening eloquently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake is often credited for his role in shaping the values and the strong multi-ethnic cross-disciplinary focus of Oakes College, and hailed for his classroom style, which is strongly rooted in Civil Rights history and old-fashioned storytelling prowess.</p>
<p>But he was quick to credit other people for influencing and guiding him along the way, naming such luminaries as Oakes co-founder Rafael Guzman, and Civil Rights leader Septima Clark, who mentored Blake and spent time at Oakes College.</p>
<p>Blake also spoke of historic forebears whose example offered comfort and encouragement in difficult times. To this day, Blake, who grew up in a poor family, makes sure to wear a fresh rose every time he lectures in a classroom. The flowers are worn in honor of George Washington Carver, a former slave who went on to be a groundbreaking botanist and scientist.</p>
<p>As a boy, Carver was traded by his slave owners in exchange for a horse&#8212;a fact that astounded Blake, especially considering Carver&#8217;s later fame and influence.&#160;&#160; &#8220;You cannot walk in the shadow of George Washington Carver and say something&#8217;s too hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake said Carver was among the people who made him realize that human beings are not intended to lay their burdens on others. &#8220;You try to heal the burden on someone else and tote it together.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the presentation, several people in the audience were reduced to tears when speaking of the way Blake influenced and in some cases transformed their lives.</p>
<p>Frances Henderson, (Oakes, &#8217;80, East Asian Studies/history) recalled how Blake made her promise to return to school at UCSC after she took a quarter off, in part because her father was ill. &#8220;Someone saw me crying, and he found out about it. He was very caring. As a provost he wore a mantel of power but he was very sweet and gentle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another former student, Gregory Brown, now a professor of criminal justice at Cal State Fullerton, remembers some wise words from Rothman many years ago: &#8220;He said the best writers are rewriters.&#8221; Rothman also told his classes that college students should aspire to write like themselves, finding their own voice instead of trying to mimic the voice of academia, Brown recalled.</p>
<p>While introducing Blake and Rothman, UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal&#8212;a founding faculty member at Oakes College remembered meeting both of them more than 40 years ago.</p>
<p>&#160;He praised Rothman&#8217;s ability to work well with different groups and his commitment to students, and credited Blake with a strong vision &#8220;and a will to do something different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both (Rothman and Blake) were crucial to the development of Oakes,&#8221; Blumenthal told the crowd. &#8220;Herman&#8217;s commitment was always to the students. He wanted a place where they could feel safe and comfortable and revel in their differences rather than demand similarities.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Blake also realized that something &#8220;more than comfort&#8221; was at stake, said Blumenthal, referring to Blake&#8217;s strong commitment to the teaching of sciences at Oakes.</p>
<p>The dialogue left a deep impression on Rothman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I witnessed the expression of more optimism, passion for education, and gratitude than I have ever seen on this campus or anywhere, for that matter,&#8221; Rothman said. &#8220;And I came away believing that our current students need even more opportunities to learn what is possible for them, even in a time of terrible economic retrenchment. This weekend, UCSC, and especially Oakes College on its 40 anniversary, revealed themselves to be centers of hopefulness&#160;and great antidotes to cynicism, which great universities should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>The large crowd that attended the Academic Forum at the Humanities Lecture Hall &#8212;one of the cornerstones of the UCSC Alumni Reunion Weekend&#8212;had a rare opportunity to hear these and other teaching secrets of renowned educators, ranging from social psychologist Elliot Aronson to noted feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker.</p>
<p>This candid dialogue emphasized the various ways a great teacher can motivate students, help them take ownership of their education and sharpen their analytical skills, without ever losing sense of their empathy and natural curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>Study your life</strong></p>
<p>Bettina Aptheker began with a line from the late poet Adrienne Rich:</p>
<p><em>No one ever told us we had to study our lives,<br/>
make of our lives a study, as if learning natural history<br/>
or music &#8230;</em></p>
<p>The line was an appropriate kick-off to her presentation, which emphasized the importance of students studying their own lives to help them analyze feminism, racism and colonialism. &#8220;I encourage students to critically experience and engage with their own lives&#8221; as a means of understanding and as a way to extend compassion to others, she said.</p>
<p>While urging students to develop their analytical thinking to take part in an "effective democracy," Aptheker also advised them &#8220;to do work you love, to come from a place of optimism. Embrace a tree. Chatter back to a raven. Kiss the horizon. Utopian? Hopeless? &#8230; I say Eden is a place in the mind. Envision it and make it so.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Rise of the robots</strong></p>
<p>Gabe Elkaim spoke with equal joy about a very different discipline&#8212;the building of robots&#8212;during a presentation about his unusual but highly effective teaching techniques. In his most popular class, Introduction to Mechatronics, 36 students spend 10 weeks building robots in teams of three, culminating with a class presentation with varying themes. One semester, students and their robots acted out the parts of bulls and toreadors. In another, a &#8220;Slugs of the Caribbean&#8221; theme had student navigating their robot &#8220;ships&#8221; to an enemy island and firing ping-pong balls at their foes.</p>
<p>One of his most enduring teaching lessons is &#8220;Fail early and often. In many ways, the class is Failure 101. You have no idea how to do it right before you start.&#8221;</p>
<p>The class is fun and grueling. &#8220;Toward the end, classmates barely sleep. They put their heart and soul into the robots. Sometimes they come to me and say, &#8216;it doesn&#8217;t work!&#8217; I say, &#8216;it&#8217;s OK. This is just an exercise, getting you to do something hard, beyond what you thought you could do.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Taking pride in scientific research</strong></p>
<p><em>Manuel Ares</em>, a professor of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology at UCSC, has his students go out into the field, isolate and identify phages, which are viruses that infect bacteria.</p>
<p>He channels their excitement of discovery into an impactful teaching experience&#8212;and turns them into teachers in the process. It&#8217;s thrilling for them to go out, gather some dirt and discover these phages out in the forest. Students determine functions of the phages&#8217; genes. They take ownership of the entire process. &#8220;They say, &#8216;this is my virus, and I want to find out how it works,&#8217;&#8221; Ares said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Research is indivisible from teaching,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As soon as you discover something, you&#8217;re going to tell somebody else about it. That makes you, instantly, a teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Genuine emotion, great theater</strong></p>
<p>Theater Arts professor Kate Edmunds repeated Elkaim&#8217;s assertion that failing early and failing often, can be healthy for students. Devoted artists, like devoted scientists, are engaged in a series of disciplines and repetitions. Students can learn what it is like to try, and fail, on a small scale before they go out in front of a trusting, paying crowd that has agreed to sit in a theater without windows and take in their performance, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to be really good at what you do to take up people&#8217;s time that way,&#8221; Edmunds said. &#8220;I tell students about scientists going into their labs knowing they won&#8217;t find the solution to a given problem in their lifetimes. Do you have the same dedication? &#8230; The moment you know what failed, you move a step ahead. Don&#8217;t throw away those failures. They may become helpful to you some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edmunds made Theater Arts sound like a challenging discipline but also emphasized the joy of creation, and the transcendent feeling students get when they channel something real and true into their craft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology changes, but what doesn&#8217;t change is this: We fall in love. We get our hearts broken. Our feet our pulled out from underneath us, and we experience great joy. Life is messy. Let&#8217;s take all that messiness, edit it down, show it in all its horrific beauty, put it on stage for two hours and do that eight times a week. That&#8217;s what poetry is.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Thinking and feeling in the classroom</strong></p>
<p>Renowned social psychologist Elliot Aronson, who taught at UCSC from 1974 to 1994, made quite an entrance to the forum, where he was accompanied by his dog, Desilu. Aronson, who suffers from macular degeneration, has lost most of his eyesight, but his presentation &#8211; about the intersection between analytical skills and empathy &#8211; was notably upbeat.</p>
<p>"I don&#8217;t have my eyesight, but I still have my vision,&#8221; he quipped.</p>
<p>On Friday, Aronson received the Distinguished Emeriti Award from the division of Social Sciences at a luncheon at the Seymour Center.</p>
<p>Aronson said that UCSC&#8217;s unique and intimate college system made his academic and intellectual life fascinating on campus. At Kresge College, there was a philosopher one office down from me. Two doors down was the sculptor Jack Zajac, and the creative writer Carter Wilson was just down the hall. It was just an enormous pleasure to be there.&#8221;</p>
<p>While some professors shy away from teaching intro courses, Aronson said he relished the chance to teach complex topics to young students just finding their way in college. One of his favorite exercises was inspired by Franz Kafka&#8217;s famous letter to his father, in which he gives his elder a detailed dressing down. Taking his cue from Kafka, Aronson asked his students to write a hypothetical letter one of their own parents, holding nothing back.</p>
<p>"If you have a bone to pick, or two, or three, or 20, write it down, but don&#8217;t give it to the parent. Give it to us." &#160;But here&#8217;s the rub. After students wrote that first letter, Aronson then made them sit down and write a letter from the perspective of the targeted parent. &#8220;There&#8217;s the empathy, there&#8217;s the compassion,&#8221; he said. "The critical ability allows them to nail that parent &#8230; but then they have to try and figure out what is going on in the parent&#8217;s life, the overpowering events that might explain the things you find objectionable."</p>
<p>"This assignment encapsulates what an educated person should be able to do," he said in closing.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="51999aeb8072704601391d27d553ce54"><name>women-of-influence</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Women of Influence awards recognize six with UCSC connections</title><summary>Faculty, staff, and alumni of UCSC accounted for six of the 100 women recognized by the Silicon Valley Business Journal as 2012 Women of Influence.</summary><keywords>Women of Influence, Claire Max, Angela Wray</keywords><start-date>1335427200000</start-date><display-name>Women of Influence</display-name><path>/2012/04/women-of-influence</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/04/women-of-influence</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1337103850121</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1337103977060</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/claire-max.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/claire-max.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>claire-max.jpg</name><display-name>claire-max.jpg</display-name><file-size>36294</file-size><width>200</width><height>232</height></image><image-alt>claire max</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/cover-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/cover-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cover-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22549</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>cover image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Claire Max</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/04/images/angela-wray.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/04/images/angela-wray.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>angela-wray.jpg</name><display-name>angela-wray.jpg</display-name><file-size>35539</file-size><width>200</width><height>234</height></image><image-alt>angela wray</image-alt><image-caption>Angela Wray</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Faculty, staff, and alumni of UC Santa Cruz accounted for six of the 100 women recognized by the <em>Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal</em> as 2012 Women of Influence in Silicon Valley.</p>
