<br/>
Featuring longtime UCSC music faculty member <strong>Patrice Maginnis</strong>, with Cabrillo College music chair <strong>Michele Rivard</strong>, UCSC alumna <strong>Sheila Willey</strong>, and Cabrillo music instructor and UCSC accompanist <strong>Michael McGushin</strong>, the show begins at 7:30 p.m. at UCSC&#8217;s Music Recital Hall.<br/>
<br/>
With songs ranging from Debussy to the McGuire Sisters to Suzanne Vega, the evening will include both solo and three-part arrangements of music running from the 18th century to the present.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It all started when I went to a Patti Lupone concert in Las Vegas,&#8221; said Maginnis.&#160; &#8220;She was singing everything from BeeGee songs to Victorian ditties back to back, creating this collision of genres. Since Michele, Sheila, Mickey and I have such a wide interest in vocal styles and repertoire, it was a natural fit.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;This will be our fourth concert,&#8221; she added.&#160; &#8220;We will be singing half trios and half solos from Monteverdi to Joni Mitchell. And Mickey will be singing lead on an arrangement of a Suzanne Vega&#160; song which he composed for this concert.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Maginnis has been on the faculty of UC Santa Cruz since fall of 1986, where she has taught voice, opera production, repertoire, and recital preparation. She has sung leading roles with Opera San Jose, Ensemble Parallele, the Santa Cruz County Symphony, New Music Works, the Santa Cruz Baroque Festival, and the Santa Cruz Chamber Players, and has performed and given master classes in Germany and Montreal.<br/>
<br/>
Maginnis is also a featured artist on many recordings, including the opera <em>Rapunzel</em> by Lou Harrison, in which she sang the title role. Other recordings include the music of Darius Milhaud, Eric Satie, Henry Cowell, and Germaine Tailleferre.<br/>
<br/>
Michele Rivard is chair of the Music Department at Cabrillo College, where she teaches classical and popular voice. Her vocal jazz quartet, Mainswing, has appeared at the Monterey Jazz Festival, Santa Cruz Jazz Festival, and Kuumbwa Jazz Center, and for 20 years she performed with, and was vocal coach, for Cabrillo Stage Summer Musical Theatre. She has also appeared with the Santa Cruz Symphony, Cabrillo Music Festival, New Music Works, and Trinity Chamber Orchestra.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Soprano Sheila Willey holds degrees from UC Santa Cruz and the Peabody Conservatory. Willey sang the role of Cunegonde in <em>Candide</em> with Cinnabar Opera Theatre and has appeared with the Santa Cruz Baroque Festival. She performed the role of the Contessa in UCSC&#8217;s production of <em>The Marriage of Figaro</em>, and has performed with the New Music Works ensemble, the Worn Chamber Ensemble and Ensemble Parall&#233;le.<br/>
<br/>
Michael McGushin is a music instructor at Cabrillo College and the coach/accompanist for the UCSC Music Department. He is the conductor of the chamber choir Ariose and of Cabrillo&#8217;s Westside Choir, and has served as music director for a number of theater and opera productions in the Santa Cruz area. As a pianist, he is a longtime member of the New Music Works Ensemble for which he also serves as an artistic advisor, and he has appeared with many performing groups in the Santa Cruz and Monterey County areas.<br/>

The backers hope the measure will spread to the rest of campus.&#160;</p>
<p>Last Spring Quarter, the "<span>Path to a Greener Stevenson" program, with help from the Campus Sustainability Internship Program,</span>&#160;piloted a plan to remove all paper towels from the residence halls at Stevenson.&#160;</p>
<p>Residents were given <a href="http://www.peopletowels.com/">&#8220;PeopleTowels,&#8221; reusable, eco-friendly hand towels</a>, as an alternative to single-use paper products. The Zero Waste Team, a group of dedicated students in &#8220;Path to a Greener Stevenson,&#8221; collaborated with Associate Vice Chancellor Sue Matthews, to get the project off the ground.&#160;</p>
<p>David Boyle (Stevenson, Environmental Studies and Economics &#8216;12), a lead student on the project, worked long hours with his group, doing intensive background research, before proposing the sustainability project. To prepare for the project, the Zero Waste Team spoke with custodians and monitored how many paper towels residence halls were currently using. They estimated that the campus dormitories throw away 101 tons of paper towels each year.</p>
<p>Participating students say the project is timely and effective. &#8220;Conservation and sustainability are part of the fabric of this university, and removing paper towels from residence hall restrooms is just the start of a larger movement toward sustainability,&#8221; Boyle said.</p>
<p>Building on their past successes, <a href="http://ucscsustainability.blogspot.com/2012/04/may-2012-sustainability-profile-paper.html">participants will hand out PeopleTowels to all incoming Stevenson students for the start of the new school year.</a>&#160;</p>
<p>Stevenson&#8217;s zero paper towel goal is just one example of the student-backed sustainability initiatives at UCSC, which aims to create a &#8220;zero-waste community&#8221; and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels by the year 2020.&#160;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1e4213fc80727046209cf7151f4e7980"><name>voter-registration</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Online Voter Registration at UCSC - Students</title><summary>Register before the deadline (October 22) and vote on November 6th. </summary><start-date>1349078400000</start-date><display-name>Online Voter Registration at UCSC </display-name><path>/2012/10/voter-registration</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/10/voter-registration</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1349127377868</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1349127377868</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>My name is Victor Velasco and I serve as the External Vice Chair under the Student Union Assembly, our campus wide undergraduate student government. I am excited to announce (to all students) that registering to vote just became easier last week when the California Secretary of State finally institutionalized online voter registration! This process has allowed the Student Union Assembly to partner with the University of California Student Association (UCSA), CALPIRG, and Rock the Vote to create an online portal to help register students that is available through <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.rockthevote.com/register/ucsa/">http://www.rockthevote.com/register/ucsa/</a>. <br/>
<br/>
The online application process resulted from legislation passed last year by state Sen. Leland Yee. Students from across the UC system actively advocated for online voter registration last year to ensure that student participation in elections increases and now the process is finally complete! To ensure registration security, the application, which will request date of birth and the last four digits of the applicant&#8217;s Social Security number, will be checked against your driver&#8217;s license or state identification card. If the application is successful, an electronic image of the applicant&#8217;s DMV signature will be added to the application at the end. However, if no signature is on file with the DMV, applicants will be required to print out the form and mail a completed version to the county elections office. <br/>
<br/>
Students should remember to list their university to help show which university is registering the most students to vote. Our goal this year is to register 4,000 people to vote by October 22, 2012 so we are hopeful that this process will help us achieve, if not surpass, our goal. We are working hard to register students, and to create a culture of voting and educate the student body on critical ballot initiatives that will impact all of our lives. <br/>
<br/>
Every year is a critical year for students as we struggle to survive in an environment that is rapidly divesting from public education and our futures. This election grants us all the opportunity to stand up for the things that matter most to us, and our communities. Whether we care most about college affordability, student resources, job opportunities after we graduate etc. we all must come together as a community of people to create a better change.

He will return to his own research in high-energy astrophysics as a faculty member in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
As vice chancellor, Bruce has overseen external contracts and grants, intellectual property and technology transfer, and campus compliance with regulations regarding research, education, and business processes. During his tenure, external funding for campus research has increased significantly.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank Bruce for his leadership and support of UCSC faculty and students. Chancellor Blumenthal and I appreciate his counsel. We are also grateful that Bruce has agreed to oversee an organizational assessment of the Office of Research that is part of this campus's ongoing commitment to ensure excellence in our academic support structures.<br/>
<br/>
Bruce came to UCSC in October 2006 from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, where he was associate director for science. An accomplished astronomer, Bruce was hired as vice chancellor and also accepted an appointment as a professor of astronomy and astrophysics. He is the author of more than 200 refereed publications, more than 100 papers delivered at scientific meetings, and dozens of other papers.<br/>
<br/>
The campus will conduct a nationwide recruitment to fill this key leadership position. Please join me in thanking Bruce for all that he has accomplished and for his continued service to UCSC even as he looks ahead to this new chapter.<br/>

The project addresses the technical, social, and economic aspects of community-scale renewable-energy microgrids.</p>
<p>"The issues of how to integrate renewable energy sources like wind and solar power with the existing electrical grid have not been fully explored. It's not just a technical problem, because the technical issues are coupled with the economics and sociology of how people use energy," said principal investigator Michael Isaacson, the Kapany Professor of electrical engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In addition to UC Santa Cruz, the primary partners in the program are UC Davis and two Danish institutions, Aalborg University and the Technical University of Denmark. Faculty at these institutions have worked together for several years on a renewable energy summer program that brought together U.S. and Danish students for hands-on, project-based learning in both countries. The new grant allows a significant expansion of this program.</p>
<p>"This grant is truly funding the energy of our future," said Congressman Sam Farr (D-Carmel). "In order for these microgrids to work, they must meet different needs for the communities they intend to serve. I am proud that the members of the UCSC program are taking this into account as they work with their Danish peers to create new forms of practical and renewable energy."</p>
<p>The core research efforts focus on integrating engineering design and deployment principles with sociological and behavioral aspects of energy use. The interdisciplinary research team includes faculty with a wide range of expertise, including experts in electrical engineering, computer engineering, politics, sociology, environmental studies, energy technology, chemical and materials engineering, and technology management.</p>
<p>"Each institution brings their own expertise, and we've been working together for several years," said Isaacson, who directs the Center for Sustainable Energy and Power Systems (CenSEPS) at UCSC. "The Danes are ahead of us in some aspects of renewable energy, especially with wind power, which they are implementing on a large scale. In this project, we want to look at small-scale renewable-energy microgrids that can serve a local community or transfer power back to the main grid."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has several renewable energy microgrid projects in different stages of planning and implementation, including the <a href="http://greenwharf.soe.ucsc.edu/">Green Wharf Coastal Energy Research Facility</a> at the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf and additional facilities planned for Hartnell College in Salinas and the Watsonville Water Resources Center. At UC Davis, the West Village Community Development is a mixed-use neighborhood project designed to use energy efficiency and renewable energy to achieve "zero net energy." These and other facilities in California and Denmark will be used as test beds for studying the technical and social aspects of small-scale microgrid systems.</p>
<p>Technical challenges include the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, and the need to match energy supply with variable demand. How to optimize a small-scale microgrid for local conditions and integrate it with the main power grid is a major focus of the project. Researchers will also investigate social and policy aspects of energy consumption and the willingness of communities to accept local development of renewable energy sources. "We don't want to develop technologies that will not have community acceptance," Isaacson explained.</p>
<p>At UCSC, for example, he will be working with Ronnie Lipschutz, professor of politics and a co-principal investigator on the grant, and others to study the willingness of consumers to change energy use behaviors and practices.</p>
<p>Integrated with the five-year research effort is a well-balanced educational program for undergraduates, graduate students, and professional development. The program will focus on sustainability engineering, renewable energy, and ecological design, and will include workforce development seminars for energy industry professionals. Participating faculty have already experimented with the use of videoconferencing systems to give students access to faculty at different institutions. Isaacson said they plan to develop jointly taught courses between UCSC and Denmark using advanced videoconferencing technology. The program will also continue the California-Denmark Summer School in renewable energy that has been conducted for four years, alternating between the two countries.</p>
<p>"This program allows us to significantly scale up what we've been doing on an ad hoc basis and get other institutions involved," Isaacson said. "Everyone knows we've got to be able to change the way we generate and use energy. Our emphasis is on community-scale microgrids, focusing on system optimization."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="276c2c3a807270460c7d6ff458a13155"><name>cyber-security</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Security awareness training offered as part of cyber security month</title><summary>October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month with the goal of raising awareness about the many technology-related threats we face each day, and to empower people to keep their online lives safe and secure.</summary><start-date>1349352000000</start-date><display-name>Cyber Security Month </display-name><path>/2012/10/cyber-security</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/10/cyber-security</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1349281131525</created-on><last-modified-by>jrburns</last-modified-by><last-modified>1349741129866</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month.

<br/>
What if you could create identical copies, enough for each student? That's exactly what UC Santa Cruz anthropology professor Alison Galloway is doing with her extensive bone collection.<br/>
<br/>
One of Galloway's past undergraduate students came up with the idea. Matthew C.S. Reid, who graduated a year ago, spent the past summer scanning Galloway's collection and "printing" 3-D copies of each of the more than 400 samples.<br/>
<br/>
Reid took Galloway's skeletal biology class in winter quarter 2011 when he got to thinking about how to make the bone fragments available to students. "I wanted to improve education for people like me," he remembers.<br/>
<br/>
"Bone fragments are pretty fragile, we can't let students handle them," Galloway says. But the study of forensic anthropology requires students and researchers to see how fragments fit together. Recreating, for instance, what a skull looked like before it was struck with a blow or bullet.<br/>
<br/>
Galloway said her forensic work sometimes requires gluing pieces together. Even that process changes the pieces. "We lose what's on the fragmented surface," she said.<br/>
<br/>
Reid had transferred from Laney College in Oakland with a dual interest in anthropology and computers &#8211; particularly 3-D modeling. Both interests came into play with what he calls "virtual anthropology. "It's the perfect marriage of osteology &#8211; the study of bones &#8211;and computers," he said.<br/>
<br/>
Reid and Galloway secured funding for the project this summer to scan and digitize the collection. The resulting ones and zeros create a variety of opportunities, Reid said. The optical scanner "shoots lasers and science comes out," he said.<br/>
<br/>
The process is tedious using a 3-D scanner connected to a Dell workstation. A heel bone might take a half hour to scan; a skull several hours. But the digital data allow for an infinite supply of precise, inexpensive three-dimensional copies, giving each student in subsequent classes a sample to study, work with, and even alter or destroy.<br/>
<br/>
"This way we can retain the original," said Galloway, who is also UCSC campus provost and executive vice chancellor. She is often called to testify in criminal cases. "We can do reconstruction on a print; we have the original and the print &#8211; both are available to the defense and prosecuting counsel in the case of a trial.<br/>
<br/>
UC Santa Cruz is one of the first universities in the U.S. to use the scanning and 3-D print technology to copy a anthropology collection. Galloway and Reid plan to make the information open source, posting it on the web so that other institutions and researchers can use it and even make copies of their own.<br/>
<br/>
Reid, who plans to apply to graduate school to further his work with 3-D scanning, is particularly interested in other data the technology allows. He's able to calculate highly accurate surface area and volume from the digitized samples, data that are practically impossible to measure otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Once Galloway's collection is cataloged digitally, Reid will move on to other collections.<br/>
<br/>
Galloway said she is happy with the project. "I was interested in having a library of images that students could use in the classroom. He was interested in the 3-D imaging. In an odd coincidence, two people came together with interests that meshed."<br/>
<br/>
"This is so cutting-edge," Reid said, "and UC Santa Cruz is doing it."<br/>

Held in conjunction with the California Native Plant Society, the sale opens early (from 10 a.m. to noon) for members of either organization. Memberships will be on sale at the gate.</p>
<p>There are limited quantities of many of the hard-to-propagate plants, so eager gardeners are advised to arrive early. Among the Arboretum's offerings will be the much sought-after Channel Island bush poppy <em>(Dendromecon harfordii).</em> Propagation of this California native was improved by an Arboretum volunteer who found an effective way to treat the seeds by burying them and burning duff near them in a specific sequence.</p>
<p><em>Grevillea petrophiloides</em> 'Big Bird' is a novelty with green and lavender flowers that wave in the breeze above the shrub. It reminded Arboretum director Brett Hall of a large emu- or peacock-like bird, with the shrub as the body and the flowers as tail feathers. Another Australian cultivar released this spring, <em>Tetratheca</em> 'Amethyst Eyes,' is suitable for small gardens and has a long blooming period. Other plants available at the sale include feathery <em>Phyllica plumosa</em> and South African proteas. There will be California native plants from the Channel Islands, Little Sur, Santa Cruz County, and Mendocino County.</p>
<p>Sales benefit student gardener interns who are working their way through college by tending the Arboretum. The horticultural sales and memberships also benefit the Arboretum's conservation, research, and education programs.</p>
<p>The sale features an unusual selection of native and non-native species chosen to thrive in local gardens. Many are drought tolerant. A complete list will be available on the <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">Arboretum's web site</a> by October 5, 2012. Fall is a good time for planting because roots can establish themselves during the rainy season, which makes for a stronger and healthier plant to withstand the dry summer.</p>
<p>In addition to plants with different textures and origins for your garden palette, there will be flowers and foliage in all colors, from silver to black, with a rainbow of floral colors in between. The sale will feature some dramatic and lesser-known members of the protea family: Australian banksias with large, bottlebrush-like flowers and South African leucadendrons with attractive colored foliage.</p>
<p>A variety of succulents from California, Mexico, and South Africa will also be available, including haworthias, which are also known as window plants because of their translucent leaves. Many succulents are perfect plants for dorm rooms as well as the home garden, according to the curators.</p>
<p>For more information about the sale, contact the UCSC Arboretum at (831) 427-2998 or visit the Arboretum's <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">web site</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/UCSCArboretum">Facebook page</a>. The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

project.</strong> <br/></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>&#8220;I often say</strong>, only partly facetiously, that I have the best job in Washington D.C.,&#8221; notes UC Santa Cruz alumna Rachel Goslins, executive director of the President&#8217;s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, an advisory committee to the White House on cultural issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get to work with the White House, policymakers at the highest level of government, the private sector, and our Committee members--an incredible group of artists, actors, dancers, musicians, scholars, businesspeople and philanthropists--on a daily basis. All in service of supporting the essential role of culture and the arts and humanities in our country. What's not to love?&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
That committee includes First Lady Michelle Obama, &#8220;the honorary and fairly active Chairperson,&#8221; as well as artists such as Chuck Close, YoYo Ma, Edward Norton, Jhumpa Lahiri and Forest Whitaker.<br/>
<br/>
They work primarily on special projects in the areas of arts and humanities education, cultural diplomacy and the creative economy, partnering with federal agencies like the U.S. Department of Education, the National Endowment for the Arts, U.S. Department of State, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Goslins has some</strong> impressive credentials. She graduated from UCSC in 1991 with Crown College Honors and a B.A. in Literature, and went on to receive her J.D. from the UCLA School of Law in 1995.<br/>
<br/>
After practicing law for seven years--first at a large law firm in New York and then as an international copyright attorney for the government--she decided to go back to school to study documentary film at NYU's School of Continuing Education.<br/>
<br/>
For the next eight years, she made documentary films and also worked in arts administration, helping to run a film festival and directing a project to get independent films onto on-line platforms for PBS and ITVS.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Goslins&#8217; current job</strong> came about when she was working with her husband on Barack Obama&#8217;s 2008 Presidential campaign. She noted that her husband had gone to law school with the President.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;During the campaign, my husband was working as an adviser on technology issues, and, while that's a great group of folks, I can only talk about the internet for so long,&#8221; said Goslins. &#8220;I found myself gravitating naturally to the arts policy group, an amazing bunch of people who were really thinking about the future of the arts in this country.&#8221; &#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Notably, President Obama was the only candidate in the race to have an Arts Policy Committee, and to put out a Platform Statement on the arts.&#8221; Goslins added. &#8220;After the election, when they were looking for someone to run the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities--which was created by President Reagan in 1982--I was fortunate enough to be asked to take on that job.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Goslins was originally</strong> drawn to UC Santa Cruz by the campus&#8217;s reputation in Marine Biology. &#8220;I had thought that I wanted to work on cetacean research and UCSC had one of the best programs in the country for that.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
But she soon realized that wasn&#8217;t exactly what she wanted, and headed off in a different direction, immersing herself in a wide variety of subjects and activities on campus.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I loved my time at UCSC,&#8221; said Goslins. &#160;&#8220;What a fantastic experience and a fantastic time to be there, both academically and personally. &#160;On one hand, I loved the political science, psychology and sociology classes I took over the years, and the atmosphere of activism and social purpose that permeated the campus. &#160;And on the other, I was captivated by the opportunities to explore my creative side.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
She soon began taking creative writing and literature classes, and became very active in the theater program.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;One of my absolute favorite parts of those years was being involved in Shakespeare Santa Cruz every summer, getting to work in production, development, and on-stage with some of the most talented, fun and completely demented people I have ever met,&#8221; Goslins noted. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;So in a lot of ways, UCSC really prepared me for everything I have done since, allowing me to develop my intellectual and professional capabilities while also providing a great platform to explore my passion for the arts and creativity.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Goslins said she</strong> has had the opportunity to meet with President Obama on a number of occasions during her time in Washington. But her favorite memory is probably the meeting she had with the President and White House senior staff in the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing, right after her committee had published a major report:&#160;<em>Reinvesting in Arts Education: &#160;Winning Our Future Through Creative Schools</em>.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I remember we were all chatting as a group as we waited for him to come into the meeting, and I was in the middle of a sentence when the connecting door to the Oval Office opened, and he walked in,&#8221; Goslins recalled. &#160;&#8220;Boy, can that man occupy a room. He stayed for quite a while and then had to go to another meeting. &#160;After he left, the room was silent for a moment, and I heard myself saying, &#8216;Well, that's clearly the most important person I've ever been interrupted by.&#8217;"<br/>

<p>On September 20, this inviting, student-run nightspot, formerly known as Caf&#233; Revoluci&#243;n, was rededicated as the Terry Freitas Caf&#233;, commemorating an inspirational young alumnus who died while helping an indigenous people maintain its ancient culture.</p>
<p>Terry Freitas's grandparents, Ethel Shelley and the late Dr. J. Joseph Shelley, made the rededication possible with a generous gift to Colleges Nine and Ten.</p>
<p>"I am so fortunate to have a family of movers and doers&#8212;a wonderful, giving family," Ethel Shelley said before the ceremony, which drew a standing-room-only crowd of 85 people to the caf&#233;.</p>
<p>The space is stylish and comfortable, with burnished red, green, and white walls and chairs that invite hours of study, discussion, and contemplation. The donation establishes the first permanent endowments for both colleges, and will provide an array of student support.</p>
<p>In addition, this campus hotspot was refurbished and will be able to expand its hours of operation to include daytime service. Previously, it was only open from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.</p>
<p>The renamed caf&#233; will reflect the themes of College Nine (international and global perspectives) and College Ten (social justice and community) while presenting a range of music, spoken word, and artistic programs.</p>
<p>Helen Shapiro, provost of colleges Nine and Ten, said the cafe reflects the values of both colleges and honors the life of an idealistic young man who followed his passions and his political consciousness. &#8220;We are here to honor his legacy,&#8221; she said.&#160;&#8220;We appreciate this opportunity to inspire future generations of UCSC students to carry on his work.&#8221;</p>
<p>UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal said the gift is special for UCSC because it ensures that students will know about the life and work of Terry Freitas for many years to come.</p>
<p>Freitas (Crown '97, biology, environmental studies) traveled to Colombia to work closely with the U'wa people. At the time, oil companies were threatening U'wa land with mineral extraction and development.</p>
<p>After building a strong, sensitive, and trusting relationship with the U'wa over five years, Freitas helped set up the U'wa Defense Working Group while organizing to stop drilling on U'wa lands.</p>
<p>His life and work were soon cut short. In 1999, armed assailants kidnapped Freitas and two colleagues while they were heading toward a Colombian airport, where they planned to catch a plane for the United States. The revolutionary FARC group admitted the killings but called them a mistake. Freitas was 24 at the time of his death.</p>
<p>Terry's mother, Julie Freitas, a doula and a childbirth educator, reflected on her son's bravery and compassion.</p>
<p>"He was among the many UCSC graduates who dedicated their lives to doing things that seem extraordinary. How bright, how courageous," she said. "'I couldn't do that,' you may think. But every day presents opportunities."</p>
<p>She spoke of the great things good people can do by small interventions and acts of kindness that may seem insignificant but have far-ranging impacts.</p>
<p>UCSC environmental studies professor Daniel Press worked closely with Freitas, and had him as a student in a policy course and a writing class he taught with environmental studies lecturer Sarah Rabkin.</p>
<p>"While Terry was here at UCSC and afterward, he was modeling a way to be a good man," Press said. "Not a hero or a martyr or the embodiment of some Spartan ideal. Terry had a precocious and especially keen sense of empathy and responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Terry's desire to help others could drive him to take on ambitious projects, but it also brought about smaller gestures.</p>
<p>Once, when Press was a new father and had been up most of the night attending to his infant daughter, Terry noticed his exhaustion and gave Press a homemade mug to "perk him up." To this day it sits in a place of honor in Press's office.</p>
<p>"He understood that the world is hurt, and in great need of healing," Press said. "He was a very bright man, with many skills, but it was all tempered by this wonderful and humble character."</p>
<p>During the ceremony, Melina Selverston Scher (Merrill '89, sociology), an author and advocate for environmental causes and the rights of indigenous peoples, drew a strong connection between the caf&#233; sustaining Terry's name for generations, and the U'wa keeping Terry Freitas's name alive.</p>
<p>"They don't have a written history. They have an oral history. They sing their history, and Terry is in the song," she said.</p>
<p>Scher also told the crowd that Terry continues to live on in the songs of the U'wa people he loved. She spoke of the way he reached out to a people "that needed to not be alone. It's hard to do that. I think UCSC is special because it teaches us that. In this world of fame, of making as much money as you can, we are taught to be part of the world and take responsibility for part of the world."</p>
<p>In closing, she said, "I don't know if you know this, but Terry won. The U'wa won. There is no Shell Oil in the U'wa territories right now &#8230; his short, deep life changed the world."</p>

<p>Published as part of the Times Higher Education (THE) <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2012-13/world-ranking">World University Rankings 2012-13</a>, the analysis, conducted by Thomson Reuters, measured overall research influence based on the average number of citations per paper, using a database of more than 50 million citations to 6 million journal articles published over five years, from 2006 to 2010.</p>
<p>With a citation score of 99.9, UC Santa Cruz has the same score as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is surpassed only by Rice University, with a score of 100. Other institutions with high citation scores were Princeton University at 99.8 and the California Institute of Technology at 99.7. UCSC's score of 99.9 is unchanged from the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/10/world-university-rankings.html">previous year's rankings</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted but not surprised by this latest affirmation of the impact of UCSC faculty research," said Bruce Margon, vice chancellor for research. "Our campus is 'small' only in size, not in influence on world knowledge, and this type of analysis--how often UCSC discoveries are cited and used by others--is exactly&#160; the right way to judge the significance of our faculty's research. Our students benefit tremendously from being taught in an intimate setting by internationally recognized creators of knowledge."</p>
<p>In describing their <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2012-13/world-ranking/region/north-america/methodology">methodology</a>, THE editors called the evaluation of research influence their "flagship" indicator. As explained on the web site for the World University Rankings, "The citations help show us how much each university is contributing to the sum of human knowledge: they tell us whose research has stood out, has been picked up and built on by other scholars and, most importantly, has been shared around the global scholarly community to push further the boundaries of our collective understanding, irrespective of discipline."</p>
<p>UCSC's overall ranking in the THE World University Rankings for 2012-13 was 122nd. It is one of eight UC campuses among the top 200 universities worldwide.</p>
<p>In the overall rankings by subject, UC Santa Cruz was among the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2012-13/subject-ranking/subject/physical-sciences">top 50 universities in the physical sciences</a> (ranked 48th worldwide).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="327bb84380727046557ed9532e120bbc"><name>galloway</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CP/EVC Galloway explains forensic sciences to high school students</title><summary>In a talk at Scotts Valley High School Thursday night (October 4), Alison Galloway,  UC Santa Cruz campus provost and executive vice chancellor, described how scientists assist in homicide investigations. </summary><keywords>uc, ucsc. uc santa cruz, social sciences, anthropology, alison galloway, forensic sciences, homicide, investigation</keywords><start-date>1349424000000</start-date><display-name>Alison Galloway</display-name><path>/2012/10/galloway</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/10/galloway</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1349466699792</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1349467120462</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Anthropology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>UCSC Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>In a talk at Scotts Valley High School Thursday night (October 4), Alison Galloway,&#160; UC Santa Cruz campus provost and executive vice chancellor, described how scientists assist in homicide investigations. <br/>
<br/>
Galloway, a renowned forensic anthropologist, told students how her work and the work of others can help investigators determine the identity of homicide victims and the manner in which they were killed. <br/>
<br/>
Galloway's appearance was covered by the <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em>. The article can be found <a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_21703466">here</a>. <br/>
<br/>
About 100 students and their parents attended the talk, which was part of the high school's sixth International Baccalaureate Science night. Her speech was followed by informal student presentations of their own three-week look into forensic sciences.<br/>
<br/>
Galloway is frequently called to aid in police investigations and later testify at criminal trials. <br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_21703466</url><title>Santa Cruz Sentinel article</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/10/virtual-anthropology.html</url><title>Article on scanning Galloway's bone collection</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4141d1f7807270460c4565c455e5d408"><name>election-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Election forum October 22 explores what's at stake for California </title><summary>A forum on the November election and what's at stake for California will take place Monday, October 22, from 7:30 - 9:30 p.m. at the multipurpose room of Colleges Nine and Ten on the UCSC campus.

<br/>
The <em>Dallas Morning News</em> noted: &#8220;Grande grabs your heart and strums music on it.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
And <em>The Washington Independent Review of Book</em>s observed: &#8220;This book would be fabulous required reading for college freshmen--or even better, for freshman members of Congress.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
After two acclaimed novels about the Mexican immigrant experience, Reyna Grande is now celebrating the release of her new memoir--<em>The Distance Between U</em>s--with a reading and Q &amp; A at Bookshop Santa Cruz on October 14.<br/>
<br/>
Admission is free.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The UC Santa Cruz alumna</strong> (creative writing, film &amp; video &#8217;99) received an American Book award in 2007 for her debut novel, <em>Across a Hundred Mountains</em>.<br/>
<br/>
She wrote the first 80 pages of that novel--a poignant story about immigration and family based on her own personal experience--as part of her senior project in the UCSC Literature Department.<br/>
<br/>
Grande explained why she decided to write a memoir.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Even though my first novel was inspired by my own experiences, it was mostly a fictionalized story,&#8221; she noted.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I had been wanting to write a memoir for a long time, and as a matter of fact, my first novel was my &#8216;failed attempt&#8217; at writing the memoir. I turned that book into fiction because it was too painful to relive the hardest moments of my life.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Grande&#8217;s aim in the memoir is for readers to understand the complexity of immigration--an important issue that she says often gets pushed aside in favor of other issues that aren&#8217;t as controversial, or are easier to address.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I want people to gain an insight into what is lost and gained when an immigrant leaves his country in pursuit of a better life,&#8221; said Grande. &#8220;Like in my family's case, immigration turned parents and children into strangers.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;But it also allowed me to go from being born in a shack in Mexico to getting an MFA in the U.S. and getting published by one of the biggest publishers in the country,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Immigration is a conundrum. You are damned if you do, and damned if you don't.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Grande grew up in extreme poverty</strong> in rural Mexico. She was only two when her father left Mexico to look for work in the U.S. Her mother followed two years later, leaving Grande behind in Mexico. In 1985, when she was almost 10, Grande crossed the border as an undocumented immigrant.<br/>
<br/>
Now a U.S. citizen, Grande said that she would especially like to see lawmakers address the DREAM Act.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I identify so much with young undocumented child immigrants because I came to the U.S. as one myself,&#8221; says Grande. &#8220;I also spent years worrying about my legal status, fearing deportation. But unlike the DREAMers, I came to the U.S. at a time when something wonderful happened--the amnesty of 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which allowed almost 3 million people, including both my parents, to legalize their status.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;When I got my green card I felt the whole world open up to me,&#8221; she added. &#8220;And now I am paying back everything this country has given me, and I will continue to do so until the day I die.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>In addition to her writing</strong>, Grande takes an active role in promoting Latino literature and was program coordinator for the 2009 and 2010 Latino Book &amp; Family Festival&#8212;the largest gathering of Latino authors in the country. She also teaches creative writing workshops and speaks at high schools, colleges and universities across the country.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Michelle Obama said in her speech at the national convention that when you go through the door of success you don't shut the door,&#8221; Grande noted. &#8220;You leave the door wide open for those coming behind you. My writing workshops and the speaking I do at schools is my way of leaving the door open.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Now living in Los Angeles, Grande said she always looks forward to coming back to Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;This is the place that helped me to become the woman I am today,&#8221; said Grande. &#8220;The memoir ends on my very first day at UC Santa Cruz. Anyone who reads it will know what getting to Santa Cruz meant to me, and everything I had to overcome to get here.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Santa Cruz became my refuge, and it was the place that helped me to heal,&#8221; she added.</p>

researchers</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz biomolecular engineer Joshua Stuart is a principal member of a new "Dream Team" of cancer researchers working to develop personalized treatments for advanced prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C) and the Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF), along with the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), have announced a $10 million, three-year grant to fund the new project, which aims to overcome the treatment resistance that can develop in advanced prostate cancer. It is the second SU2C Dream Team project dedicated to prostate cancer research. UCSC researchers are also involved in an ongoing SU2C Dream Team project on breast cancer.</p>
<p>Stuart, an associate professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering, will lead a small team of UCSC researchers working on key aspects of the prostate cancer project. One of their responsibilities is to identify genetic pathways in prostate cancer cells that are involved in the development of treatment resistance. They will also be looking for potential drug targets within the networks of molecular interactions involved in resistance. Cancer genomics tools developed at UCSC are crucial to this work, which will ultimately allow doctors to identify the causes of resistance in individual patients so that treatment can be tailored based on the genetic signature of each patient's tumor.</p>
<p>A second component of the UCSC team's work will be to develop a novel application called MedBook to connect patients, doctors, and researchers. Inspired by social media, MedBook is the brainchild of UCSC graduate student, Foundation trustee, and former Apple executive <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/02/goldstein-profile.html">Ted Goldstein</a>, who has described it as a "Facebook for cancer." The idea is to bring together the findings from patient tumor samples and connect researchers in a way that will help them work collaboratively to discover new models of disease and match patients with targeted treatments.</p>
<p>"The precision prostate oncology MedBook will act like an iPad app, linking patients, doctors, and researchers in a participatory information platform that will speed the matching of new medicines targeted at new druggable pathways to the patients who will benefit most," said Jonathan Simons, M.D., president and CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation.</p>
<p>UCSC researchers led by Nader Pourmand, associate professor of biomolecular engineering, will also be involved in sequencing the RNA from prostate cancer samples.</p>
<p>Overall leadership for the new Dream Team is provided by Eric J. Small, M.D., professor of medicine and urology and chief of the division of hematology and oncology at UCSF, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator Owen N. Witte, M.D., distinguished professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at UCLA. Also involved are scientists at UC Davis, Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland, and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death for men in the United States. According to the Prostate Cancer Foundation, one man dies every 18 minutes from this disease and a new case occurs every 2.1 minutes. More than 2 million American men are living with prostate cancer and more than 16 million men are affected worldwide.</p>
<p>The SU2C Dream Team will explore the idea that resistance is a result of the prostate cancer cells using common cellular responses, called adaptive pathways, to escape current therapies. The team believes that by identifying these pathways and inhibiting them, they will be able to overcome treatment resistance and profoundly improve survival and quality of life for these patients.</p>
<p>The Dream Team proposes to centralize and integrate the considerable amount of data generated by their work into MedBook, which will use a simple social media concept to support information exchange and discussion. The centralized information will be updated continuously based on new data, and it will contribute to the development of molecular disease models that codify the most current clinically actionable adaptive pathways in metastatic treatment-resistant prostate cancer. This information will be instrumental to the team's clinical working group for recruiting patients to specific trials.</p>
<p>The project is estimated to start later this fall, with the first clinical trials scheduled to open in 2013.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4729654b807270466fbf1be26de62851"><name>ed-green-pbs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Professor Richard “Ed” Green will be featured on PBS science show </title><summary>Season premiere of NOVA scienceNOW featuring UCSC professor will air at 10 p.m. October 10 on PBS station KQED Channel 9.  &#13;

Alumni giving nearly tripled -- from $2.5 million to $7.3 million, and alumni giving increased from 11 percent of the total to 30 percent.</p>
<p>Gifts of $100,000 or more increased to more than $15 million. Over the past two years, private giving has increased almost 20 percent, with donors responding enthusiastically to campus fundraising efforts.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s been my experience that people give money for what they&#8217;re passionate about, and we are fortunate our campus offers so many inspiring reasons to give,&#8221; UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal said.<br/>
<br/>
Philanthropic highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A $2 million pledge from Steve Bruce (Cowell, &#8216;79, economics) and his wife Mona that will support several campus priorities, including $1.35 million for the <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/games-and-playable-media">Center for Games and Playable Media</a> and $250,000 each to the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/09/mark-bruce-fellowship.html">Mark Bruce Fellowship in Science and Math</a> and the writing program for Colleges Nine and Ten.</li>
<li>A $1 million pledge from Christine (Oakes, biology, &#8217;90) and Robert Holo (Crown, &#8217;87, history) of New York City that will help fund a new education wing at the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/08/holo-gift.html">Center for Ocean Health</a>, Long Marine Laboratory.</li>
<li>A $1 million gift from the Webster Family Foundation will initiate a plan to rebuild the 19th century hay barn -- part of the <a href="http://limeworks.ucsc.edu/">Cowell Lime Works Historic District</a>.</li>
<li>A $1 million gift from the Bernard Osher Foundation has created an endowment to support the <a href="http://ucsc-osher.wikispaces.com/">Osher Lifelong Learning Institute</a> at UCSC.</li>
</ul>
Other notable gifts include:<br/>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/01/sikh-gift.html">Guru Nanak Heritage Fund for Sikh and Punjabi Studies</a> -- a $247,000 gift from the Bay Area Sikh and Punjabi community -- will focus on academic research in Sikh culture and faith, Sikhs in North America, and Punjabi cultural heritage and language.</li>
<li>Dr. J. Joseph and Ethel Shelley donated $200,000 in memory of their grandson, Terence "Terry" Freitas (Crown '97, biology, environmental studies). A passionate and talented leader, Terry was murdered in 1999 at the age of 24 while performing educational and social justice work in Colombia. The university dedicated the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/10/freitas-cafe-rededication.html">Terry Freitas Caf&#233;</a> in his honor, and is using the funds to create the first permanent endowments for both Colleges Nine and Ten.</li>
<li>Emmy-nominated television producer <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/features/featured-donor/brannon-braga">Brannon Braga</a> (Crown, &#8216;90)&#8212;&#8220;Star Trek the Next Generation&#8221; and &#8220;Terra Nova&#8221;&#8212;pledged $100,000 to the Arts Excellence Fund.</li>
</ul>
The Class of 2012 established its legacy at UC Santa Cruz by raising almost $10,000 for the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/09/banana-slugs-give-back.html">Senior Legacy Fund</a>. Class members used these funds to distribute $2,500 scholarships to three students who exemplify the four tenets of S.L.U.G life&#8212;Spirit, Legacy, Unity, and Giving.<br/>
<br/>
A substantial $11.1 million, not included in the overall giving total, was pledged in planned gifts -- an increase of $3.8 million from last year. Most of these commitments were from alumni and included a $5 million bequest intention, the largest ever. In addition, four donors made irrevocable gifts totaling $190,000 and four bequests were realized adding nearly $300,000 to current gift totals. <br/>
<br/>
Donors are not the only ones recognizing UCSC this year.&#160; <em>Times Higher Education ranked</em> UCSC 7th in the world for best universities under 50 years old. The <em>Princeton Review</em> named UCSC a top best-value public university nationwide, a top sustainable university in California, and among the top 10 in the nation for its graduate programs in game design. UCSC ranked first in the world among younger universities in the key citation index that measures the influence of an institution's research.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Looking ahead to our 50th anniversary in 2015, I know private support will play an ever-greater role in our ability to realize our ambitions and broaden our impact,&#8221; Chancellor Blumenthal said. &#8220;UCSC graduates are an essential part of the well-educated workforce California needs.&#8221; <br/>

<p>"I thought, I'm a chemist. I should be able to do something about this," said Braslau, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Now her lab has developed a spray that can be used to detect urushiol on clothes and equipment, and potentially on skin, allowing people to wash off the oil before it causes an itchy, blistering skin rash. Exposure to tiny amounts of urushiol is enough to cause this allergic reaction in susceptible people, and about 70 percent of U.S. adults are clinically allergic to urushiol or would become allergic if exposed enough times. Although Braslau doesn't think there are toxicity concerns with any of the components of the spray, toxicology tests would be required before it could be approved for use on the skin.</p>
<p>"Of course, it would be great if we could deactivate the oil, but just being able to see it is useful because then you can wash it off," she said. "People can keep getting exposed from items with the oil on them. About ten percent of firefighters have to take time off work due to poison oak, and some of that is from exposure to oil that gets on their equipment."</p>
<p>Braslau's team described their spray in a <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo301135m">paper</a> published by the <em>Journal of Organic Chemistry</em> (online August 2012; in print January 2013). The spray reacts with urushiol to produce a fluorescent glow detectable under an ultraviolet "black light."</p>
<p>Chemically, urushiol belongs to a class of compounds known as catechols, which have a characteristic ring structure. Urushiol has a long greasy tail or "sidechain" attached to the ring, and different mixtures of urushiols with slightly different sidechains are found in the various <em>Toxicodendron</em> species. Braslau's spray detects the catechol ring structure. It contains a mixture of compounds, including a "profluorescent" compound in which the fluorescence of a dye molecule is quenched, and reaction with urushiol allows the dye to light up.</p>
<p>The formula has been patented, but Braslau said more work is needed to make it into a marketable product. She is also interested in developing it into a technique to detect catecholamines, which include physiologically important molecules such as dopamine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>Braslau's work on this project has not been funded by any major grants, aside from a small starter grant from UCSC. Her lab is continuing to do some work on it, mostly experimenting with different dyes. Developing it into a commercial product, however, will require an investor willing to fund additional research, she said.</p>
<p>"I do hope it will be available some day, because poison oak causes a lot of suffering. I've had really bad cases myself, and it has a big impact on people who work outdoors," she said.</p>
<p>Workers' compensation data, for example, indicate that poison oak accounts for more than 10 percent of lost-time injuries in the U.S. Forest Service.</p>
<p>In addition to Braslau, UCSC undergraduate Erin Lilie and graduate students Frank Rivera III and MariEllen Cottman contributed to this research and are coauthors of the paper.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4bbe99e2807270460a26cd3bfb2f415f"><name>2012-campus-curtailment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Winter Campus Curtailment 2012-2013</title><summary>Our 2012-2013 Winter Campus Curtailment is scheduled for the time period of December 22, 2012 through January 1, 2013.</summary><start-date>1349856000000</start-date><display-name>Winter Campus Curtailment </display-name><path>/2012/10/2012-campus-curtailment</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/10/2012-campus-curtailment</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1349890513329</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1349890513329</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>Our 2012-2013 Winter Campus Curtailment is scheduled for the time period of December 22, 2012 through January 1, 2013.<br/>
</span> 
<ul>
<li><span>&#160;&#160;&#160; December 24, 25, 31 and January 1 are paid university holidays (if eligibility criteria are met)</span></li>
<li><span>&#160;&#160;&#160; December 26, 27 and 28 are not paid university holidays</span></li>
</ul>
<span>These curtailment days may result in employees using vacation, accrued compensatory time off, or leave without pay for December 26, 27 and 28, 2012. For employees who may not have sufficient accumulated vacation, up to three (3) days of vacation leave may be used in advance of actual accruals during the campus curtailment period. In addition, those employees who are normally required to wait six (6) months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their accrued vacation hours even if the required waiting period has not been completed.<br/>
<br/>
 Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during campus curtailment.<br/>
<br/>
 Units planning to maintain operations as usual during the campus curtailment period must receive approval from their respective Principal Officer or designee and should refer to the &#8220;Exceptions to Campus Closure&#8221; memo that will be forthcoming from Physical Plant. This memo will explain the required procedure to ensure that heat is supplied to appropriate working areas.<br/>

<br/>
Richard Hughey, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education, and Michelle Whittingham, associate vice chancellor of enrollment management, will explain UC's application requirements and emphasize that there is a place at UC for any qualified California high school student who wants to attend.<br/>
<br/>
UC President Mark Yudof and senior officials from each UC campus including most chancellors will visit local high schools beginning October 18 as part of Achieve UC.<br/>
<br/>
The idea: Inspire students to aim for college, and arm them with the information they need to get there. The message: "You do your job &#8211; study hard, apply yourself, take the SAT and the courses you need to qualify &#8211; and we&#8217;ll do ours. We&#8217;ll make sure there&#8217;s a place for you at UC, and provide the financial assistance to help you get here."<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve visited high schools up and down the state, and it&#8217;s always exciting to see students learn about the financial support that exists and discover that a University of California education is attainable,&#8221; Yudof said. &#8220;If they push themselves, work hard and dream big, we&#8217;ll make sure the doors of opportunity are open to them. We want their talents, their passion and their perspectives.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Achieve UC builds on other programs the University of California has in high schools across the state to help put students on a path to college.<br/>
<br/>
Each year, thousands of students who apply to the University of California get in. This year, 40 percent of UC freshman are the first in their families to go to college. More than half come from homes where English is not the primary language. Four out of 10 come from low-income families.<br/>
<br/>
Achieve UC is the first coordinated effort to connect high school students with leaders across the UC system, and is expected to reach some 10,000 freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. Students will meet with UC advisors who can help them assess their preparation for college.<br/>
<br/>
They will learn about scholarships designed to make college affordable to all Californians &#8211; opportunities such as the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan, which covers the full cost of tuition for students whose families earn $80,000 a year or less. Additional scholarships and funds are available to help pay for books, for housing, and many other expenses.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4c5c7480807270460a26cd3b9e2377b8"><name>chancellor-video-2012</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Video message from Chancellor Blumenthal</title><summary>Fall Quarter video message from Chancellor Blumenthal.</summary><start-date>1349856000000</start-date><display-name>Video message from Chancellor Blumenthal</display-name><path>/2012/10/chancellor-video-2012</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/10/chancellor-video-2012</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1349900858441</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1349900945683</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div><span>In his Fall Quarter video message, Chancellor Blumenthal talks about UCSC's&#160;awesome students, accomplished faculty, the importance of the November 6&#160;election,&#160;and his new blog.</span></div>

<p>UCSC's government relations office has published <a href="http://vote.ucsc.edu">vote.ucsc.edu</a> and will continue to update it with the latest voter information.&#160;Vote.ucsc.edu has links to voter registration sites and information on several election forums and events scheduled on campus over the next three weeks.&#160; The page also has links to other related sites such as the county Elections Office and California Secretary of State's office.</p>
<p>Monday, October 22 is the last day to register and still be eligible to vote in the November 6 election.</p>
<p>October 22 is also the third and final presidential debate. A debate-watching event is set for 6 p.m. at the College Nine and Ten multipurpose room followed by an <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/10/election-forum.html">election forum</a> featuring John Laird (Stevenson, '72, politics), California's Secretary of Natural Resources. Laird and other panelists will that will look at the potential impacts to the state from the election.</p>
<p>One ballot initiative that will undoubtedly impact the state is Proposition 30, Gov. Jerry Brown's "Schools and Local Public Safety Protection Act."

<p>There are many ways to describe UC Santa Cruz, but those three words sum us up remarkably well&#8212;particularly in light of our recent ranking as one of the best universities under the age of 50. &#160;</p>
<p>We won&#8217;t celebrate our 50th anniversary until 2015&#8212;but we&#8217;ve already accomplished so much. This issue of Review is packed with stories of exploration and discovery, from astronomer Connie Rockosi mapping the outer range of our galaxy to historian Gail Hershatter capturing the experiences of women in rural China. &#160;</p>
<p>Two issues ago, our cover story focused on UCSC&#8217;s role in the emerging field of personalized medicine. That effort took a major stride forward this spring, when UCSC partnered with the National Cancer Institute to establish the Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub), a national repository that will help scientists around the globe make progress in their pursuit of genomics-based approaches to understanding cancer as a disease&#8212;and develop new options for treatment. &#160;</p>
<p>Our good news extends to graduate programs. I&#8217;m delighted to announce our new Ph.D. programs in feminist studies and Latin American and Latino studies, and a new master&#8217;s program in theater arts. &#160;</p>
<p>As we approach our 50th anniversary, UCSC has achieved a level of research excellence in fields as diverse as linguistics, engineering, economics, and marine science. We&#8217;ve outpaced peer institutions that have been around twice as long. &#160;</p>
<p>The backdrop to all this is, of course, our stunning location. Anyone who has ever set foot on campus will appreciate the story in this issue about the ways in which our setting inspires teachers and students, and even shapes the experience of learning itself.&#160;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to being young, smart, and beautiful!&#160;</p>
<p>Sincerely,&#160;</p>
<p>George Blumenthal&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4d4b05ac807270460a26cd3b6b2a7769"><name>pandey-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Triloki Pandey wins Gandhi medal for non-resident Indians</title><summary>Triloki N.

Pandey, a professor of anthropology at UC Santa Cruz, has been awarded the Mahatma Gandhi Pravasi Medal by the NRI Welfare Society of India.<br/>
<br/>
Pandey, who will receive the award Friday, October 12, 2012 at the House of Lords in London, is one of only 30 Indians worldwide to receive the honor. The Gandhi Pravasi medal is given to recognize outstanding services and achievements by Indians in the international arena.<br/>
<br/>
The NRI Welfare Society, based in New Dehli, was founded with the objective of strengthening the emotional bonds between non-resident Indians and India.<br/>
<br/>
In September, Pandey delivered the Justice S. Rangarajan Memorial Lecture at the Indian Institute of World Culture in Bangalore, India.<br/>
<br/>
Pandey joined the UCSC faculty in 1973. His research centers on tribal cultures in India, Nepal, and the American Southwest.

How time flies. We're starting the celebration by presenting stories in each issue of Review of what was happening on campus 50 years ago. First up: In 1962, the founding University Librarian arrives on campus and begins creating McHenry Library.&#160;&#160;</em></p>
<p>Fifty years ago, in the fall of 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis was escalating, and the United States and the Soviet Union came as close as they ever would to global nuclear war.&#160;</p>
<p>Against that backdrop of worldwide disaster, a University of California campus was being born in Santa Cruz, getting ready for its opening three years later.&#160;</p>
<p>Preparations for the new campus were beginning to roll. In September 1962, the campus's first librarian arrived, ready to start a university library from scratch.&#160;</p>
<p>His name was Donald Clark (1911&#8211;1993), and he was the first of Chancellor Dean E. McHenry's academic appointments at UCSC.&#160;</p>
<p>Before his appointment at Santa Cruz, Clark had been at Baker Library at the Harvard Graduate School of Business for more than 20 years.&#160;</p>
<p>Chancellor McHenry's invitation to participate in the Santa Cruz experiment in public higher education was a rare opportunity that Clark felt he couldn't pass up. He was also excited by the prospect of building a new library.&#160;</p>
<p>"Can you imagine the opportunity that would be given a librarian to start from zero?" Clark asked his interviewer in his oral history, Donald T. Clark: Early UCSC history and the founding of the University Library.&#160;</p>
<p>"Clark was a book man first and foremost, but he looked beyond the titles," said Hal Hyde, UCSC's first vice chancellor of business and finance. "He was broadly interested in the community and in geography."&#160;</p>
<p>In late October 1962, President John F. Kennedy negotiated with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to settle the Cuban Missile Crisis. The world breathed easier, and work on the UCSC campus could continue without the threat of nuclear disaster.&#160;</p>
<p>Clark proceeded with making plans for the building of McHenry Library. He became a pioneer in the area of library automation, working to create a computerized book catalog at UC Santa Cruz in the 1960s&#8212;the first such effort in the UC system.&#160;</p>
<p>Today's library&#8212;recently renovated&#8212;includes a caf&#233;, collaborative study areas, a large information commons containing more than 60 computer stations, a "laptop bar" with stools for optimum studying, and full wireless coverage.&#160;</p>
<p>Though McHenry Library has embraced the digital information age, it remains, as it began, a place for study, contemplation, and discovery&#8212; just as its founders envisioned it.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="50f9e94c8072704674be0a1eb97ebcf7"><name>philosophy-conference</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> UCSC to host free public conference exploring philosophy in multicultural context</title><summary>Is philosophical inquiry bound by history, geography or culture?

<br/>
On October 20, UCSC assistant professor of philosophy Rasmus Gr&#248;nfeldt Winther and UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Humanities Research will host a public conference examining the relationship between philosophy and its multicultural context.<br/>
<br/>
Participants will include researchers and thinkers from Google, San Francisco State University, San Jose State, Stanford, UC Santa Cruz, and the University of San Francisco.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Multiculturalism requires reflection,&#8221; noted Winther. &#8220;It is of increasing impact to us here in California and of course globally, particularly as the flow of people and information continues to accelerate.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Philosophy is often criticized for living in an Ivory Tower,&#8221; Winther added. &#8220;This is particularly true for the dominant Analytic tradition, which seems to forget that it is, after all, people who are philosophizing.</p>
<p>"What difference might distinct cultural contexts&#8212;such as Latin American, Indian, or Central African--have on framing supposedly &#8220;universal&#8221; philosophical questions about knowledge, values, and beauty?&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Winther noted that one of the main objectives of the conference is to discuss how to develop a philosophy that is both sensitive to cultural context, and what might be universal about the human condition.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Multiculturalism forces us to see that philosophy does not occur in a vacuum,&#8221; Winther observed.&#160; &#8220;If you change the power and context of the philosophical inquirer, the questions and answers may change.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Invited guests at the conference include Amir Najmi from Google, whose interests include a critical understanding of mathematical models and the role of human insight in machine learning. Or as Winthers puts it: &#8220;he is an engineer informed by the humanities.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
UCSC chemistry professor Scott Lokey will also discuss philosophy across the sciences, addressing a particular case of how philosophy can be part of a scientific dialogue.</p>
<p>The conference begins at 10 a.m. in UCSC&#8217;s Humanities 1 Building (Room 210) with opening remarks by dean of humanities William Ladusaw. It runs until 5:30 p.m., immediately followed by a reception. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>

<p>Our feature on the hands-on learning opportunities at KZSC in the spring '12 issue provoked an outpouring of warm memories from alums. We share a few of their letters here. Live long, Great 88! Share your story at <a href="http://facebook.com/kzscradio">facebook.com/kzscradio</a></p>
<p><strong>Radio radio</strong></p>
<p>I smiled and tapped some old memories spurred by your stories and history, having been one of the pioneering (and pretty bewildered) disc jockeys back in the late '60s. I had a show on KRUZ on Friday nights with another Stevenson student, Bob Sloan. We called the show "SOS" ("Schnaidt or Sloan"), and we really did need help. We played the music we liked, partied, and reached an audience in the dozens.</p>
<p>I know the station has gone on to better and more legitimate things, but its beginnings were part of our discovery processes and coming of age. We had a great time being on the radio. We did no harm, we think.</p>

<p>Your article brought back warm memories. I was one of the early crop of DJs at KRUZ. Little did I know that my days spinning vinyl would lead me to a journalism career that included covering rock music at the Minnesota Daily and stringing for Rolling Stone (one of the first women to do so); doing investigative reporting about United Way at a Sacramento rock-and-roll radio station (one of the first reporters to do so); getting fed up with lying weasels and going to law school to level the playing field when reporting&#8212; and then spending 27 years (and counting) as a legal journalist/ lawyer at New York&#8211; based media company ALM (I still love rock and roll).</p>

After working as a commercial radio jock, in TV news, and as a video editor following my tenure at KZSC, today I head a Los Angeles&#8211;based media production company that serves Fortune 500 companies. There is no doubt that my UCSC degrees in communications and music, anchored by my years at KZSC, were fundamental to my life and career path.</p>

<p>My <em>nombre</em> is "Dr. G." I was one of the many Latino or Spanish-language programmers of KZSC. I moved back into the area about five-and-a-half years ago and have since been dreaming of returning to KZSC. I had the most amazing adventure programming and airing what I called then "Alternative Music in Spanish." I was not aware at the time that an actual movement of what was referred to as Latin Alternative or Rock en Espa&#241;ol existed outside of the Santa Cruz County borders. Gracias, and que viva KZSC!</p>
<p><em>&#8212; Gerardo Sandoval</em></p>
<p>My main show was Mystic Maneuvers, playing progressive, indie, and trance-oriented rock &#224; la Dead Can Dance, Smiths, Peter Gabriel, etc. I was also a founder of Night of the Living Dead and the Jazztronauts, and I filled in on the Celtic music show on occasion. I was co-music director from 1987&#8211;89 and helped bring our album intake from 5 or 10 albums a month to more than 100.</p>

<p>I was station manager at KZSC from 2000&#8211;02. I was on the panel that hired [broadcast advisor] Michael Bryant, and I spearheaded the Measure 4 initiative to student parliament back in '02 [which provided KZSC with funding for renovations]. It serves me great bittersweet joy to see not only the article in the spring Review, but to see all the improvements! The mic for one! Anyway, I wanted to applaud KZSC 88.1. It was one of the best times of my life thus far. Keep it left of the dial!</p>

<p><strong>Being 100% Banana Slug Means &#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Being 100 percent Banana Slug means that I'm sufficiently sentimental and nerdy to have traveled to the campus in the fall of 2006, on the 30th anniversary of my first month as an undergraduate, and taken the above photograph. Of all the good fortune I've had in my life&#8212;at this point 34 years after graduating&#8212;nothing surpasses the transformative experiences I had at UCSC. I don't visit very often anymore, but it was like a dream, in all its messiness, fondly remembered.</p>

<h2>Milky Way destined for head-on collision with Andromeda galaxy</h2>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="Galactic collision" src="images/galactic-collision.jpg" width="360"/> 
<p>The night sky 4 billion years from now would look something like this as the Andromeda galaxy begins to collide and merge with the Milky Way. The image is based on dynamical computer modeling of the future collision between the two galaxies. (llustration: NASA, ESA, Z. Levay [STSCI], and O. Mellinger)</p>
</div>
<p>Our galactic neighbor the Andromeda galaxy is on a collision course with our own Milky Way galaxy, according to new observations by a team of astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p>Also called M31, the Andromeda galaxy is the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way. Painstaking measurements of its motion show that it will collide with the Milky Way about 4 billion years from now. M31 is now 2.5 million light-years away, but inexorably drifting ever nearer to us under the mutual pull of gravity between the two galaxies.</p>
<p>Puragra Guhathakurta, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, said astronomers have long speculated that the two galaxies would eventually collide. "Now we've shown that a collision is inevitable," he said.</p>

<h2>UCSC nabs 'young' award</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is ranked seventh in the world among the 100 best universities less than 50 years old, according to an analysis by <em>Times Higher Education.</em></p>
<p>UCSC ranked first in the world in the key citation index (30 percent of the final score) that measures the influence of an institution's research.</p>
<p>UCSC and UC Irvine, both founded in 1965, were the only American universities to rank in the top 10. Irvine was fourth. Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea was ranked first.</p>

<h2>'Personalized' medicine gets closer</h2>
<p>The emerging field of "personalized" or "precision" medicine holds great promise in the fight against cancer. If scientists can identify the genetic changes that drive each patient's cancer cells, they can use that information to develop targeted treatments. But achieving this goal will require massive amounts of genomic and clinical data and a sophisticated infrastructure to manage and analyze the data.</p>
<p>UCSC has completed a first step in building this infrastructure, according to UC Santa Cruz bioinformatics expert David Haussler.</p>
<p>Haussler's team has established the Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub), a large-scale data repository and user portal for the National Cancer Institute's cancer genome research programs. CGHub is providing cancer researchers with efficient access to a large and rapidly growing store of valuable biomedical data.</p>
<p>The project is funded by the National Cancer Institute through a $10.3 million subcontract with SAIC-Frederick Inc., the prime contractor for the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research.</p>

<p>"I plan to continue Gabe Zimmerman's legacy by pursuing issues I'm passionate about," said Yethz&#233;ll D&#237;az, a senior with a double major in Latin American and Latino studies and sociology, as she was awarded the first Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship.</p>
<p>Zimmerman (Stevenson '02, sociology), who was an aide to U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., was killed in the January 2011 shooting in Tucson that wounded Giffords.</p>
<p>D&#237;az received the $2,500 scholarship in an April ceremony at Stevenson that brought together her family and Zimmerman's parents.</p>

<h2>Arts Division gets creative</h2>
<p>Arts Dean David Yager recently partnered with Bonny Doon Vineyard winemaker and alumnus Randall Grahm (Porter preferred year '74, philosophy, literature, pre-med) to develop specially bottled wines with custom- designed labels by UCSC art students.</p>
<p>Part of the proceeds from these wines will go to supporting UCSC arts scholarships.</p>
<p>Art major Louise Leong created the winning image for the 2010 Banana Slug Roussanne white wine. She is also a staff illustrator for the campus's student newspaper, <em>City on a Hill Press.</em></p>
<p>Leong's brightly colored label includes images of honey bees, plus the winemaker's signature red Citroen automobile.</p>
<p>The partnership is part of renewed efforts by Yager to reconnect with alumni and communities near and far.</p>

<h2>History prof pens cover story for <em>The Nation</em></h2>
<p>The June 11 issue of <em>The Nation</em> magazine featured a cover story by UC Santa Cruz history professor Dana Frank.</p>
<p>Titled <em>Honduras: Which Side is the U.S. On?</em>, the article examines the impact of the 2009 military coup in Honduras and U.S. policy supporting the new regime, describing a corrupt drug war that Frank says has been used as the pretext for increased U.S. militarization of the area.</p>
<p>One of the top academic experts on Honduras in the United States, Frank has been commenting on the volatile situation in the region for media including National Public Radio, the <em>Chicago Tribune,</em> and the Associated Press.</p>

</div>
<h2>Drug-resistant bacteria tackled with new method</h2>
<p>Researchers at UC Santa Cruz have developed a novel approach for eradicating drug-resistant bacteria from wounds and skin infections, using light to trigger the controlled release of nitric oxide. The UCSC team developed a photoactive compound that releases nitric oxide when exposed to light, and loaded it into a porous, biocompatible material that could be applied as a sprayable powder.</p>
<p>In laboratory tests, the light-triggered nitric oxide treatment eradicated a highly drug-resistant strain of <em>Acinetobacter baumannii,</em> a type of gram-negative bacteria that causes hard-to-treat and potentially lethal infections throughout the world, including serious infections in soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The team led by Pradip Mascharak, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and graduate student Brandon Heilman published their results in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society.</em></p>

<h2>Turning trash to slash</h2>
<p>In February, UCSC Environmental Health &amp; Safety put on polystyrene foam recycling collection day for the laboratories on Science Hill.</p>
<p>Physical Plant teamed up with a program called Waste to Waves (<a href="http://wastetowaves.org" title="Waste To Waves">wastetowaves.org</a>) based out of southern California, which collected all the polystyrene foam products and will use them to make surfboard blanks.</p>
<p>The event was hailed as a major success, with nearly 150 pounds of Styrofoam and other polystyrene products winding up in the recycling containers instead of going to a landfill.</p>
<p>Organizers say the event went so well, they will host follow-ups on a regular basis.</p>
<p>"Campus laboratories have been saving their (foam products), waiting for an opportunity to sustainably recycle the problematic waste," said April Anstey, Hazardous Waste Manager for UCSC Environmental Health &amp; Safety.</p>

<h2>Book details efforts to save seals</h2>
<p>In 2009, federal officials monitoring the endangered Hawaiian monk seal population asked marine biologist Terrie Williams if she could care for an orphaned pup at her lab at UCSC. Williams, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, jumped at the opportunity to study one of these rare tropical seals in her marine mammal physiology program.</p>
<p>She had little idea at the time just what it would mean to get involved in the life of Kauai Pup 2, or KP2.</p>
<p>Her new book, <em>The Odyssey of KP2: An Orphan Seal, a Marine Biologist, and the Fight to Save a Species,</em> is the story of this boisterous seal pup, the special bond Williams formed with him, and the scientific insights that could help to save an endangered species.</p>

<h2>Prison expert testifies on solitary confinement</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz psychology professor Craig Haney, the nation's leading expert on inmate mental health, was called to testify before a U.S. Senate subcommittee investigating solitary confinement.</p>
<p>For many inmates, Haney told senators, "solitary confinement precipitates a descent into madness." Prisoners in long-term solitary confinement suffer psychological breakdowns from the lack of human contact that can lead to psychosis, mutilations, and suicide, Haney said.</p>
<p>Haney has been named to a National Academy of Science panel of leading scholars and experts on corrections to study the causes and consequences of high rates of incarceration in the United States.</p>

<h2>In memoriam: M. Brewster Smith</h2>
<p>M. Brewster Smith, professor emeritus of psychology at UC Santa Cruz, whose research and testimony contributed to the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision that banned school segregation, died in August in Santa Cruz. He was 93.</p>
<p>Smith joined UC Santa Cruz as vice chancellor for social sciences in 1970, five years after the campus opened. He served in that capacity until 1975, then continued as a professor of psychology until he retired in 1988. Even after retirement, Smith was an active teacher and researcher.</p>
<p>"Psychology has lost a major contributor and statesman," said longtime UCSC colleague psychology professor Thomas Pettigrew.</p>

<br/>
The annual student-organized conference features workshops on organizing and social issues and will take place from 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the College Nine/Ten multipurpose room.<br/>
<br/>
The conference's anniversary coincides with College Ten's 10th anniversary and its theme of social justice and community. A reception is scheduled after the conference's conclusion to celebrate the anniversary. College Ten alumni and students are invited.<br/>
<br/>
Practical Activism "is very much a student organized conference," said provost Helen Shapiro. "It is a major, significant event for College Ten," she said, and students began planning the event in the spring.<br/>
<br/>
College Ten is UCSC's newest college. Many of its most active alums are expected to return to celebrate the anniversary, Shapiro said.<br/>
<br/>
Two sessions of workshops are scheduled with a variety of topics including UCSC budget cuts and retention, education and incarceration, sustainable agriculture, resource extraction, transgender healthcare, LGBT legislation, anti-immigrant legislation, social media for social justice, reproductive rights, and mental and psychological disabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Also speaking are several UCSC professors and community members; also, Terisa Tinei Siagatonu, a College Ten alumna who is a spoken word artist, arts educator, and community organizer from the Bay Area. A complete list of workshop times and participants can be found at <a href="http://activism.ucsc.edu">http://activism.ucsc.edu</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Davis's address is scheduled for the opening session between 11:45 a.m. and 12:50 p.m. Davis joined UCSC in 1984 as a lecturer in the history of consciousness. She was appointed professor in 1991 and served as chair of the Feminist Studies Department from 2003-2006. She retired four years ago but continues to speak and teach.<br/>
<br/>
Davis is known internationally for her work to combat oppression in the United States and abroad. She has been active as a student, teacher, writer, scholar, and activist/organizer.<br/>

<p>One night, she saw a star disappear as it passed behind the rings of Saturn and then wink at her through a gap in the rings. Even if she couldn't see the gap directly, the reappearance of the star proved that it was there.</p>
<p>"It was a neat experience," she says. "It's the kind of detective work that we have to do as astronomers, because we can't go out and poke at the things we observe. We have to tell a story based on very limited and indirect observations. This was my first taste of what it's like to do science."</p>
<p>Now, as an astronomy professor at UC Santa Cruz, Rockosi, 40, has the opportunity to practice this kind of deduction on a regular basis. She studies the history and structure of our Milky Way galaxy. But you can't see what the Milky Way looked like 5 or 10 billion years ago through any telescope. You have to piece together the clues and tell a story.</p>
<p>Rockosi has already found enough clues to completely change astronomers' view of the Milky Way. Instead of a relatively placid whirlpool of gas that condensed and formed a spiral of stars, we now know that the Milky Way has been a voracious feeder on smaller, nearby galaxies. Rockosi and her colleagues have identified several streams of stars that are moving at a different velocity from the surrounding stars. These streams are the torn-apart shreds of a devoured galaxy. Though the stars have been assimilated by the Milky Way, their anomalous motion is a relic of the galaxy that they grew up in.</p>
<p>The discovery would not have been possible without the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), a huge collaborative project funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation that has assembled a virtual encyclopedia of stars and galaxies.</p>
<p>To find a stream of stars moving at the "wrong" velocity, as Rockosi did, you have to look at lots of stars, and you have to survey a vast area, because the Milky Way is all around us. In other words, you need an archive just like the one that SDSS has compiled.</p>
<h2>Birth of a survey</h2>
<p>It's no accident that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey came along just in time for Rockosi's research, because she helped build the equipment in the first place. She began working on the project in 1992, when she was still an undergraduate at Princeton University and the telescope existed only on the drawing board of her professor, James Gunn. She has continued to work for the Sloan survey ever since.</p>
<p>Gunn, the project's chief scientist, envisioned a new kind of telescope with a huge field of view, which could simultaneously measure the spectra of 640 different stars or galaxies, like a fly with 640 eyes.</p>
<p>The "eyes"&#8212;or detectors&#8212;that would make or break the project, a new generation of devices, weren't even available yet. When they finally did arrive, they were beyond finicky. Each one was a precision instrument that differed from all the others, and needed an engineer who knew exactly how that particular detector behaved. That engineer turned out to be Connie Rockosi.</p>
<p>"She started in the spring of her junior year," Gunn says. "I knew that she was considered the star student of the electrical engineering department. She turned out to be every bit as good, if not better, than everyone said."</p>
<p>Her first project was building circuit boards for the detectors, which she did so well that Gunn asked her to keep working on the Sloan camera while she was in graduate school at the University of Chicago. Although it meant putting her dissertation on hold, she shepherded the camera from the drawing board to its installation at Apache Point, New Mexico, in 1998.</p>
<p>As the rest of the telescope came on line, she took on more and more responsibility for running it. By the time Rockosi joined the UC Santa Cruz Astronomy Department in 2004, "she knew more about the nitty-gritty of that telescope than I did," says Gunn.</p>
<p>Rockosi received a 2006 Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering&#8212;one of the nation's most prestigious honors for young faculty members.</p>
<h2>Technical talent</h2>
<p>To her colleagues on the Sloan project, Rockosi's technical skills became legendary.</p>
<p>"My first time at Apache Point Observatory was in August 1999, just when they were bringing the spectrographs out," says David Schlegel of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. "Everything was already broken. I kept hearing people say, 'Connie will be out here soon, she'll fix it.' So one day I'm chitchatting at a meal with a person named Connie, who looked about 16 years old. About halfway into the conversation I had this epiphany: Connie! You must be the person everyone is talking about! In my mind she was such a towering figure, I had thought she must be much older."</p>
<p>It isn't just machines that Rockosi has learned to handle. In the current funding cycle, called Sloan-III, she coordinated the Milky Way part of the survey, which meant managing people.</p>
<div class="contentBox callout-right wide">
<h2>Private funding changes paradigms</h2>
<p>Thanks to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, astronomers now have a catalogue of images and spectra for hundreds of thousands of stars in the Milky Way, as well as hundreds of thousands of galaxies beyond the Milky Way. It is one of the greatest success stories ever for privately funded science.</p>
<p>About a third of the original $75 million to get the telescope built, and to organize a team of several hundred people, came from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, based in New York City. The rest came from government sources and individual universities. The foundation has continued to support the operation of the telescope through two more cycles, called Sloan-II and Sloan-III.</p>
<p>The value of the Sloan survey, Gunn says, resides not so much in any great discoveries as in the vast amount of information that it places at every astronomer's fingertips.</p>
<p>"It's like building a pyramid," Gunn says. "Rather than one huge brick, you need thousands of small ones."</p>
<p>The Sloan Survey has changed the way that astronomy is done, Gunn adds. Astronomers used to spend two nights on the telescope to observe something, he said. (Or not&#8212;astronomers would often wait months to get two nights on a telescope, only to have their plans ruined by cloudy weather.)</p>
<p>"Now you learn to do database queries," Gunn says. "The whole paradigm has changed because of the Sloan Survey."</p>
</div>
<p>"She understands politics like no one her age I've ever met," says Heather Morrison of Case Western Reserve University. "She doesn't have an ego that needs to be stroked or coddled. She understands when people might be getting peeved about something, and she is ahead of you in worrying about that. And she is very protective of the needs of graduate students."</p>
<p>The increased focus on the Milky Way is itself a major evolution of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which was originally intended to answer large-scale cosmological questions about the structure of the universe. Sloan-I was essentially a survey of galaxies and quasars, which collected data on the stars in our own galaxy only as a byproduct. They were like bugs on the windshield that the telescope had to look through.</p>
<p>But a funny thing happened: the bugs on the windshield turned out to form interesting patterns. The telescope was seeing mostly stars that are in the Milky Way but lie outside the main disk, in the so-called halo.</p>
<p>"The cartoon picture we all learned in graduate school was that the halo was pretty uniform," Rockosi said.</p>
<p>However, Brian Yanny of Fermilab and Heidi Newberg of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute found clumps and streams of stars in the halo.</p>
<p>"That fits well with the theory that galaxies form from smaller dwarf galaxies that merge together to form a larger one," Rockosi says. She is now continuing their work with her own students, trying to determine how common these mergers have been, and how many mergers it takes to form a Milky Way.</p>
<p>"Although we're looking at our own galaxy, we're doing cosmology too," Rockosi says. "We're trying to understand whether our galaxy fits the picture of how we think galaxies form. We just get to do it up close and personal, on smaller scales."</p>
<h2>Weighing the galaxy</h2>
<p>One of the projects Rockosi has in mind for the future sounds deceptively easy: to weigh the galaxy. In fact, nobody quite knows how much mass there is in the Milky Way. To figure that out, you need to study the orbits of stars that are as far away as possible from the center.</p>
<p>"The problem is that the galaxy is not made up just of stars, but mostly out of dark matter," Rockosi says. "The stars are all concentrated at the center. The most interesting places to look at are far out, and that's where the fewest stars are. That's why you need a big survey and a big view of the sky, to pick out these very rare objects."</p>
<p>At present, Sloan-III is funded through the summer of 2014. Beyond that, everybody on the team hopes for continued support from the Sloan Foundation, and the science projects for a prospective fourth round have already been selected.</p>
<p>One other change will also take effect. Gunn, Rockosi's mentor, is planning to retire from his position as operations coordinator for the survey. Beginning in 2014, Rockosi will take over his duties.</p>
<p>"I can't imagine Sloan-IV happening without her," Gunn says.</p>

Martha Mendoza asked as she made her way through the forest, eucalyptus leaves crackling beneath her shoes. Her destination, a damp cave, was not far from the road.</p>
<p>Mendoza (Kresge '89, journalism/education), a Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning reporter for the Associated Press, teaches an investigative reporting class at UC Santa Cruz for graduate students in the Science Communication Program.</p>
<p>Most lessons take place in a classroom.</p>
<p>"But there comes a day in our semester when I tell them, 'Tomorrow, wear sturdy boots and be prepared to get muddy.' Usually they are mystified and excited," Mendoza said.</p>
<p>For professors across the disciplines, the redwood-lined, rugged, and occasionally spooky campus is a vast resource.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the university's extremely unusual location, teachers are not afraid to have students cross creeks, dig through sticky mud, and get their hands&#8212;not to mention their pant legs&#8212;dirty.</p>
<p>The setting and learning are inextricably linked. At the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, apprentices learn organic gardening and farming. At the UCSC Arboretum, which houses the largest collection of Australian and South African plants outside their native countries, students volunteer and pursue internships. Over the years, student interns have conducted archaeological excavations within the Cowell Limeworks Historic District.</p>
<p>The land also inspires reflection and creativity; when College Eight lecturer Candace Calsoyas teaches freshman seminars on "Environment and Society," she leads students across the wooded campus while they walk, talk, and learn&#8212;a model that dates back to Aristotle, who founded the peripatetic school.</p>
<p>"Though UCSC is exceptionally beautiful with its mountain perch, majestic redwoods, and textured seascape below, still every landscape and cityscape suits the 'walk and talk,'" Calsoyas said. "Unlike being in the classroom, students don't feel put on the spot and are more liberated by being outside."</p>
<p>Over the years, UCSC's unique location has informed, enriched, and expanded the curriculum while allowing students to test their hunches and perfect their skills outdoors.</p>
<h2>Spelunking witha skilled reporter</h2>
<p>"Oh, look," Martha Mendoza said as she paused in a clearing. "It's a deer. And oh, there's a fawn. And another! Last time we were out here, a lizard ran right over a student's foot. It scared her."</p>
<p>Mendoza's experiential slogs are meant to help students learn to capture telling details on paper, even when they find themselves in unnerving places.</p>
<p>"Part of the lesson is being in an uncomfortable situation and still being observant," she said.</p>
<p>Gingerly, Mendoza lowered herself into the throat of the limestone cave, using a sturdy ladder. There were no sounds but Mendoza's breathing, the "droop-droop-droop" of an unseen water source, and the "smack" of her sunglasses, which fell off her face and landed in some dark corner of the cave.</p>
<p>Several of the campus caves provide habitat for rare cave invertebrates, some of which are believed to occur only on campus. These species are likely sensitive to disturbance, and educational users are informed about ways to minimize impacts while taking advantage of the opportunity to teach amidst and about these unique and rare organisms.</p>
<p>"A reporter has to be out of the comfort zone," Mendoza said as she turned on her flashlight, which only poked a hole in the dark. "If I'm in Haiti, reporting on exploratory drilling at a gold mine, and there's all this noise and people walking by with weapons, I have to really settle myself and say, 'What are these people wearing, and is it hot or cold out? What's going on?' Even if I had beautiful photos and video, it's just not the same as getting it down on paper in the moment."</p>
<h2>Insects, chaparral, and scientific processes</h2>
<p>Erika Zavaleta, associate professor of environmental studies, uses outdoor opportunities in every course she teaches&#8212;even 350-person lecture classes.</p>
<p>"UCSC has a huge diversity of ecosystems right on campus: mixed conifer forest, chaparral, grassland, redwood forest, riparian forest, streams, and of course agricultural lands," she said. "Where I grew up in the Northeast you would need to drive for hours to cross through this many kinds of ecosystems."</p>
<p>Zavaleta takes an inquiry-based approach, giving students the chance to explore an area and wrestle with such questions as, "Are there more kinds of insects in the forest or the chaparral?"</p>
<p>Students haul field guides, compasses, transect tapes, and nets into the field. Soon they've made graphs and drawn up posters to present to the class.</p>
<p>"I hear them talk about what an exciting thing it is to think and problem-solve for themselves, and get out and actually do science rather than just hearing about it," Zavaleta said.</p>
<p>"Just the simple experience of looking in the right places for salamanders and finding them, or of trying to figure out why the forest ends and the grassland starts right at a particular place, lights up so many students," Zavaleta continued. "They connect places with intellectual ideas and practical skills."</p>
<h2>Stalking the elusive microphage</h2>
<p>The students of Grant Hartzog, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology, take to the forest in search of bacteriophages, viruses that attack bacteria.</p>
<p>So many exist in nature that they are thought to kill off a large proportion of bacteria on planet Earth every day. Still, students must prowl around in search of them.</p>
<p>First they isolate the virus from the soil, photograph it with help from an electron microscope, and extract its DNA. Then a laboratory takes a close look at the DNA sequence.</p>
<p>When it comes to phage hunting and genetic documentation, "you don't need an abundance of technical skills to be successful right away," Hartzog said. "You need to be enthusiastic, curious, and willing to learn."</p>
<p>The result is original findings.</p>
<p>"Every student is doing the same kind of technical manipulations, but each is collecting a unique virus," Hartzog said. "This means that although these beginning students are working together on similar projects, they are doing authentic research and making a real contribution. They take a project and have total ownership of it."</p>
<p>They even get to name the newly discovered phages. So far, undergraduates have dubbed them Darth, FlowerChild, Haze, Jeffabunny, TreeBaby, Zigzag, Rage, Lugosi, DomoArigato, and Firecracker, among other names.</p>
<p>One of Hartzog's students, Daniel McKernan (Oakes '14, human biology), quickly learned that some areas on campus are better than others for finding phages.</p>
<p>"It is best to collect soil samples in damper shaded areas," he said. "I collected about 15 soil samples here on campus at UCSC in the dirtiest, muddiest, smelliest areas I could find.</p>
<p>"The search was fun," McKernan said. "It took hiking in creek beds and digging through mud. It was interesting to go out in search of stagnant, wet soil."</p>
<p>The next step was examining the phage using an electron microscope.</p>
<p>"If the phage that I have isolated is novel, meaning that it has never before been discovered, I think I will name it after my dog, Broseph," McKernan said.</p>
<h2>Reading a forest, leaf by leaf</h2>
<p>In late summer, five student interns ventured out into the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve, 400 acres of protected natural lands on the 2,000-acre campus.</p>
<p>They were heading out toward the 15-acre Forest Ecology Reseach Plot (FERP), a research and teaching site established by environmental studies professor Greg Gilbert five years ago. There, students and scientists have catalogued and tagged more than 10,000 individual plants, including Douglas-fir, coast live oak, Shreve oak, and tanoak.</p>
<p>These students&#8212;mostly undergrads, but also a couple of newly minted UCSC graduates&#8212;are all paid interns, advancing science by helping with the FERP research project, spending eight hours a day, five days a week, in the forest.</p>
<div class="contentBox callout-right wide">
<h2>Cave care</h2>
<p>UCSC's caves are sensitive habitats that require careful stewardship by all.</p>
<p>Appropriate use of the campus caves is limited to research and occasional guided visits for university classes, during which students are informed about ways to minimize impacts while taking advantage of the opportunity to learn about the area's unique geology and its rare subterranean organisms, according to Alex Jones, Campus Natural Reserve steward.</p>
<p>Jones urges visitors to be sensitive to flora and fauna throughout the campus's natural areas, including its caves.</p>
<p>"Caves on and around the UCSC campus provide habitat for rare cave invertebrates, including the Dollof cave spider and the Empire Cave pseudoscorpion, which are believed to occur only within these caves," Jones said. "These species and the caves' geologic features are vulnerable to disturbances caused by recreational use. Substantial degradation of cave features has been documented within the past few decades since their discovery."</p>
</div>
<p>"There's nothing else like this in the UC system," said Gage Dayton, director of UCSC Natural Reserves. "You can learn a lot in the lecture hall or lab. But if you want to get a feel for what poison oak looks like, bang a hammer on a rock, dig a pitfall to trap and catch an animal, measure light penetration in a real forest, and capture and analyze water from a creek, you just can't get that in the classroom or a laboratory. And this is right outside our door."</p>
<p>Getting students out to natural areas would have been logistically difficult and expensive "if you had to find buses for all of them," Dayton said. "But this is five minutes from the door of traditional classrooms. All students should be getting out here and using it."</p>
<p>Along the way, the students get an intimate knowledge of how science works and best practices in research. They also have fun, making deliberately geeky jokes about "liking lichens" and sampling huckleberries straight off the vine.</p>
<p>The huckleberries are of the same genus as blueberries, explained Alex Chacon, 19 (College Nine '15, plant science). "They're the worst plants to measure because of how bushy they are and how many stems they have."</p>
<p>They insist that a visitor sniff a sprig of spicy wild mint and feel the contours of asmooth hazelnut leaf. They express sympathy for a western fence lizard that someone, perhaps a speeding bicyclist, has squished on the trail, and marvel at a strewn-about deer carcass.</p>
<p>In the process, they grow their scientific skills hour by hour, day by day.</p>
<p>"When you work on someone else's project you start seeing how scientists think," said Kathlyn Franco, 22 (Cowell '12, environmental studies), who wants to be a mammalogist.</p>
<p>"You start seeing how they find and fix mistakes and how to find a better way," Franco continued. "You start building all these ways of seeing and doing. Gage [Dayton] will often answer my questions with questions: 'What are the drawbacks and benefits of doing this?'"</p>
<p>To trek with these bright students through the reserves, past thick stands of chaparral, Douglas-fir, and madrones with peeling bark, is to see the campus landscape in a completely different light. At last they arrived at the FERP, where every single shrub and tree of a certain height and diameter is being studied.</p>
<p>Considering this whole place is a living laboratory, it makes sense that the students suddenly stopped and put on what appeared to be lab coats. Actually, they were lightweight all-white Tyvek suits, designed to protect them from one of the plants they're studying&#8212; native poison oak.</p>
<p>"Poison oak is very interesting," observed Catherine Scheid, 20 (Cowell '14, environmental studies), who has no fear of the nasty stuff. She may be immune. "It takes different forms. It can grow like a shrub. Sometimes it looks like a little tree."</p>
<p>The students were accompanied by Alex Jones, UCSC Campus Natural Reserve steward. Student interns spend so much time out here with him that they've started to know the forest intimately.</p>
<p>"A Cooper's Hawk nested here in the spring," Jones observed. "The female used to dive-bomb the interns. Now they're at the stage when we can hear three chicks begging for food."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

in information technology with student-driven social justice ventures</article-subhead><article-text><p>Guadalupe Guerrero picks raspberries for a living in the fields of Watsonville. Until recently, she could not use a computer.</p>
<p>For many of us who do use computers, our digital lives have become almost as vivid and important as our real-world ones. In our intricately connected society, being shut out from the online world is greatly limiting, and the space between those with access and without is a growing divide.</p>
<p>"Technology has been revolutionary in every aspect of our lives," UCSC sociology professor Paul Lubeck says. "Economic opportunity is increasingly dependent on using these technologies."</p>
<p>Guerrero has now leaped the divide. Today she has a website for her burgeoning bakery side business. She uses YouTube to learn new baking techniques and Facebook to post photos of her cakes and communicate with family in Mexico. She checks her daughter's grades online.</p>
<p>"She's comfortable with the computer now," says daughter Ebelin Mata, 14, a Watsonville High School sophomore.</p>
<p>Ebelin and Guerrero are both clients of the UCSC Global Information Internship Program (GIIP), a unique undergraduate social justice venture: GIIP guided Guerrero into the digital world, and they recently organized a technology camp on the UCSC campus, where Ebelin and other Watsonville-area Latino high school students learned to develop mobile apps and navigate the ins and outs of college applications.</p>
<h2>Tech consultants to nonprofits</h2>
<p>GIIP's project in Watsonville is just one of many the program has developed around the world. Nonprofit organizations have limited resources and often can't take advantage of existing technology that could greatly improve their efficiency. GIIP interns identify causes close to their hearts&#8212;environmental, educational, or otherwise&#8212;and seek out nonprofit partners in those areas that need their information and communications technology services. The interns essentially act as tech consultants to their nonprofit partners, be they in Watsonville or Nigeria.</p>
<p>"It's an amazing thing to take someone in Africa where books are unknown, and put them on the Internet where they can see all the libraries available to them," says Lubeck, GIIP founder and director.</p>
<p>GIIP interns help partner nonprofits wherever technology would improve operations: interns might teach courses on basic computer programming, set up databases and websites for small organizations, or create digital videos.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, UCSC undergraduates who join GIIP gain skills they cannot attain in a lecture hall, such as "the ability to analyze problems facing a community and address them," says GIIP Fellow Yethz&#233;ll D&#237;az (College Nine '12, Latin American and Latino studies/sociology).</p>
<p>"People come out of GIIP knowing how to run a nonprofit&#8212;it's the equivalent of two to three years' experience of highlevel nonprofit work," says GIIP Global Advisory Board member Mark Headley (Stevenson '83, politics and economics). "It's very much in the founding spirit of UCSC: students are given a certain amount of freedom to explore."</p>
<p>Headley has been a long-time supporter of what he calls the "unique and inspiring GIIP experience"; he recently made a gift to the program that will establish the Dorothy E. Everett Endowed Chair and fulfill other program needs.</p>
<h2>Field experiences in Ethiopia</h2>
<p>When then-GIIP intern Jyesha Wren (College Ten '11, intensive sociology) arrived in Ethiopia to work with grassroots reproductive health organizations, her partners on the ground were surprised to see a young woman traveling across the world alone. They wondered how her husband (for surely a woman at the ripe old age of 25 would be married) could possibly allow this.</p>
<p>Wren went with a keen interest in learning about gender-based violence. The girls in one community she assisted had called for an office of women's affairs to be added to their local police station, where records of violations against women could be kept. With the handwritten forms the station was using, it was impossible to create a database; Wren developed a Microsoft Access electronic form for reporting violations and trained staff to use the program.</p>
<p>Wren saw firsthand the ingenuity required to go against practices ingrained in culture. The director of one organization working to eradicate female genital mutilation deployed many strategies simultaneously, recognizing that change would only come when the tides of public opinion shifted. He pushed for schools to open in places where there were none, since schools could teach reproductive health and messages of nonviolence. He promoted public weddings of brides who were "uncut," showing that brides who hadn't been mutilated were still marriageable.</p>
<p>Wren's field experience led to her decision to go beyond research and policy work and become a midwife. Now a UC San Francisco Masters Entry Program in Nursing student, Wren plans to create a birth and wellness center incorporating a pharmacy and shop that will make it self-sustaining, not dependent on grants for funding. It is, she concedes, a "huge vision," but GIIP has given her the confidence&#8212;and entrepreneurial acumen&#8212;to aim high.</p>
<h2>The basics of GIIP</h2>
<p>In 1998, when Professor Lubeck launched GIIP as an informal working group to explore how technology could be used for public good, he had no inkling how that small group would grow.</p>
<p>Now GIIP is an established curriculum anchored by a three-course series, during which interns come up with an idea, write a business plan, learn to design and implement a project, and apply for grant funding. They take technological workshops tailored to their project needs and skill levels. Interns who do well during their first year are invited to become Fellows, tasked with managing GIIP, teaching technology workshops, handling program publicity, and doing anything else needed. "What makes GIIP work is Fellows have power," Lubeck says.</p>
<p>Even after launching into the world, some alumni are later compelled to return as Executive Fellows, overseeing operations. Katie Roper (Stevenson '07, environmental studies and economics), credits GIIP as her "first taste of having total responsibility for a project that was ambitious and meaningful." She is now an Executive Fellow and GIIP's managing director.</p>
<p>With so much demanded of interns, Lubeck realized formal recognition was necessary to credit those who had taken on especially time-consuming enterprises; thus was the "intensive sociology" (a.k.a. Global Information and Social Enterprise Studies [GISES]) major/minor born, with support from the sociology department. GISES majors complete an honors-quality information technology project and document in detail their experiences. Fifteen GISES majors and minors graduated last year.</p>
<h2>Flexibility in the real world</h2>
<p>The city of Cairo, Egypt, has no formal recycling program. Instead, there are "garbage villages," whole communities that make their living from selling the recyclables they find among the garbage of Cairo residents. Men from the garbage villages roam around the city collecting trash and bring it back to the village, where women and children sort through the piles, picking valuables from rotting organic waste.</p>
<p>One woman, Lydia Marcos, started an NGO to help a small garbage village bring in infrastructure like water pipes. Marcos got to chatting with her friend, GIIP Fellow Sarah Shokair (College Nine '13, environmental studies/Earth sciences), one day. Shokair had just learned to create donor databases using Excel, exactly what Marcos needed. They decided Shokair would set up databases, donor newsletters, and a web presence for Marcos's organization, and put together a training packet so interns could take over later.</p>
<p>Shokair researched intensively for several months; meanwhile, things were suddenly moving for the garbage village: the government finally approved a water pipe into the village. Residents were too busy to provide updates for the newsletter and website. Shokair suggested she obtain a computer for the village so they could upload updates themselves. There again she was stymied, as there were no public facilities in which to place a computer.</p>
<p>The ability to roll with punches is impossible to learn in class. After investing much energy into her project, Shokair recognized perhaps this was not the ideal moment to pursue it. She moved on to other work, but wants to resume her venture on a smaller scale when things settle. When she told Roper about the experience, Roper assured her it was OK: things change all the time when you go into the field, and you have to be flexible.</p>
<h2>Tech camp</h2>
<p>At the recent technology camp on campus, Ebelin and the other high school students toured UCSC on a sunny August afternoon. GIIP Fellows coordinator Thomas Gelder, a senior GISES major (College Ten), brings them to a high point overlooking athletic facilities, a soccer field and, further in the distance, the Pacific Ocean. The students stop for a minute and quietly gaze at the water. Today they will walk through forested paths, the main library, and other UCSC landmarks while D&#237;az and Gelder cheerfully lay out the world available to them if they become UCSC undergraduates themselves.</p>
<p>Later that day, the students will start a week's course on mobile app development. They'll also learn how to apply and pay for college, and the benefits of federal student aid, something Gelder says he didn't discover until well into his college career. He doesn't want them to make the same mistake.</p>
<p>Gelder is tying the two camp themes together by teaching the students to build a "personalized college mentor" app that will keep track of their college application process, reminding them of important details such as deadlines and the extra-curricular activities they should list in their applications. Many of these students will be the first in their family to attend college; perhaps some will go into technology fields, where Latinos are underrepresented. Gelder wants to give them whatever advantages he can.</p>
<p>"GIIP is a lot of work, but as with all the best things in life, you get out of it what you put into it," Gelder says.</p>
<p>Young people at university are exposed to giant, insurmountable problems, Gelder says, and they can feel helpless to make a difference beyond "'liking' something on Facebook."</p>
<p>GIIP puts many more powerful tools than Facebook into the hands of those who truly yearn to better the world.</p>

I've been so impressed by the energy and enthusiasm of our campus community at every event I've attended, from move-in to the Boardwalk Frolic, the OPERS Fall Festival, and the Graduate Student Barbeque. For new students, faculty, and staff: Welcome to UC Santa Cruz--this is how we do it here!<br/>
<br/>
There are several important matters I want to make sure are on your radar screen. First, the deadline to <a href="http://www.californiastudentvote.org/register-to-vote-ca">register to vote</a> is October 22. The presidential race has significant and long-term implications for higher education, as do the critical ballot initiatives facing California voters.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/09/about-prop-30.html">Proposition 30</a> has funding implications for all levels of public education in the state, from kindergarten through university. Prop. 30 is the governor's proposal to fill the gap in education funding by temporarily raising the sales tax and increasing income taxes for those earning more than $250,000 a year.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/28037">University of California Board of Regents has endorsed Prop. 30</a>, noting that if the initiative fails, the UC system is scheduled to receive a budget reduction of $250 million this year and lose an additional $125 million next year. The UCSC Alumni Council has also endorsed the measure. Please read up on this and other ballot measures, or consider attending an election forum on campus; more information is available <a href="http://urelations.ucsc.edu/units/government/vote/">online</a>. Whatever your position on the candidates and issues, please vote!<br/>
<br/>
Here on campus, we face our own budget challenges. The <a href="http://www.studentunionassembly.org/">Student Union Assembly</a> is hosting a student budget forum on Tuesday, October 23 from 6 - 7 p.m. in the University Center Alumni Room. The SUA does a great job helping inform students about the funding challenges we face, and I encourage students to attend.<br/>
<br/>
Following a suggestion from the Staff Advisory Board, I was recently interviewed by KZSC Radio about the importance of the tax-related ballot measures, my role as executive vice chancellor, and our current student cohort; listen to a <a href="http://www.kzsc.org/blog/2012/10/12/interview-with-ucscs-evc-galloway/">podcast</a> of that interview online. In addition, at the end of this month I will post a brief video on my website about the impact of the tax measures.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I want to let you know that I will continue my quarterly office hours for students this year, beginning October 19, when I will be available for informal conversation at the Global Village Caf&#233; in McHenry Library from noon to 1 p.m. I hope to see you there!</p>

<br/>
Para: Estudiantes, Profesorado y Personal de la UCSC<br/>
De parte de: Campus Provost y Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway<br/>
Sobre: Lo que est&#225; en mi mente este oto&#241;o<br/>
<br/>
Por lo que he visto, el trimestre del oto&#241;o ha tenido un gran comienzo. Me ha impresionado la energ&#237;a y el entusiasmo de nuestra comunidad universitaria en todos los eventos a los que he asistido, desde el move-in al Boardwalk Frolic, el Festival del Oto&#241;o OPERS y la Barbacoa de las y los estudiantes de posgrado. A las estudiantes nuevas y los estudiantes nuevos, al profesorado y al personal: &#161;Bienvenidas y bienvenidos a la Universidad de California en Santa Cruz &#8211;as&#237; es como lo hacemos aqu&#237;!<br/>
<br/>
Hay varios asuntos importantes que quiero estar segura de que est&#225;n bajo su atenci&#243;n. Primeramente, el plazo para <a href="http://www.californiastudentvote.org/register-to-vote-ca">registrarse para votar</a> es el 22 de octubre. La carrera presidencial tiene importantes y a largo plazo implicaciones para la educaci&#243;n superior, as&#237; como las cr&#237;ticas iniciativas electorales que enfrentan las y los votantes de California.<br/>
<br/>
Espec&#237;ficamente, la <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/09/about-prop-30.html">Proposici&#243;n 30</a> tiene implicaciones de financiaci&#243;n para todos los niveles de la educaci&#243;n p&#250;blica en el estado de California, desde preescolar hasta la universidad. La Proposici&#243;n 30 es la propuesta del gobernador Brown para llenar la brecha en el financiamiento de la educaci&#243;n, elevando temporalmente el impuesto sobre las ventas y aumentando el impuesto sobre la renta para las personas que ganan m&#225;s de 250.000 d&#243;lares al a&#241;o.<br/>
<br/>
La <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/28037">Junta de Regentes de la Universidad de California apoya la Proposici&#243;n 30</a> se&#241;alando que si la iniciativa fracasa, el sistema de la Universidad de California est&#225; programado para recibir un recorte presupuestario de $250 millones este a&#241;o y perder un adicional de $125 millones el pr&#243;ximo a&#241;o. El Consejo de Ex-Alumnas/os de la UCSC tambi&#233;n apoya esta iniciativa del gobernador. Por favor, lea sobre &#233;sta y otras iniciativas electorales, o considere asistir a un foro sobre las elecciones en el campus; hay m&#225;s informaci&#243;n disponible <a href="http://urelations.ucsc.edu/units/government/vote/">en l&#237;nea</a>. Cualquiera sea su posici&#243;n sobre los candidatos y las iniciativas, &#161;por favor, vote!<br/>
<br/>
Aqu&#237; en nuestro campus, tambi&#233;n nos enfrentamos con nuestros propios desaf&#237;os presupuestarios. La <a href="http://www.studentunionassembly.org/">Asamblea de la Uni&#243;n de Estudiantes</a>, est&#225; organizando un foro sobre el presupuesto de las/los estudiantes, a realizarse el martes 23 de octubre, de 6 a 7 de la tarde, en la University Center Alumni Room. La Asamblea de la Uni&#243;n de Estudiantes realiza un trabajo magn&#237;fico dando informaci&#243;n a las y los estudiantes sobre los desaf&#237;os de financiaci&#243;n que enfrentamos.&#160; Quiero recomendarles a las y los estudiantes a que asistan a este foro.<br/>
<br/>
Siguiendo las sugerencias de la Junta Asesora del Personal, recientemente tuve una entrevista en la Radio KZSC sobre la importancia de las iniciativas electorales relacionadas con los impuestos, mi papel como vicerrectora ejecutiva (executive vice chancellor) y nuestro cohorte estudiante actual; escuche un <a href="http://www.kzsc.org/blog/2012/10/12/interview-with-ucscs-evc-galloway/">podcast</a> de esta entrevista en l&#237;nea. Adem&#225;s, a fines de este mes, voy a publicar un breve video en mi sitio web sobre el impacto de las medidas o iniciativas fiscales relacionadas con los impuestos.<br/>
<br/>
Por &#250;ltimo, quiero que sepan que voy a continuar en este a&#241;o con mis horas de oficina trimestrales para las y los estudiantes, comenzando el 19 de octubre, cuando estar&#233; disponible para conversaciones informales en el caf&#233; Global Village Caf&#233; en la biblioteca McHenry, desde el mediod&#237;a hasta la una de la tarde. &#161;Espero que nos veamos all&#237;!<br/>

<p>But you will find plenty of sporting spirit, and a student community built around athletic activities. Since 1988, Kevin "Skippy" Givens, 58, has been a key player in the UCSC athletics arena.</p>
<p>He's been the intramural sports supervisor on campus for the past 25 years, and the sports club supervisor for the past 12 years. During that time, he introduced "fut-sal"&#8212;indoor soccer&#8212;to the intramural sports program, as well as self-officiated sports such as co-ed volleyball.</p>
<p>The point of these sports clubs and teams is not to rack up the big wins. The clubs are designed to enhance the student experience on campus.</p>
<p>"Most notably they help create communities," Givens said. "Secondly, they create profound opportunities for leadership. Thirdly, these programs create lifelong friendships.</p>
<p>"A common theme in the UCSC sports clubs is the grassroots, student-initiated love of a particular sport," Givens said.</p>
<p>Students come from every educational discipline. "I try to inspire the student leaders of these teams to be inclusive in nature," he said. "There have been so many interests and academic successes among our team members."</p>
<p>For example, he points with pride to students such as Brooke Miller, a Division I volleyball athlete at UC Berkeley who came to UCSC to work on her Ph.D. in biology. A friend in the Biology Department convinced her to try out cycle racing and join the UCSC cycling team. She ended up winning the Collegiate National Championship shortly after that.</p>
<p>"I haven&#8217;t tracked the graduation rates for sports club athletes, but it's remarkably high," Givens continued. "Many of my students have been Regents Scholars and straight-A students. They owed much of their focus and academic enthusiasm to the balance and quality of life that sports brought them."</p>
<p>Givens came to UCSC by way of Sonoma State University, where he started the intramural, sports club, and recreation program as a student back in the 1980s.</p>
<p>"I had no idea what I was doing, but I had the guts to try it, and as I made mistakes, I learned from them and moved the programs forward," he said. "One of the things I did toward the end of my tenure at SSU was to come and visit UCSC and observe how a 'real' program was run. I knew many of the OPERS folks from attending the big annual Frisbee tournaments that would happen during summer on the East Field. That connection paid off handsomely."</p>
<p>Givens has also been influential off campus, having sparked a strong interest in freestyle Frisbee in Santa Cruz County.&#160;</p>
<p>Givens, who held the course record of 12 under par at DeLaveaga Disc Golf Course for about eight years back in the early 1990s, and has won 14 world titles in freestyle, calls Santa Cruz "a slice of Frisbee heaven. I love helping to put on the annual ultimate tournaments, I love playing the local disc golf courses, and my favorite is still freestyling on the beaches with a firm wind in my face."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/10/images/givens-skippy-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/10/images/givens-skippy-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>givens-skippy-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>givens-skippy-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24747</file-size><width>216</width><height>90</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Kevin "Skippy" Givens</thumb-alt><title>Kevin "Skippy" Givens</title><description>Since 1988, Kevin "Skippy" Givens has been a key player in the UCSC athletics arena.

She has traveled to rural parts of China uncovering stories that would otherwise have been lost. She listened to the tales of 8-year-old girls sold as child brides, and the stories of women who survived famine and became political activists during the Communist Revolution.</p>
<p>Hershatter grew up in the 1950s, during a time when the United States had an "oversimplified view of China," she said. Like many in her generation, she learned about the country from news reports about the U.S. table tennis team's visit to China and Nixon's attempts at diplomacy. She became curious about Asia during the turbulent 1960s.</p>
<p>"I&#8217;m of the generation very much influenced by the Vietnam War," said Hershatter, who is a professor of history and History Department chair. "The other major influence on me was the second wave of feminism in the United States."</p>
<p>In 1979, Hershatter moved to China for two years to work on her Ph.D. dissertation for Stanford, about workers in the north China city of Tianjin. She became part of the first generation of U.S.- based scholars allowed to do field research in China. A subsequent project led her to uncover details about prostitutes in Shanghai. Her book, <em>Dangerous Pleasures,</em> was published in 1997 and later translated into Chinese. She brought a suppressed world to life by drawing from an unusual variety of sources&#8212;from gossip columns, guidebooks, and interviews to medical records.</p>
<p>Her methods sometimes resemble those of an anthropologist rather than a typical historian. Her grass-roots approach to recovering oral histories shows a side of China that has seldom been explored by scholars before. She is one of the few Western women to travel to some of these far-flung areas. She teamed up with her research partner, Gao Xiaoxian, and spent more than 10 years making her way through the rural Shaanxi province. She spoke to 72 elderly women&#8212;and a few surviving men&#8212;about their lives before and after the Revolution.</p>
<p>Last year, she published <em>The Gender of Memory: Rural Women and China&#8217;s Collective Past</em> (University of California Press, 2011). The book is filled with stories of the poor, rural women who were left out of history books. Many of these women never had an opportunity to share their life stories before.</p>
<p>"My work is really looking at the connections between 'Big History' and the daily life and local consciousness of these rural women," Hershatter said.</p>
<p>Hershatter's groundbreaking work has helped to influence some Chinese historians and the way they conduct their research. More academics in Asia are starting to write down the oral history of underrepresented people before it's lost for good.</p>
<p>"If you look at my work and the work by historians in China, we're having diverse but overlapping conversations," said Hershatter.</p>
<p>Hershatter holds the title of distinguished professor, having climbed to the top of the ladder in academia with her impressive teaching and publishing record, said Bill Ladusaw, dean of humanities, who describes her as "one of the most distinguished faculty members on campus" and one of the world's most expert scholars on Chinese women's history.</p>
<p>Last year, Hershatter served as president of the Association for Asian Studies. Her recognition in the fields of history and women's studies helps boost UCSC&#8217;s academic and teaching reputation, said Ladusaw.</p>
<p>Hershatter has been selected to give the Faculty Research Lecture, the top honor bestowed by the UCSC Academic Senate. She was honored at the <a href="founders-celebration-dinner-2012-feature-story.xml">Founders Day gala dinner</a> in October and will deliver her talk on February 12, 2013.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/10/images/gail-hershatter.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/10/images/gail-hershatter.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gail-hershatter.jpg</name><display-name>gail-hershatter.jpg</display-name><file-size>8646</file-size><width>216</width><height>90</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Gail Hershatter</thumb-alt><title>Gail Hershatter</title><description>A specialist in modern Chinese social and cultural history who has pioneered field research and oral history among Chinese women.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6705b8ae807270462ddb1d1c3a309736"><name>rev-fall-12-alumni-aronson</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Profile / Hal Aronson: Shining a light on women's health </title><summary>Hal Aronson toils in a backyard workshop in Berkeley in order to save lives in Africa.&#13;

<p>What he's doing seems wildly simple: He is refining a portable solar system that can power LED lights in hospitals and clinics.</p>
<p>But giving doctors the ability to see and treat patients in places where electricity is spotty or nonexistent comes close to a miracle. Listen to Aronson and his obstetrician-gynecologist wife, Laura Stachel, describe scenes of desperate need, and the importance of their work becomes clear.</p>
<p>For instance, they recall the story of a pregnant woman whose uterus had ruptured during labor and was turned away from an African hospital because it was night and doctors could not see well enough to treat her.</p>
<p>"Light is life," said Aronson simply.</p>
<p>Aronson, who earned a bachelor's degree in politics (Cowell '79) and a Ph.D. in sociology from UCSC in 1997, is co-founder with Stachel of a nonprofit called We Care Solar (wecaresolar.org).</p>
<p>Its roots go back to 2008 when Aronson, a self-taught solar engineer, got an email from Stachel, who was part of a public-health research program in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Stachel described having to stand by helplessly while a pregnant woman with a condition readily treatable in the U.S. fought for her life because doctors could not see well enough to aid her.</p>
<p>She asked Aronson if he could help.</p>
<p>"Designing a solution was pretty basic for me," said Aronson. Within a few weeks, he built a suitcase-sized solar power system, which Stachel could carry on a plane when she returned to Africa.</p>
<p>Four years later, 200 "solar suitcases" have been mounted in clinics and hospitals in 20 countries, with 200 more slated to be installed thanks to a recent grant.</p>
<p>And while statistics on the project's success are not yet available, the first hospital to receive solar electricity from the couple's efforts reported its maternal death rate had dropped 70 percent, according to Stachel.</p>
<p>The suitcases, which cost $1,500 each and can power not only lights but also simple medical equipment, have gone through six iterations as Aronson worked to make them more durable and easier to use.</p>
<p>"Make it simple, make it plug-and-play, and make it easy to maintain," Aronson said. Without those specifications, he said, We Care Solar's portable energy system might end up like other well-intentioned technology brought to Africa: broken and discarded.</p>
<p>Just back from a trip to Uganda, where Aronson scaled rickety hand-built ladders to install solar panels for units, he said one of the project's goals is also to train people to maintain them. Not only does that training keep the mini power plants running, but it also provides experience that can lead to better jobs for locals.</p>
<p>This kind of work touches Aronson's soul. It's a value he said he learned while at UC Santa Cruz. "There was a great spirit among the students then to create a positive experience in the world," he said.</p>
<p>Aronson's UCSC roots run deep: His father is emeritus professor of psychology Elliot Aronson. In addition, his son, stepdaughter, and three siblings also attended UCSC.</p>
<p>Sitting in his cluttered workshop, Aronson told of a doctor who took one of the couple's power systems to a small village in DR Congo.</p>
<p>The doctor arrived in the middle of a cholera outbreak, which usually would have left 50 to 80 percent of his patients dead. But, because he had light, the physician was able to monitor patients and administer IVs throughout the dark African nights.</p>
<p>All 126 of his patients lived.</p>
<p>When Aronson heard the story, he cried.</p>

<p>"We are the stewards of a precious, pale-blue dot," Rees said during his remarks on Friday afternoon, referring to the Earth as it looks from space.</p>
<p>Any one of the topics mentioned in Rees's talk would be worthy of an all-semester, in-depth astronomy class at UCSC. But his presentation, "A Cosmic Perspective on the 21st Century," was meant to be taken as an overview and an appetizer for stargazers, designed to stimulate curiosity and invite deeper exploration.&#160;</p>
<p>Self-effacing humor decreased the intimidation factor, and so did the accessible graphics, which sometimes elicited gasps from the audience, including an extremely sped-up simulation of galaxies colliding, with pyrotechnic results.&#160;</p>
<p>Addressing the audience at the UCSC Music Recital Hall on Friday, Rees, the United Kingdom's Astronomer Royal, made his speech feel close, informal, and intimate, as if he was standing among friends.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was a kind of homecoming for Rees; along with Chancellor George Blumenthal, who is a renowned astrophysicist,&#160; and UCSC professors Sandra Faber and Joel Primack, Rees developed the "Cold dark matter" theory of galaxy formation in 1984.</p>
<p>That evening, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/10/founders-celebration-dinner-2012-feature-story.html">during the Founders Celebration Dinner at the Cocoanut Grove in Santa Cruz,</a> Rees was presented with UCSC's Foundation Medal, along with co-honorees Gordon and Betty Moore, founders of the philanthropic Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.&#160;</p>
<p>While astronomers grapple with vast stretches of time, Rees said that they are also human, and so they fret as much as anyone about what happens next week.&#160;</p>
<p>Most astronomers take no stock in those who consider humans "the culmination of the evolutionary tree," he said. "This hardly seems credible &#8230; Any creatures witnessing the sun&#8217;s demise 6 billion years from now will not be human."</p>
<p>But humans, at least for the time being, are the apex species on this planet, at least when it comes to deciding the fate of other creatures, he said.</p>
<p>"This is the first century in which one species&#8212;ours&#8212;has had the Earth's future in its hands, and the stakes are getting higher."</p>
<p>The possibility of thermonuclear destruction is just one concern among many. He also spoke of more insidious troubles including unsustainable pressures on natural resources, and the far-ranging human footprint, which can tear out entire pages from the book of life "before anybody reads it."</p>
<p>By 2050, he said, the planet will have between 8.5 billion and 10 billion people, with most of the growth in the developing world. Even now, humans use up 40 percent of the Earth's biomass.</p>
<p>Untenable problems such as human-influenced global warming are difficult to address because of "next day" pressures on politicians who are concerned about short-term results, including the next election, and stockholders, who want their investments to pay off. "Can our sympathies become more international and more long-term?" he asked.</p>
<p>As an example of this possibility, he spoke of a 900-year-old cathedral he loves to visit in England. Most of its builders never traveled more than 50 miles in their lifetime, and had lives of deprivation.&#160;</p>
<p>The original builders did not live long enough to see the structure's completion, and yet they labored to produce something that elevated spirits nearly a millennium later, he said</p>
<p>Rees said that no one expects "any very exciting life" in our solar system. "The prospects are much more exciting if we broaden our gaze to the realm of the stars," he said.&#160;</p>
<p>Many of those stars have "retinues of planets" orbiting them, and astronomers have figured out a way to detect the presence of those planets indirectly, he said. Are any of those planets occupied? It is difficult because scientists understand evolution but don't have a firm grasp of life's origins, Rees said. Was the beginning of life "a rare fluke" or something scientists would hope to find in planets with environments similar to Earth?&#160;</p>
<p>While Rees said there is no way of knowing for sure, he still gets letters from people who claim they have seen UFOs. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been visited.</p>
<p>"I tell them, if these aliens had the high-tech expertise, would they just greet a few welcoming cranks, make a few circles in cornfields, and go away again?" he said. "The second thing I tell these people is to write to each other and not write to me.</p>
<p>If those E.T.s actually exist out there somewhere, it is possible that "the cultural gap" would be too broad for humans to communicate with them. &#8220;The philosopher Wittgenstein famously said, &#8216;if I lion could speak, we couldn&#8217;t understand it&#8217; &#8230; There&#8217;s no chance of snappy repartee, as it were.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, these aliens, &#8220; even if they come from Planet Zog, and have seven tentacles,&#8221; &#160;would have to be made from the same atoms as humans are, gaze out at the same cosmos, and trace their origins to the big bang, he said.&#160;</p>
<p>Rees spoke with a combination of caution and enthusiasm about manned space flight. Referring to satellite technology, high-powered telescopes, and space probes, Rees said he saw no purpose of sending people into space.&#160;</p>
<p>Then he added an important caveat. &#8220;But as a human, I am an enthusiast of space flight.&#8221; He said hoped the time would come when people will walk around on Mars, and praised private companies that could send paying customers into space for relatively low costs.</p>
<p>"But I would avoid the phrase 'space tourism' because it makes it seem everyday and understates the risk," he added. "It must be sold as a dangerous sport. Don't ever expect (space) emigration. We&#8217;re kidding ourselves if we think that going into space will solve the Earth&#8217;s problems."</p>
<p>He pointed out that the most hospitable alternative planet in our solar system is "far less inviting" than the most barren reaches of Antarctica.&#160;</p>
<p>Rees has just completed eight years as Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. He has been president of the Royal Society, a fellowship of the world's most eminent scientists, and is a member of the House of Lords. For 10 years he directed the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge. Besides his research papers on cosmology and high-energy astrophysics, he has penned numerous articles on scientific and general subjects.&#160;</p>
<p>The latest of his eight books is <em>From Here to Infinity: A Vision of 21st Century Science.</em></p>
<p>Prior to Rees's speech, UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal introduced him as a friend and colleague, as well as "a thread running through all modern astronomy." Blumenthal referred to Rees's more than 500 research papers.</p>
<p>"A high percentage of them have real and lasting impact," Blumenthal said.

<br/>
But each award winner has shown a combination of extraordinary achievement and a strong sense of social consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
The event drew a crowd of 350 people to the Cocoanut Grove in Santa Cruz last Friday night. Like many other Founders celebration events, including the Founders Forum, this year's dinner sold out early and quickly.<br/>
<br/>
UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal, on hand to congratulate each award winner, said they all had one key value in common: They are part of a shared quest "to leave the world a better place than when we found it."<br/>
<br/>
Blumenthal started off the evening by highlighting the latest achievements of the still-young UCSC campus, which will turn 50 three years from now.<br/>
<br/>
"Have you heard our newest distinction?" he said. "Of all the universities around the world under the age of 50, we were recently ranked seventh best. That's us&#8212;young, smart, and beautiful. And modest, too."<br/>
<br/>
As Blumenthal mentioned the scope and the heft of UCSC's most recent accomplishments, he also highlighted some of the themes of Founders Celebrations past and present, "from the molten core of the Earth to the depths of the Pacific Ocean, to the most distant objects seen in the universe."<br/>
<br/>
Master of ceremonies Doug Ley, who is managing partner of local development company Redtree Properties, spoke of UCSC's key importance to the community and the need to support the UC system.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm a native of this fair city, and a member of the Santa Cruz High School Class of '69," Ley said. "The greatest gift this community has ever received was the UC Regents' decision to start a campus on the Cowell Ranch. Nothing else was even close. Tonight we are gathered to celebrate our shared good fortune."<br/>
<br/>
The black-tie-optional event was a chance to mingle with educators, faculty, civic leaders, philanthropists, entrepreneurs, pioneer alumni, donors, artists, and journalists while celebrating the founding principles of UC Santa Cruz and recognizing outstanding achievement.<br/>
<br/>
Honored at the event were:</p>
<p>Foundation Medal: Martin Rees, the United Kingdom's Astronomer Royal, who has just completed eight years as Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. He has been president of the Royal Society, a fellowship of the world's most eminent scientists, and is a member of the House of Lords. For 10 years he directed the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge.<br/>
<br/>
Foundation Medal: Gordon and Betty Moore. Gordon Moore is co-founder of Intel Corporation and chairman emeritus of the corporation's board of directors. A California native, he also co-founded Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957. Moore and his wife, Betty Moore, founded the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
Fiat Lux Award: Philanthropists George Ow Jr. and Gail Michaelis-Ow. George Ow Jr. is a native Santa Cruzan, businessman, publisher, and boogie boarder who spent his early years in the former Chinatown on the banks of the San Lorenzo River. Gail Michaelis-Ow came to Santa Cruz in 1970 to attend UC Santa Cruz and stayed. She is a nurse practitioner at Planned Parenthood and also served on the UC Foundation and Shakespeare Santa Cruz boards.<br/>
<br/>
Alumni Achievement Award: Shannon M. Brownlee. a writer and essayist whose groundbreaking work on health-care issues has appeared in major newspapers and magazines across the country. Her book, Overtreated: Why Too Much Medicine is Making Us Sicker and Poorer, was a semi-finalist for the National Book Award. Her current research focuses on health-care costs and delivery system reform.<br/>
<br/>
Faculty Research Lecturer: Gail Hershatter, is a specialist in modern Chinese social and cultural history who has pioneered field research and oral history among Chinese women. Her books have covered topics including the formation of the working class in Tianjin in Northern China, prostitution in Shanghai, and the construction of socialism in China in the '50s and '60s.</p>
<p>In a video presentation, UCSC astronomy and astrophysics faculty hailed the generosity of Martin Rees, along with the heft of his work.</p>
<p>"Martin's work is always important, never fluff, always luminous, always bright," astronomy professor Greg Laughlin said. "You know if you study his work, you are going to be rewarded."<br/>
<br/>
Rees said that it was "a huge pleasure and privilege to be here and listen to half truths being said about me. I always extol the UC system as something we ought to respect far more than the Ivy League. It combines excellence with access and opportunities for everyone."<br/>
<br/>
He said it was a privilege to have written research papers with seven UCSC faculty members.</p>
<p>Earlier that day, at the sixth annual Foundation Forum, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/10/founders-forum-martin-rees.html">Rees enthralled the audience at the UCSC Music Recital Hall on campus with a talk that examined the 21st century from a cosmic perspective.</a><br/>
<br/>
Brownlee&#160; took to the stage to accept her UCSC Alumni Association Award after a brief video showed some of her career highlights as a writer. In an on-screen interview, John Wilkes, founding director of UCSC's Science Communication Program, praised the drive and focus of Brownlee, one of his former students.<br/>
<br/>
"She got it right away," he said. She went right to the heart of the story." He also praised her fearlessness toward the medical establishment.<br/>
<br/>
A biographical video showcased the achievements of Faculty Research Lecturer award winner Gail Hershatter. William Ladusaw, dean of humanities, called her "the paradigm of UCSC faculty&#8212;an outstanding researcher and professor." Joe Konopelski, chair of the Academic Senate, praised her for "listening to those who have been ignored."<br/>
<br/>
Hershatter thanked UCSC for providing "the most intellectually stimulating environment I&#8217;ve ever been in."<br/>
<br/>
The evening was also a chance to recognize those whose generosity makes groundbreaking research possible at UCSC. The Ows were praised for their support of scholarships and the arts, and, in particular, Shakespeare Santa Cruz, while the Moores were praised for advancing knowledge by funding valuable scientific research at UCSC. A grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore foundation established UCSC's Laboratory for Adaptive Optics.<br/>

<p>His long hair clouding around him, his hands posed prayer-like, Collins was captured in the moment of wondering whether the project on which he had worked for close to five years would be a spectacular success or a humiliating disaster.</p>
<p>That photo of Collins (Porter '85, physics and theater arts) became a national symbol after the August 5 touchdown, not only of remarkable accomplishment, but also of the new face of aerospace. No more men with crew cuts and ties &#224; la Apollo 13. This group had women, and guys with mohawks and long hair. They were cool and adventurous&#8212;they were mavericks, just as Collins is in real life.</p>
<p>Besides his work at the Jet Propulsion Lab, which nestles in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains near Los Angeles, the 53-year-old polymath is also an actor who has appeared in numerous plays. He is a dancer/ choreographer, a soccer player, an autocross racer and a musician in an indie-rock band.</p>
<p>"I'm curious about things in a cross-disciplinary way," he said simply.</p>
<p>The son of an Emmy-winning cinematographer and a music industry professional, Collins was fascinated both by space and entertainment.</p>
<p>He chose UC Santa Cruz because of its astrophysics and theater arts programs.</p>
<p>"It was a place where the physics people wouldn't freak out when I put on tights to take modern dance," he said.</p>
<p>His advisor, Physics Professor Emeritus Peter Scott, allowed him to do a rather unorthodox senior thesis on orbital rendezvous, which required him to learn computer programming. "He was very self-motivated to do unusual things, and to do them well," Scott said of Collins.</p>
<p>The skills Collins acquired at UCSC landed him a job after graduation with a "mom-andpop" aerospace company. In 1992, he was hired at the Jet Propulsion Lab.</p>
<p>His job as an "attitude control" engineer is to keep spacecraft pointed in the right direction, perform trajectory corrections, and figure out "what the heck just happened," he said.</p>
<p>On the Deep Space One project, for instance, Collins helped fly the revolutionary, ion-propelled spacecraft toward the comet Borrelly. On the way, however, the spacecraft's star-tracker instrument failed, basically blinding those guiding it. Over the next months, Collins and five others cobbled together a way to successfully fly the craft without the crucial sensor.</p>
<p>When Curiosity developed a strange "wiggle" as it flew toward Mars, Collins solved that problem too. Heaters on the propellant tanks caused the shimmy, he said. It didn't interfere with the mission.</p>
<p>During his career, Collins has helped deliver twin rovers to the surface of Mars, capture spectacular photos of Jupiter and its moons, send a spacecraft on a flyby of the Hartley-2 comet, and pilot the rover, Curiosity, to Mars with an innovative "sky-crane" landing system that allows spacecraft to settle in smaller and more discovery-rich areas.</p>
<p>Besides rocket science, Collins also regularly hits the stage as part of TACIT, Caltech's resident theater company. He has done Shakespeare and musicals. In 2009, he played Galileo in Life of Galileo. He also is fullback for the JPL Cosmics soccer team, races his Mazda Miata through tricky autocross courses, plays the eerie-sounding theremin in a band called Artichoke, and choreographs dance routines.</p>
<p>It was the openness of UCSC, he said, that allowed him to explore his varied interests, and eventually land his "dream job."</p>
<p>"At other, more structured schools, I think I could have gotten sideways with their expectations," he said in a telephone interview. "Plus, Santa Cruz was a glorious place to live."</p>

(Photos by Peggy Townsend)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Yes! Though little-known, the UCSC cheer squad supports Banana Slug teams with an upbeat attitude and fearless acrobatics</article-subhead><article-text><p>When most people say, "UCSC has a cheerleading team," they put a question mark at the end of the sentence.</p>
<p>"A lot of people on campus don't even know we exist," admitted Lai Saelee, a 19-year-old sociology major, as she sat amid tables of fencers and baseball players, signing up prospective squad members at the recent OPERS fall festival.</p>
<p>Whether because urging a slow-moving mollusk to "go, fight, win" seems like an impossible task or because UCSC is not considered a collegiate-sports powerhouse, the Banana Slug cheer squad has been something of a quiet presence on campus since it was formed in 1996.</p>
<p>But Cierra Hamilton (Kresge '14, linguistics and global economics) and Danny Williams (College Eight '15, psychology) want to change that.</p>
<p>The co-captains of the 20-person squad, who both confessed to upbeat and determined personalities, said they want to make more appearances at sports events and also compete at the USA Cheer College Nationals in March. Their plan is not only to put cheerleading in the spotlight but also to have it appreciated for the athletic work it is.</p>
<p>Dressed in a gold and navy blue uniform, Williams ticks off the sport's dangers: concussions, sprained ankles, broken wrists, black eyes, bloody noses.</p>
<p>"During a performance, people don't know how many times we've fallen or gotten smacked in the face," said Karen Pi&#241;on (Stevenson '15, psychology), who cheered at Santa Maria High School before coming to Santa Cruz. "They don't see the blood."</p>
<p>Indeed, cheerleading isn't your grandparents' pampered, pom-pom-waving activity any more. With moves like "liberties" and "basket tosses," today's yell leaders are more like top-notch acrobats.</p>
<p>UCSC's squad, for instance, consists of bases, back-spots, and fliers. Bases and back-spots are the strength positions. They support the fliers, who are tossed, confetti-like, into the air, where they perform an intricate trick before plunging back down to be caught by their teammates.</p>
<p>"Doing crazy, scary stuff is my thing," said 21-year-old Michelle Shirley, a biology and environmental studies major at College Eight who was a competitive gymnast in South Lake Tahoe before she became a flier on the UCSC squad.</p>
<p>In fact, fliers can be tossed so high, the Slug squad has to practice on racquetball courts "because they're the only rooms with a high-enough ceiling," explained cheer member Courtney Boudreaux (Stevenson '15, human biology).</p>
<p>With the inherent danger, hours of practice, and the fact cheerleaders must foot the $250 bill for their uniforms (which does not include pom-poms, bows, or sweatshirts), one might think it would be hard to find people willing to try out for the sport.</p>
<p>But on a recent Saturday, 19 women and one man were on the East Field learning routines, each vying for one of eight open spots on the team. Most had been cheerleaders at their high schools, and several said school pride and being part of a community drew them to the team.</p>
<p>"Cheer gives me a lot of life lessons," said Pi&#241;on as she watched potential squad members throwing right punches and high Vs. "There are things we might not be comfortable doing, but we do it anyway. It gives you a determination to stick with things."</p>
<p>The cheer squad "serves as a high-profile, energetic, positive reflection of UCSC students," said Kevin "Skippy" Givens, intramural sports and sports club advisor.</p>
<p>"The key difference between a 'powerhouse' sports-centered university and UCSC is that we are participatory. We emphasize getting out, getting involved, and being active instead of observing," Givens said. "The cheer team is a fantastic role model in that regard."</p>

<br/>
&#8220;I actually turned off the camera and ran. I just escaped. There were about 200 pounds of gunpowder, but luckily it didn&#8217;t catch on fire.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Vazquez was high up in the Peruvian Andes filming <em>Playing with Fire</em> (Jugando con Fuego), a kaleidoscopic portrait of the small town of Celend&#237;n--a traditional community whose inhabitants celebrate the annual fiesta of its patron saint with candlelit parades, brass bands&#8230;and spectacular fireworks.</p>
<p>Fortunately nobody got killed, but there were a few close calls. Vazquez noted that the town drunk did get severely burned when fireworks exploded under his armpit.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never know what&#8217;s going to happen,&#8221; said Vazquez. &#8220;We were there a little more than three weeks filming the fiestas."</p>
<p>"The film is a tribute to the town, capturing all the spectacles, rituals and ceremonies&#8230;and all the eccentricities of the characters,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><strong><em>Playing With Fire</em></strong> will have its premiere showing on Monday, October 22, at the Pacific Rim Festival in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The screening takes place at the Rio Theater, beginning at 5 p.m. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>The film was co-produced by former longtime UCSC assistant arts dean Keith Muscutt, who has spent the past 20 years as an anthropological explorer in Northern Peru.</p>
<p>Vazquez said it was Muscutt who inspired him to make the film.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keith brought back pictures and videos of the grinding of gunpowder&#8212;the same way the Chinese were making gunpowder in the 15th century,&#8221; Vazquez recalled. &#8220;And it struck me how these people with little or nothing created a spectacle of light.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I realized as we were filming that this was their cinema in the past&#8212;before there was cinema,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
Muscutt was instrumental in pre-production, using his contacts to coordinate small plane flights, drivers and equipment to navigate the remote dirt roads.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Most of the time</strong>, Vazquez was filming while Muscutt recorded sound with wireless microphones. Occasionally, when two cameras were simultaneously needed for things like reaction shots, Muscutt would man a second camera.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;A technique that worked well for us was that I could act as a "spotter" for Gustavo--attracting his attention to peripheral scenes that he might not have noticed with one eye glued to the viewfinder,&#8221; said Muscutt. (&#8216;Psst... three o'clock high... the character on the ladder...&#8217;).&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The two-man crew financed the film entirely out of their own pockets&#8212;paying for all travel, equipment and post-production.<br/>
<br/>
They ended up shooting 30 hours of footage that was ultimately trimmed down to 54 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I'm usually more interested in the process of creation than in the outcome,&#8221; Muscutt reflected. &#8220;By the time I finish a project, it's usually about as interesting as a stuffed animal&#8230;inanimate.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;But for some reason I keep going back to this one,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It still lives and breathes for me.&#8221;</p>

Reufer)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Among the oddities of the outer solar system are the middle-sized moons of Saturn, a half-dozen icy bodies dwarfed by Saturn's massive moon Titan. According to a new model for the origin of the Saturn system, these middle-sized moons were spawned during giant impacts in which several major satellites merged to form Titan.</p>
<p>Erik Asphaug, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will present this new hypothesis October 19 at the <a href="http://www.psi.edu/dps12/">annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences</a> of the American Astronomical Society in Reno, Nevada. Asphaug and his coauthor, Andreas Reufer of the University of Bern, Switzerland, also describe their model in detail in a paper to be published in <em>Icarus</em> (in press).</p>
<p>Asphaug and Reufer propose that the Saturn system started with a family of major satellites comparable to the four large moons of Jupiter (known as the Galilean moons, discovered by Galileo in 1610). The Galilean moons account for 99.998 percent of the mass in Jupiter's satellite system; although it has dozens of small satellites, Jupiter has no middle-sized moons. The new model may explain why the two systems are so different.</p>
<p>"We think that the giant planets got their satellites kind of like the Sun got its planets, growing like miniature solar systems and ending with a stage of final collisions," Asphaug said. "In our model for the Saturn system, we propose that Titan grew in a couple of giant impacts, each one combining the masses of the colliding bodies, while shedding a small family of middle-sized moons."</p>
<p>Earth is thought to have undergone a similar kind of giant impact, in which our planet gained the last ten percent of its mass and spawned the moon. Just as our moon is thought to be made out of material similar to Earth's rocky mantle, the middle-sized moons of Saturn are made of material similar to Titan's icy mantle, Asphaug said.</p>
<p>"Our model explains the diversity of these ice-rich moons and the evidence for their very active geology and dynamics," he said. "It also explains a puzzling fact about Titan, in that a giant impact would give it a high orbital eccentricity."</p>
<p>Asphaug and Reufer used computer simulations to study the giant impact scenario, and they found that mergers of satellites the size of the Galilean moons can liberate ice-rich spiral arms, mostly from the outer layers of the smaller of the colliding moons. Gravitational clumping of the spiral arms then leads to the formation of clumps with sizes and compositions that resemble Saturn's middle-sized moons.</p>
<p>"These satellite collisions are a regime that is not very well understood, so the modeling opens up new possibilities in general for planet formation," Reufer said.</p>
<p>The proposed mergers might have occurred as the final act in the process of satellite formation. Alternatively, Saturn may have had a stable system of Galilean-like satellites that was later disrupted by the possibly chaotic migration of the giant planets, as described in the popular "Nice model" of the solar system. A late origin has the advantage of explaining some of the most striking features of the Saturn system.</p>
<p>"What makes the Saturn system so beautiful and unique could be its youth," Asphaug said. "While we don't have a preferred timeframe for this origin scenario to play out, it could have happened recently if something came along to destabilize the Saturn system, triggering the collisional mergers that formed Titan. This 'something' could have been the close passage of a marauding Uranus and Neptune, which is part of the Nice model."</p>
<p>Asphaug acknowledged a couple of dynamical issues raised by the new model. The clumps spawned from the giant impacts might get swept up into the accretion of Titan, rather than evolving into separate moons with their own stable orbits. Additional simulations of the dynamical evolution of the complicated, accreting system are needed to further explore and validate the model. But Asphaug said new data from NASA's Cassini mission on the geophysics of Saturn's moons will provide the ultimate tests.</p>
<p>"Our model makes strong predictions for how Titan was assembled, what the middle-sized moons are made of, and how they started out as rapidly spinning clumps of ice-rich material," he said. "So it's testable. These little moons could provide the clues telling us what happened, and when."</p>

The resolution was proposed by Foundation President Ken Doctor.</p>
<p>The board also voted to donate $10,000 to the "Yes on Prop. 30" campaign. (Trustees used earnings from foundation investments to make the donation; no state funds or donations to the campus were used.)</p>
<p>California voters in November will be asked to decide on Proposition 30, an initiative that would raise new state revenue through temporary increases in the state sales tax and the personal income tax on those who earn $250,000 or more per year. It is sponsored by Gov. Jerry Brown and is part of the 2012-13 budget approved by state lawmakers.</p>
<p>The University of California Board of Regents earlier endorsed Prop. 30, noting that if the initiative fails, the UC system is scheduled to receive a budget reduction of $250 million this year and lose an additional $125 million next year. (Please see complete story from&#160;<a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/28244">UC's Office of the President</a>.)</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, the Alumni Council has also endorsed the measure.</p>
<p>Prop. 30 has active campaign organizations on both sides. Opponents of the measure say that the initiative would harm small businesses; they emphasize that it raises taxes on all Californians, not just the wealthy. Supporters say it will help stabilize the state's fiscal picture and prevent deep budget cuts to public education. A majority vote will decide the issue on November 6.</p>

Herman Blake sat down to talk about the transformative power of education. Their talk, which covered the importance of empathy and the enduring multicultural vision that guided the creation and growth of Oakes, moved many in the audience to tears. The following is an essay by Blake re-creating the talk.</em>&#160;</p>
<p>When I joined the faculty of Cowell College in 1966, I thought my future path was clear and certain. My colleagues were young, hopeful, intelligent, and intellectual. They welcomed me into their company, and I felt privileged.</p>
<p>I could have stayed at Cowell forever. But deep inside me there was restiveness. Given my humble beginnings and the racial limits I had experienced in the years before UCSC, I felt ill at ease enjoying the boundless freedom of the present. I wanted to extend opportunity to many in the general community who would love to be where I was.</p>
<p>When Chancellor Dean McHenry asked me to partner with politics and community studies professor Ralph Guzman in planning a new college, I had my doubts. I had been on campus for just three years. My courses were just beginning to come together; while my research plans were dormant, my trajectory was academic scholarship, not administrative leadership. However, after counsel with Berkeley mentors, I accepted the invitation.</p>
<p>Ralph Guzman&#8217;s dreams for the Latino community paralleled mine for the African American community. We both agreed our plans should be wholly inclusive in spite of some community pressures to limit our focus.</p>
<p>We needed a core group of faculty to do the initial planning, so we carefully listed those on campus we knew shared our values and goals and sought them out.</p>
<p>When Oakes College opened in 1972, we still did not have a name, but I was satisfied with College VII. We had a small contingent of faculty and about 250 students. The faculty was a source of great comfort&#8212;incredible minds, great teachers, and totally committed to the university as well as the college.</p>
<p>There were about 20 or so minority students among that first group. Eventually we had a faculty that was about 30 percent women and 50 percent minority, many of them in the sciences.</p>
<p>Our goal of promoting the sciences among minority students began to take shape&#8212;and it was successful.</p>
<p>The doubts and fears that kept me awake at night, and often troubled my days, were eventually stilled by the visions, hopes, and dreams that soared into the stratosphere. Students who arrived with limited preparation responded well&#8212;they not only overcame, they prevailed.</p>
<p>They are now attorneys, teachers, social workers, physicians, entrepreneurs, and college professors.</p>
<p>In 2012 I was invited to spend a week at Oakes College in celebration of its 40th anniversary. I went to classes and seminars throughout the campus; met with faculty members, students, staff, and community members; and attended gatherings at the homes of the provosts of Oakes and Cowell colleges.</p>
<p>Having left UCSC in 1984 to assume the presidency of Tougaloo College in Mississippi, I had little understanding of the extraordinary changes in the college and the university. The chancellor, George Blumenthal, had been one of the original faculty in Oakes College. An astrophysicist, he was an outstanding teacher with a sensitive soul, and all students&#8212;particularly minority students&#8212;flourished in his classes. It was a huge change from 1972. Intellectual understandings we anxiously sought then were now intuitively understood.</p>
<p>Everywhere I went, it was like stepping into the middle of a dream.</p>
<p>There is no limit to what UCSC can become.</p>

<p>The snow doesn't hold much interest for them. During vacation time, they would much rather lie out on a beach. Christine likes to look at the waves, while Rob enjoys diving into the depths.</p>
<p>It's a beautiful world down there, but its future is far from guaranteed. During their repeated visits to ocean waters across the globe, the Holos have learned about the problems facing marine habitats, including the dangers of plastics and overfishing.</p>
<p>After observing the situation firsthand, Rob and Christine Holo decided to take action, giving $1 million to support the Center for Ocean Health at UCSC's Long Marine Lab, a premier research facility for coastal conservation, policy, and research.</p>
<p>Built entirely with private support, the center opened in 2001 with 23,000 square feet of labs, offices, and classrooms, providing much-needed facilities for faculty, researchers, and students.</p>
<p>A growing number of researchers and students have been attracted to the center, leading to a pressing need for additional space. The Holos met as undergraduates at UCSC in 1987, and have maintained a strong connection to the Santa Cruz area. They credit their time at UCSC with their success in life as well as their environmental consciousness.</p>
<p>"We received a world-class education at a bargain price," says Rob Holo (Crown '87, history), who is a partner in the law firm of Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett. "We feel a sense of wanting to give back to a place that gave so much to us."</p>
<p>The Holos are raising their two children with an appreciation and passion for science and the environment. Their son is attending CalTech in the fall. Their daughter is a junior in high school and has attended summer science camps in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
<p>They credit their daughter for deepening their environmental consciousness.</p>
<p>"Our daughter is really interested in the ocean&#8212;she's truly the environmentalist in the family," says Christine Holo (Oakes '90, biology).</p>
<p>When the Holos started researching the needs of UCSC and found an opportunity to contribute to the Center for Ocean Health, they decided it was a perfect fit.</p>
<p>The Center for Ocean Health expansion will provide 16,000 square feet of additional facilities for interdisciplinary research and education focused on marine conservation science and policy. The total cost of the planned expansion is $12 million.</p>
<p>Despite living 3,000 miles from their alma mater, the Holos have maintained strong ties to UCSC, and have recently "reconnected" with the university. They have taken numerous family trips to Santa Cruz, and even celebrated their 20th anniversary in the town where they met. They plan to return in March to visit the Center for Ocean Health.</p>
<p>Christine Holo says she hopes the gift will inspire other alumni to support the university. They are helping to fund a project that will expand an existing classroom into a lecture room that can accommodate larger classes and seminars.</p>
<p>The new lecture room will be named the Holo Family Lecture Room.</p>
<p>"We very much wanted to contribute to education, especially to UC," says Christine Holo. "We hope it will serve an entire generation of students."&#160;</p>

What life lesson did you take away from the experience?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tracie Burruel:</strong> My first roommate is one of my closest friends. Life lessons &#8230; time helps you remember the good things. Stay in touch with the ones you like, you may never see them again. If you come home to spaghetti on the ceiling, get new roommates. Look out for each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What wisdom did you gain from the wildlife during your time on campus?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Andrea Wagman-Christian:</strong> It&#8217;s what the wildlife did for my son. He is a more whole person &#8230; between the redwoods, ferns and raccoons, the pine needles underfoot and the sweet smell in the air, I know he has a deeper spirit than if he had stayed in the city for college. He will always long to reproduce that his whole life. Welcome to all the new Banana Slugs! Steve Raphael: one of the best days of my life &#8230; being dropped off at my dorm in august of 1990. a new chapter started &#8230; and UCSC was just perfect.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What&#8217;s your best memory of graduation weekend?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Kate Grimes:</strong> 1980&#8212;Oakes, Patrick and I counting down the days to our wedding, 1982, my Oakes graduation, and going out for chocolate madness at the Saturn Cafe. We came back in 2010 for our son&#8217;s graduation from Kresge. good times all.</p>
<p><strong>Ryn Schneider:</strong> leaving our house on Archer Dr. and walking to take the shuttle to Porter College wearing our cap and gowns as a solid group of friends that stuck together for 4 years through it all. Class of 2004, thanks for the memories!</p>

Image credit: NASA/HST</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A comprehensive study of hundreds of galaxies observed by the Keck telescopes in Hawaii and NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has revealed an unexpected pattern of change that extends back 8 billion years, or more than half the age of the universe.</p>
<p>"Astronomers thought disk galaxies in the nearby universe had settled into their present form by about 8 billion years ago, with little additional development since," said Susan Kassin, an astronomer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the study's lead researcher. "The trend we've observed instead shows the opposite, that galaxies were steadily changing over this time period."</p>
<p>Today, star-forming galaxies take the form of orderly disk-shaped systems, such as the Andromeda Galaxy or the Milky Way, where rotation dominates over other internal motions. The most distant blue galaxies in the study tend to be very different, exhibiting disorganized motions in multiple directions. There is a steady shift toward greater organization to the present time as the disorganized motions dissipate and rotation speeds increase. These galaxies are gradually settling into well-behaved disks.</p>
<p>"A good way to visualize what is happening is to imagine a crowd of ice skaters all getting together in a round rink at the same time," said coauthor David Koo, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. "At first, there would be a jumbling mix of skaters, but after awhile you are likely to see an orderly flow of skaters, all moving around smoothly in the same direction. This same evolution from early disorder to later order may well have been part of our home galaxy's life story."</p>
<p>The team studied a sample of 544 blue galaxies from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2) Redshift Survey, a project led by UC Santa Cruz astronomers Sandra Faber, Puragra Guhathakurta, and Koo, and UC Berkeley astronomer Marc Davis. Kassin worked on the survey as a postdoctoral researcher with Faber at UC Santa Cruz. Faber, now interim director of UC Observatories, led the development of the DEIMOS spectrograph at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, which was a crucial instrument for the survey.</p>
<p>Located between 2 billion and 8 billion light-years away, the galaxies in the sample have stellar masses ranging from about 0.3 percent to 100 percent of the mass of our home galaxy. The Milky Way galaxy must have gone through the same rough-and-tumble evolution as the galaxies in the DEEP2 sample, and gradually settled into its present state even as the sun and solar system were being formed.</p>
<p>A paper describing the new findings will be published October 20 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal.</em> "This is the first analysis ever that shows the dynamics of disk galaxies gradually settling down from early chaotic motions to orderly circular rotation over time. It is a truly novel result," Faber said.</p>
<p>Blue galaxies--their color indicates stars are forming within them--show less disorganized motions and ever-faster rotation speeds the closer they are observed to the present. This trend holds true for galaxies of all masses, but the most massive systems always show the highest level of organization. Researchers say the distant blue galaxies they studied are gradually transforming into rotating disk galaxies like our own Milky Way.</p>
<p>"Previous studies removed galaxies that did not look like the well-ordered rotating disks now common in the universe today," said coauthor Benjamin Weiner, an astronomer at the University of Arizona in Tucson who also did postdoctoral work at UC Santa Cruz on the DEEP project. "By neglecting them, these studies examined only those rare galaxies in the distant universe that are well-behaved and concluded that galaxies didn't change."</p>
<p>Rather than limit their sample to certain galaxy types, the researchers instead looked at all galaxies with emission lines bright enough to be used for determining internal motions. Emission lines indicate the discrete wavelengths of radiation characteristically emitted by the gas within a the galaxy. They are revealed when a galaxy's light is separated into its component colors. These emission lines also carry information about the galaxy's internal motions and distance.</p>
<p>In the past 8 billion years, the number of mergers between galaxies large and small has decreased sharply. So has the overall rate of star formation and disruptions of supernova explosions associated with star formation. Scientists speculate these factors may play a role in creating the evolutionary trend they observe.</p>
<p>Now that astronomers see this pattern, they can adjust computer simulations of galaxy evolution until these models are able to replicate the observed trend. This will guide scientists to the physical processes most responsible for it.</p>
<p>The DEEP2 survey is part of the DEEP Project, jointly led by astronomers at the University of California Observatories, headquartered at UC Santa Cruz, and in the Department of Astronomy at UC Berkeley. The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., manages the telescope. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Md., conducts Hubble science operations. STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. in Washington.</p>

<p>In coverage of several new studies on the origin of the moon, reporters turned to planetary scientist Erik Asphaug as an outside expert; he was interviewed on <strong>NPR's "<a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/segment/10/19/2012/scientists-in-the-dark-over-birth-of-the-moon.html">Science Friday</a>"</strong> and quoted in stories from the <strong><em><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-moon-history-20121018,0,316262.story">Los Angeles Times</a></em></strong> and <strong>Scientific American</strong>.</p>

<p>Asphaug's own research on the origin of the Saturn system prompted stories in <strong><em><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/moon-merge-model-could-explain-saturnian-system-1.11611">Nature</a>, <a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/santacruz/ci_21797686">Santa Cruz Sentinel</a>,</em></strong> <strong>UPI, Huffington Post, Yahoo News, TG Daily, LiveScience, IEEE Spectrum, PhysOrg,</strong> and <strong>RedOrbit</strong>.</p>

<p>Earth scientists Paul Koch and Sora Kim were featured in a <strong><em><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Great-whites-diets-shown-to-vary-widely-3954658.php">San Francisco Chronicle</a></em></strong> story about their research on the diets of great white sharks.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em></strong> covered the Practical Activism conference at Colleges Nine and Ten where professor emerita Angela Davis was the keynote speaker.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Sentinel</em></strong> also wrote about the Food What?! program that is part of Life Lab at the UCSC Farm and quoted a UCSC graduate and student who are involed with the program.</p>

<br/>
"Rethinking Development in Light of Climate Change," will take place from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Oakes College on the UCSC campus.<br/>
<br/>
Industrialization over the past 200 years has been critical for economic growth in developing countries but now there is increasing concern over its adverse environmental impacts. Municipal officials and academics from a variety of disciplines will address issues of how to improve rural and impoverished societies while not exacerbating climate change.<br/>
<br/>
A morning panel chaired by Adam Millard-Ball, UCSC assistant professor of environmental studies, will address "Localized Urban Development: Learning from Experience." Also participating will be Ross Clark, the city of Santa Cruz's climate action coordinator, and Lacey Raak, UCSC's climate action manager.<br/>
<br/>
Millard-Ball is a former transportation planner whose research looks at transportation, energy, and climate change policy. His current work examines the effectiveness of local climate planning efforts and the design of carbon trading programs,<br/>
<br/>
Morning and afternoon keynote addresses are scheduled at 9:15 a.m. with Hallie Eakin, associate professor at Arizona State University's Global Institute of Sustainability, and at 1:30 p.m. with Ashwini Chhatre, assistant professor in the Department of Geography at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<br/>
<br/>
Eakin's research explores how rural populations are vulnerable to the effects of environmental change and the global economy. She is currently looking at how coffee farmers adapt to changing conditions in Mexico and Central America.<br/>
<br/>
Chhatre's research focuses on the intersection of democracy with environment and development, with a recent emphasis on climate change vulnerability and adaptation.<br/>
<br/>
Other panels include "Industrialization in the Context of Climate Change" and "Sustaining Development or Building Equity?: Compensating the Vulnerable Poor for Climate Change."<br/>
<br/>

<p>Their company, which has signed a license agreement with UCSC, offers software and services for cancer researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and health-care organizations. Its goal is to provide the data processing and analysis required for personalized cancer therapy, in which treatments are matched to the specific genetic aberrations found in an individual patient's cancer cells.</p>
<p>"We're working with academic collaborators to build out the platform and starting conversations with pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies," said CEO Steve Benz, who completed his Ph.D. in bioinformatics this year. "It's a great opportunity to be able to take this technology and commercialize it so that it can be used to help patients."</p>
<p>In addition to Benz, the cofounders of Five3 Genomics include chief technical officer Zachary Sanborn and chief scientific officer Charles Vaske. All three of them worked as graduate students with UC Santa Cruz bioinformatics experts David Haussler and Joshua Stuart, who are doing pioneering work in the field of cancer genomics. Haussler, a professor of biomolecular engineering and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, said that Benz, Sanborn, and Vaske were "brilliant grad students."</p>
<p>"Working at UCSC they were exposed to the cutting edge in computational genomics," Haussler said. "They played a key role in developing our cancer genomics program. They are pure self-starters, and developed the code to implement their ideas from the bottom up. The algorithms they developed represented new breakthroughs in our ability to interpret DNA sequence information obtained from cancer tumors. This area is poised to move from the academic realm into the clinical realm in the next few years. By spinning off a start-up company, they have put themselves in an excellent position to play a key role in this transformation."</p>
<p>Vaske, who earned his Ph.D. in 2009, and Benz were lead developers of a software program from Stuart's lab called Paradigm. Stuart, a professor of biomolecular engineering, has been a close collaborator with Haussler on cancer genomics projects, including <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/10/3250.html">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a> (TCGA) funded by the National Institutes of Health and two cancer research "<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/10/prostate-cancer.html">Dream Teams</a>" funded by Stand Up To Cancer and other organizations.</p>
<p>Paradigm, one of the core technologies for Five3 Genomics, is used to understand which molecular pathways are affected by the genetic changes in a patient's cancer cells. This information can be used in a clinical setting to guide therapeutic decisions and by pharmaceutical companies to identify new targets for drug development.</p>
<p>"On the pharmaceutical side, we can provide indications for new uses for drugs that are already out there, as well as identify targets for new drugs," Benz said.</p>
<p>Sanborn, who will finish his Ph.D. this year, worked in Haussler's lab on a DNA sequence analysis program called BamBam, which is used to identify the genetic changes in cancer cells. Sanborn and Benz also contributed to the development of the UCSC <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/03/2802.html">Cancer Genome Browser</a> in Haussler's lab.</p>
<p>The scientific advisors for Five3 Genomics include Haussler and Stuart, as well as Patrick Soon-Shiong, M.D., a surgeon, medical researcher, and biotechnology entrepreneur, and Margaret Tempero, M.D., deputy director and director of research programs at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>
<p>"It's particularly gratifying to see this UCSC research transition to a commercial product, so these cutting-edge techniques can begin to benefit the public as quickly as possible," said Bruce Margon, vice chancellor for research at UCSC.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/10/images/five3-team-295.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/10/images/five3-team-295.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>five3-team-295.jpg</name><display-name>five3-team-295.jpg</display-name><file-size>16388</file-size><width>295</width><height>120</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Five3 Genomics</thumb-alt><title>Five3 Genomics</title><description>UCSC grad students launch cancer genomics company in Santa Cruz to offer genomics software and services for personalized cancer therapy.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="991bee84807270460171f989229769ee"><name>crime-bulletin-cctheft</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Crime Bulletin</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is seeking the public's assistance with the identification of the following person of interest.</summary><start-date>1351065600000</start-date><display-name>Community Crime Bulletin</display-name><path>/2012/10/crime-bulletin-cctheft</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/10/crime-bulletin-cctheft</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1351188475401</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1351188710105</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-western">

The&#160;decisions made on Tuesday, November 6, will be of great importance for all&#160;America, with the presidency and control of Congress on the line. But here in&#160;California, the election also could prove&#160;pivotal to the University of&#160;California and its immediate future.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>I refer to Proposition 30, one of&#160;11 statewide initiatives on the California ballot. This initiative, advanced by&#160;Governor Brown, would increase income and sales taxes on a temporary basis and&#160;thus avoid an assortment of prospective &#8220;trigger cuts&#8221; that were written into&#160;the current State budget, pending the election outcome.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>As you probably recall, The Regents&#160;last summer took the extraordinary step of endorsing Proposition 30, noting&#160;that should it fail our budget will be reduced by $250 million. In addition,&#160;$125&#160;million currently in the budget to ensure no increases in tuition through&#160;fiscal year 2012-13 will be forfeited.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Sadly, it&#8217;s not news that public&#160;higher education in California has been battered by declining State support.&#160;With an additional blow of this magnitude, The Regents&#8217; resolution stated, &#8220;the&#160;ability of the University of California to ensure the high-quality education&#160;that Californians have come to expect will be jeopardized....&#8221;</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Let me be clear that it is neither&#160;my official place, nor my personal predilection, to suggest how others should&#160;vote. You need to look at the facts and make your own informed decisions. In&#160;that&#160;vein, please allow me to point you to a good starting place:</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span>The above link will take you to a&#160;variety of Proposition 30 informational and campaign materials from sources on&#160;all sides of the ballot issue. This includes material from those who oppose the&#160;measure, arguing that it will increase taxes unnecessarily and burden small&#160;businesses.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>I also want to take this&#160;opportunity to invite all UC faculty and staff to a &#8220;web-chat&#8221; on Friday,&#160;November 2, from noon to 1 p.m. During that hour, I&#8217;ll be happy to take any&#160;questions on&#160;matters that concern the University, including those that relate&#160;to the coming election. The following link provides details about how to join&#160;in:</span></div>

<p>This year's Switzer Fellows, 20 in all, were chosen from universities in California and New England. Fellows are awarded $15,000 each to complete master's and doctoral degrees to advance their skills and develop their expertise to address critical environmental challenges.</p>
<p>Ganguli is studying mercury contamination in coastal groundwater and the ocean. She is also interested in terrestrial watershed dynamics and has been involved in several mine-site remediation projects in the California Coast Ranges. For her master's degree research at UCSC, she studied mercury transport and cycling at the abandoned New Idria Mercury Mine, which is now an EPA superfund site. After completing her M.S., Ganguli worked as a geologist at the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, where she worked on large-scale mine-site and wetland remediation projects. She also gained experience in environmental regulatory permitting at a number of industrial sites, including chemical plants, refineries, tank facilities, and landfills. Ganguli said she would like to combine her background in science and policy to continue working on multidisciplinary environmental restoration projects.</p>
<p>For her Ph.D. research, Ganguli is investigating mercury transformations at the land-sea margin, with a focus on quantifying the form and mass of mercury discharged to the ocean via coastal groundwater. She is also exploring the interaction between barrier beach lagoon surface water and coastal groundwater to determine how seasonal changes in water quality may influence nearshore mercury cycling. This research is adding to a growing body of literature documenting the importance of groundwater as a source of mercury to marine ecosystems. Ganguli is co-supervised by Andrew Fisher, professor of Earth and planetary sciences; Russell Flegal, professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology; and Peter Swarzenski, an oceanographer with the U.S. Geological Survey.</p>

<p>The image echoes one of the most famous images in the history of medical science: Wilhelm Roentgen's 1895 x-ray image of his wife's hand titled "Hand mit Ringen" ("hand with ring"). Nowadays, experimenting on one's spouse is frowned upon, so the proton imaging team used a radiographic hand phantom (an anatomical model of a hand with the same radiographic properties). They imaged it with protons from the medical proton synchrotron at Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC).</p>
<p>"This first image demonstrates the new promise of proton imaging, which is now within reach of becoming a new, potentially low-dose medical imaging modality," said Hartmut Sadrozinski, a research physicist at the <a href="http://scipp.ucsc.edu">Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics</a> (SCIPP) at UC Santa Cruz. "Our ultimate goal is to do proton computed tomography and reconstruct the images in three dimensions, like an x-ray CT scan."</p>
<p>The interdisciplinary team working on this project includes physicists and students at UC Santa Cruz, medical researchers and doctors at Loma Linda University, and computer scientists at California State University, San Bernardino. They presented their findings at the <a href="http://www.nss-mic.org/2012/NSSMain.asp">2012 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference</a> in Anaheim in a poster presentation on October 29 and in an invited talk by Dr. Reinhard Schulte from LLUMC, "A status update on proton imaging for applications in medicine," on October 30.</p>
<p>The proton imaging project is motivated by the increasing use of proton beams in cancer therapy. In proton therapy, powerful doses of radiation can be delivered directly to a tumor with little damage to surrounding healthy tissue. To do this, an image of the proton "stopping power" of the tissues is needed to guide the cancer treatment planning. This is achieved today by essentially translating x-ray images into proton stopping-power images, which compromises the accuracy of the images for proton treatment planning.</p>
<p>"The goal of our research is to generate these proton CT images directly, allowing more precise treatment planning," Sadrozinski said.</p>
<p>Like Roentgen's x-ray image, the proton image of the hand phantom clearly shows details of the bone structure. Unlike x-rays, however, protons also show the soft tissue of the hand in more detail, which reflects differences in how the two forms of radiation interact with tissues. Whereas x-rays get absorbed preferentially by bones and show them much more clearly than the surrounding soft tissue, protons get slowed down or stopped by bone only 50 percent more than by soft tissue.</p>
<p>In addition to the progress in image reconstruction reported at the meeting, the researchers are developing innovations in detector technology that they will incorporate into future prototypes of the proton CT scanner.</p>
<p>The work was performed by UCSC graduate student Tia Plautz, undergraduate students Celeste Leary, Andrew Plumb, and David Steinberg, and LLUMC researcher Robert F. Hurley (a graduate of the UCSC Physics Department). Grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation fund the work at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics, Loma Linda University and California State University San Bernardino. The researchers used mathematical algorithms and computer software developed in part by researchers at LLUMC, the University of Haifa (Israel), the University of Wollongong (Australia), and Stanford University (U.S.). The proton imaging detectors were built at UC Santa Cruz and Northern Illinois University with support from the Department of Defense and the Department of Radiation Medicine at LLUMC.</p>
<p>This research in proton CT is supported by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (award number R01EB013118), the U.S. Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program (award number W81XWH-12-1-0122), and the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (award number 2009012).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ad92a6a58072704600c4f42ce09f55c4"><name>galloway-video</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Budget news and the Nov. 6 election</title><summary>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway has prepared a web-based message about the campus budget and the Nov. 6 election.</summary><keywords>galloway, election, budget, video</keywords><start-date>1351497600000</start-date><display-name>Galloway-video</display-name><path>/2012/10/galloway-video</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/10/galloway-video</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1351531800147</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1351617447812</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I have prepared a brief web-based message about the campus budget and the importance of your vote on November 6.

<p>On behalf of the University and the City of Santa Cruz, I encourage you to avoid downtown Santa Cruz on Halloween night and instead choose to be on campus in order to participate in one or more of the many programs offered throughout our college and residential communities. &#160;Please see ( <a href="http://studentservices.ucsc.edu/calendar-events/halloween-2012.html">http://studentservices.ucsc.edu/calendar-events/halloween-2012.html</a> ) for a listing of programs being hosted on campus.&#160; In past years on Halloween, the downtown has been marred by incidents of violence, including stabbings. &#160;The City of Santa Cruz has been very clear that there is a zero tolerance policy regarding those that would disrupt the safety of the community out of concern for community members who may unintentionally become victims of violence.</p>
<p>Like the City of Santa Cruz, UCSC&#8217;s Police Department also enforces a zero tolerance policy as regards disruptive and/or dangerous behavior.&#160; Please be mindful and respectful of all campus policies, rules, and regulations.</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to report any suspicious activity or behavior by dialing 911 (on campus you may also dial 831/459-2231).</p>
<p>If, however, you do choose to go downtown, please be advised:</p>
<ul>
<li>UCSC will operate Night Owl buses on an augmented schedule departing from downtown Santa Cruz approximately every 25 minutes from 11:30pm until 2:15am Halloween Night.</li>
<li>Bus service from the downtown area may be limited and you may find yourself walking back up to campus. Should you have to walk back to campus, please remember to be good neighbors (i.e., respect the city noise ordinance, traffic laws and the property of others). &#160;Try to walk home with others as it can be very dark along several sections of the route back to campus.</li>
<li>Be advised that the downtown area has been designated a &#8220;triple fine&#8221; area for violations of city ordinances beginning on Monday, October 29<sup>th</sup> and extending through the early hours of Thursday, November 1<sup>st</sup>. &#160;Should you be involved in any incident for which you are cited by the City of Santa Cruz Police, you will also be referred to Student Judicial Affairs for possible University judicial action.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, the City of Santa Cruz Police Department has asked the University to share the following with UCSC students:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>If you are planning to come to downtown Santa Cruz on Halloween night, we ask that you have fun and behave responsibly. With the well-being of our residents and visitors in mind, the City has concentrated resources downtown to promote a safe environment that everyone can enjoy. This includes over 100 law enforcement officers from 9 agencies patrolling the downtown corridor and triple fines for certain violations of the Municipal Code. Triple fines and court costs make an alcoholic open container violation total $480, and littering almost $300.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>For your reference, information regarding the triple fine zone in the City of Santa Cruz is available at: <a href="http://studentservices.ucsc.edu/calendar-events/halloween-triple-fine-2012.pdf">http://studentservices.ucsc.edu/calendar-events/halloween-triple-fine-2012.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>I hope that you have a fun and safe time this Halloween.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Students</audience><admin>Sue Matthews, AVC Colleges, Housing and Educational Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ae7c40078072704600c4f42cc1b6aede"><name>open-enrollment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Open Enrollment 2013</title><summary>It’s time once again to review your UC benefits and make any changes.</summary><start-date>1351497600000</start-date><display-name>Open Enrollment 2013</display-name><path>/2012/10/open-enrollment</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/10/open-enrollment</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1351547109316</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1351548316229</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>It&#8217;s time once again to review your UC benefits and make any changes.&#160; UC&#8217;s annual Open Enrollment period begins today (Monday, Oct. 29) and ends at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 20.&#160; This is the time of year to review your health and welfare benefits, decide whether to make any changes, and enroll/re-enroll in a flexible spending account.</span></p>
<p><span>With the exception of those enrolled in the full Health Net HMO and Anthem Blue Cross PPO plans, most faculty and staff will see modest premium increases.&#160; UC continues to cover an average of 87 percent of premium costs. See the complete list of 2013 health care rates on At Your Service (<a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/health_welfare/medical/medical-plan-costs-2013.html">http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/health_welfare/medical/medical-plan-costs-2013.html</a>). &#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the efforts of our campus leadership and our colleagues at the Office of the President, there is no change in contracted medical groups for Health Net Blue &amp; Gold in Santa Cruz County.&#160; If you&#8217;re in the Health Net HMO or Anthem Blue Cross PPO, you may want to consider either Health Net Blue &amp; Gold or the Anthem Lumenos PPO with HRA.&#160; Both have substantially lower premiums with benefits similar to the Health Net HMO and Anthem Blue Cross PPO. &#160;You&#8217;ll find information comparing these plans in your Open Enrollment booklet.</span></p>
<p><span>There are several changes this year worth noting:<br/>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> For the HMO medical plans and the Anthem Blue Cross PLUS plans, some copayments for services will increase beginning Jan. 1, 2013.&#160; For example, doctor visits will cost $5 more and emergency room visits are increasing by $25.&#160; UC last increased copayments in 2006, and since then the full cost of doctor visits has increased about $50.</li>
<li><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Copayments for brand name and non-formulary prescription drugs are also increasing by $5 for all plans that charge a copay. &#160;Generic prescription drug copayments are not changing.</li>
<li><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Women&#8217;s preventive services will be offered at no charge in 2013.&#160; These include well-woman visits, FDA-approved contraception methods and counseling, breastfeeding support and supplies and more.</li>
<li><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> There will be changes to the Health Net Blue &amp; Gold network outside of Santa Cruz County.&#160; If your doctor or medical group is outside of Santa Cruz County, check the Health Net doctor directory to see if your doctor or medical group has joined or left the network.</li>
<li><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> The ARAG Legal Plan is open for enrollment this year.</li>
<li><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> The maximum amount you can contribute to the Health FSA is reduced to $2,500.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Please take time to review your 2013 options and choose the medical plan that best fits your needs.&#160; You should have received your Open Enrollment booklet at your home address last week.&#160; There are also tools on the Open Enrollment website (<a href="http://www.atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment">http://www.atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment</a>) to help you compare plans and find the one that&#8217;s right for you and your family.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have questions or need assistance with your enrollment decisions, consider attending an Open Enrollment presentation.&#160; Schedules may be found on the UCSC Open Enrollment website (<span><a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/ben_news/oe_2013.html">http://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/ben_news/oe_2013.html</a></span>).&#160; For individual assistance, please contact the Benefits Office at (831) 459-2013.&#160;</span> <span>&#160;</span></p>

<p><span>Re:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Apertura de Inscripci&#243;n 2013</span></p>
<p><span>Otra vez ha llegado el tiempo de revisar sus planes de beneficios y la oportunidad de hacer cambios si desea. La Apertura de Inscripci&#243;n (Open Enrollment)</span> comienza hoy (el lunes, 29 de octubre) y termina a las 5:00 p.m. el martes, 20 de noviembre. Este es el tiempo del a&#241;o para revisar sus beneficios de salud y bienestar, decidir si hacer cambios e inscribirse/re-inscribirse en una cuenta de gastos flexible (FSA o DepCare).</p>
<p><span>Con excepci&#243;n de los que</span> est&#225;n inscritos en los planes de Health Net HMO y Anthem Blue Cross PPO la mayor&#237;a del cuerpo acad&#233;mico y otros empleados ver&#225;n aumentos de prima modestos. UC sigue cubriendo un promedio de 87 por ciento de los costos de la prima. Para ver la lista completa de primas de los planes de la salud para 2013 vaya al sitio Web &#8220;At Your Service&#8221; (<a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment/employees/e-espanol-plan-rates.html">http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment/employees/e-espanol-plan-rates.html</a>).</p>
<p><span>A pesar de los esfuerzos de nuestro liderazgo de campus y nuestros colegas en la Oficina del Presidente, no hay ning&#250;n cambio en grupos m&#233;dicos contratados con el plan de Health Net Azul y Oro en el Condado de Santa Cruz. Si est&#225;s en el Health Net HMO o Anthem Blue Cross PPO</span> quiz&#225;s desee considerar los planes de Health Net Azul y Oro o el Anthem Blue Cross Lumenos con HRA. Ambos tienen primas sustancialmente m&#225;s bajas con beneficios similares a Health Net HMO y Anthem Blue Cross PPO. Encontrar&#225; informaci&#243;n comparando estos planes en su folleto de Apertura de Inscripci&#243;n (Open Enrollment Booklet).</p>
<p><span>Hay varios cambios este a&#241;o que merecen atenci&#243;n:<br/>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Para los planes m&#233;dicos HMO y el Anthem Blue Cross PLUS, algunos copagos por servicios aumentar&#225;n a partir del 1&#186; de enero del 2013. Por ejemplo, las visitas al doctor costar&#225;n $5 m&#225;s y las visitas a una sala de emergencias aumentar&#225;n $25 m&#225;s. La &#250;ltima vez que la UC aument&#243; los copagos fue en el 2006 y desde entonces el costo completo de las visitas al doctor han aumentado unos $50.</li>
<li><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Los copagos por f&#225;rmacos recetados con nombre de marca o fuera del formulario tambi&#233;n aumentar&#225;n $5 m&#225;s en todos los planes que cobren copagos. Los copagos por f&#225;rmacos recetados gen&#233;ricos no cambiar&#225;n.</li>
<li><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Los servicios preventivos femeninos se ofrecer&#225;n libres de cargo en el 2013. Estos incluyen las visitas &#8220;well-woman&#8221;, los m&#233;todos anticonceptivos y asesoramiento aprobados por la FDA, y apoyo y suministros para la lactancia y m&#225;s.</li>
<li><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Habr&#225; cambios a la red de Health Net Azul y Oro afuera del Condado de Santa Cruz. Si su m&#233;dico o grupo m&#233;dico esta afuera del Condado de Santa Cruz, compruebe el directorio m&#233;dico Health Net para ver si su m&#233;dico o grupo m&#233;dico ha unido o abandonado la red.</li>
<li><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> El Plan Legal ARAG estar&#225; abierto para inscripci&#243;n este a&#241;o.</li>
<li><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Como en a&#241;os anteriores este es el momento para inscr&#237;base o reinscr&#237;base en el FSA de salud o FSA DepCare; tenga en cuenta que cantidad m&#225;xima que se puede contribuir a la FSA de salud se redujo a $2.500 este a&#241;o.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Por favor aparte tiempo para repasar sus opciones para 2013, y escoja el plan m&#233;dico que mejor responda a sus necesidades.</span> Usted debe haber recibido su folleto de Apertura de Inscripci&#243;n en tu domicilio la semana pasada.

<br/>
Pollan, long interested in UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), said he accepted the invitation to join the panel because it gave him an opportunity for his first visit to UCSC and the Farm. Pollan is best known for writing on food and food politics, including the best-selling Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma.<br/>
<br/>
He heard firsthand about the CASFS apprenticeship program that trains new organic farmers and gardeners, and other activities based at UCSC's farm and garden sites. Representatives from CASFS, the Life Lab garden education program, and UCSC&#8217;s Food Systems Working Group hosted a luncheon prepared by staff and high school students from Life Lab&#8217;s &#8220;Food What!?&#8221; youth empowerment program.<br/>
<br/>
Joining Pollan were other panel members, including Randall Grahm, founder of Bonny Doon Vineyards, Jamie Smith, Food Service director at Santa Cruz City Schools, and Darrie Ganzhorn, executive director of the Homeless Garden Project.<br/>
<br/>
Guests learned about the many projects taking place both on and off campus aimed at improving farmworker conditions, nutrition and science education, campus food system sustainability, and school food programs.<br/>
<br/>
After lunch, the group toured the farm with CASFS executive director Daniel Press and heard from CASFS staff members Liz Milazzo and Christof Bernau about the ecological horticulture program, which has trained more than 1,400 apprentices in the skills and knowledge of organic farming and gardening, as well as social issues associated with developing a sustainable food system.<br/>
<br/>
CASFS also hosts research on organic farming techniques, including a USDA-funded project to find alternatives to methyl bromide fumigation for strawberry production, as well as classes and internships for UCSC students, and an annual series of community gardening workshops.<br/>

The fall offerings consist of:</p>
<p><strong>Program A &#8212; November 1, 3, and 9:<br/>
</strong>&#8226; This year&#8217;s African-American production is&#160;<em>The Colored Museum.</em> Written by George C. Wolfe, this play is a marvelously satirical look at the stereotypes, tropes, and historical figures of African&#160;American history. The play deconstructs aspects of the African American experience and the "cultural madness" of the community.</p>
<p>&#8226; The Asian-American production is&#160;<em>Down and Out,</em> a play written by Melinda Foley centered on a dysfunctional family living in Virginia. The play deals with the life of a family that has been ripped&#160;apart by a runaway mother, the death of a father, and a sister who has gone missing.</p>
<p><strong>Program B &#8212; November 2, 4, and 10:</strong><br/>
&#8226; The Chicano-Latino production for this year is the critically acclaimed <em>Real Women Have Curves</em> by Josefina Lopez. The play depicts the story of five women working in a small sewing factory in&#160;East Los Angeles in the summer of 1987. Through the conversations of these lively characters, the play provides an inside perspective on the struggles and lives of Latina women, who experience&#160;issues with body image, low wages, and the ever-present fear of deportation.</p>
<p>&#8226; Poet&#8217;s Corner, a performance poetry show written by 14 members of Rainbow Theater invoking themes of love, community, and social justice.</p>
<p>For the first time this year, the Rainbow Theater Dance Troupe will be showcasing a variety of dance performances as a part of program B.</p>
<p><strong>5th Element &#8212; November 16, 17, and 18:<br/>
</strong>&#8226; The Fifth Element is an ethnic play that changes themes and content annually. Instead of being inherently based upon the lives of one ethnic group, the Fifth Element picks a multicultural play&#160;that tells the story of ethnic groups not represented by the four other productions. This year's production is <em>Breath Boom,</em> written by Kia Corthon, which deals with issues of identity, suicide, rape,&#160;AIDS, the prison industrial complex, and gang culture.</p>
<p>All shows are held at the Stevenson center; doors open at 6:30 and the shows start at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Admission to all shows is free to UCSC students with ID; $7 for non-UCSC students with ID and for seniors; and $10 for everyone else.</p>
<p>"It is through these productions, our academic courses, and a multitude of year-round events that we support students from all&#160;cultures, backgrounds, ethnicities, and talents," says Don Williams, the longtime artistic director of Rainbow Theater. "We would like to sincerely thank the many faculty and staff members for the tremendous amounts of support, hard work, and dedication that continuously go into maintaining our programming."</p>

<br/>
The grant comes from the Claire Giannini Fund founded in 1998 after the death of Claire Giannini Hoffman, daughter of A.P. Giannini, founder of the Bank of America.<br/>
<br/>
Funding has provided for extended hours over the summer, hours that will continue through the current academic year and summer 2013. The longer hours makes it much easier for students to take early or late classes, said Dave Keller, UCSC director of housing and facility services.<br/>
<br/>
The observation room at the UCSC Child Study Center means that undergraduate and graduate students in advanced infant development classes can observe the behavior of young children more easily. Previously, the university didn't have a facility to observe children's behavior in a research setting.<br/>
<br/>
"A great university should have a great child and family center," said Catherine Cooper, quoting her father. Cooper, emerita professor of psychology at UCSC, was instrumental in securing the grant and establishing the observation site. The facility is an opportunity to integrate research, teaching, and service at UCSC, she said.<br/>
<br/>
It is the first step toward an ultimate goal of providing childcare for faculty, staff and students and a rich child development/family study center.<br/>
<br/>
The Giannini Fund's three trustees visited the center earlier this month. Trustee Betsy Buchalter Adler, a Cowell alumna, and trustee on the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, said she asked childcare officials what were the top five things Early Education Services needed. Numbers one and two were extended hours, she was told, and three was to equip a room for child observation.<br/>
<br/>
Adler, who has retired as senior counsel at her firm Adler &amp; Colvin in San Francisco, specializes in advising non-profits. Her practice focuses on grant-making charities, including family, company, and community foundations; charitable governance issues; and international philanthropy.<br/>
<br/>
She said she and the Giannini Fund's two other trustees are focusing on programs that serve children under 18 and on early intervention programs for youths with vision or hearing impairments.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d32490e68072704613e9e1fe84c67e22"><name>rev-fall-12-alumni-notes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Notes </title><start-date>1352106000000</start-date><display-name>Alumni Notes</display-name><path>/2012/10/rev-fall-12-alumni-notes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/10/rev-fall-12-alumni-notes</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1352162119820</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1352162119820</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>To get alumni news delivered to your inbox, subscribe to the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/newsletter">UCSC e-newsletter</a>.</p>
