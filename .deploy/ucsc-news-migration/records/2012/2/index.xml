Hanson passed away on January 25.</p>
<hr/>
<p>We are saddened to learn of the death on January 25 of Hardy Hanson, professor emeritus of art. Hardy taught visual art at UCSC for many years and continued to create drawings, paintings and intaglio prints and show his artwork in a variety of galleries after he retired from the Art Department in 1994. He will be remembered for his sensitive teaching style, his intensive drawing classes, and his intricate explorations of color, line, and space.&#160;</p>
<p>Hardy and his family moved to Santa Cruz in 1969. He joined the arts faculty that year, appointed by the department's first chairman, Gurdon Woods. Woods led the hiring process for Hanson's colleagues in those early days of the Art Department; colleagues included Patrick Ahearne, Don Weygandt, and Doyle Foreman.</p>
<p>Born on February 16, 1935, Hanson took his Bachelor of Fine Arts at Yale University, and taught at University of Southern California, and at California State University, Northridge before his appointment to UCSC. During the early 1970s, Professor Hanson was one of 23 UC faculty appointed to the University's Creative Arts Institute, designed to provide opportunities for sustained creative efforts. A lifelong painter, printmaker and sculptor, Hanson operated his own handpress since his undergraduate days, and had designed, illustrated, printed and bound limited editions of poetry by Eric Baker, Estelle Kurzen, and Douglas Clayton, as well as portfolios of his own drawings.</p>
<p>Always passionate about the foundational skills of drawing and painting, which were central not only into his output of intricate, multiple-stage color etchings, but remained at the heart of his teaching philosophy, Hanson has been recalled fondly by his many students over the years. Betsy Miller Anderson, director of the Museo Eduardo Carrillo, remembers Hardy as one of her favorite teachers from her UCSC experience. Book artist Felicia Rice paid tribute to Hanson in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote>Hardy Hanson was one of the three sponsors for my independent major and helped me get my first letterpress printing job in Santa Cruz (announcements for an art gallery on Cedar St.). His knowledge and appreciation of type and typography were rare on campus at the time. Without his support I might not have launched myself on my life's trajectory, certainly not in Santa Cruz. I look forward to attending his remembrance.</blockquote>
<p>"I regard him as a fabulous artist, I truly do," added sculptor Jack Zajac, Hanson's longtime colleague and fellow Art Department member. "We were there at UCSC together until I retired. There's no one working in his way, with his vision. The things that he put together, some of them simple and commonplace, became objects of extraordinary distinction in his hands." Acknowledging Hanson's rigorous dedication to developing students' skills, Zajac noted that Hanson "held the point of view that drawing was fundamental." Hardy Hanson's passing has touched all who knew and worked with him. "This is a huge loss," Jack Zajac admits. "We are having a terrible time absorbing it."</p>
<p>In the tradition of Professor Hanson&#8217;s work and philosophy and his artistic focus, a new fund has been created to support UCSC students, faculty and visiting artists whose work remains true to his spirit. Donations may be made to:</p>

<br/>
Meriwether chairs the Grateful Dead area of the conference, now celebrating its 15th year. <br/>
<br/>
Past presentations in Dead studies have represented more than 22 academic fields&#8212;including anthropology, archival science, history, literature, musicology, sociology, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meriwether is also the editor</strong> of <em>Dead Studies, Volume 2</em>, a new academic publication from the Grateful Dead Archive, building on more than four decades of scholarly work on the Grateful Dead and more than a decade of published work by conference scholars. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I believe it is perhaps the only peer-reviewed academic journal solely devoted to rock music in the country,&#8221; said Meriwether. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;In the past 15 years, conference members have given 269 papers, 97 of which have been revised for publication,&#8221; he added. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meriwether noted that the Grateful Dead</strong> section now makes up one of the largest areas of the conference on popular culture. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The scholarly work on the Dead phenomenon spans everything from business theory and strategy to social networking, and literary analysis&#8230;you name it,&#8221; said Meriwether. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The fact that we&#8217;re continuing to grow is indicative of the ever increasing interest in the Grateful Dead phenomenon.&#8221;&#160; <br/>
<br/>
In the past year alone, two high-profile books have been published on the Dead&#8217;s marketing acumen and business prowess--<em>Everything I Know About Business I Learned from the Grateful Dead</em> by Barry Barnes, and <em>Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead</em> by Boston writers David Meerman Scott and Brian Halligan.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>But Meriwether said that the groundswell</strong> is not only in business circles, but also in the band&#8217;s popularity with the public, citing a new book by Paul Grushkin published in October titled <em>Dead Letters: The Very Best Grateful Dead Fan Mail</em>.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Paul Grushkin&#8217;s book drew heavily from materials in the Grateful Dead archive,&#8221; Meriwether noted, &#8220;and all of this complements the increasingly scholarly attention devoted to the Dead phenomenon as well.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Meriwether observed that his personal concept of an archive has changed in recent years&#8212;expanding from a primary focus on serving scholars to making an archive much more available to the public and community.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We&#8217;re really at the crest of a wave in Dead Studies," added Meriwether.&#160; "And it shows no sign of breaking or abating."<br/>

<p>During his remarks at the reception, UCSC associate chancellor Ashish Sahni called UCSC&#8217;s estimated 100 veteran students an essential part of the community fabric.&#160;</p>
<p>Many have served in Iraq, Afghanistan or the Gulf War. UCSC has become an essential stepping stone in these young veterans&#8217; lives as they transition from military service into civilian life.</p>
<p>"We are so proud of our veteran students and our veteran&#8217;s program," said Sahni, who called the veterans&#160; "highly motivated, with exceptionally high standards and aspirations. They bring a diverse and important viewpoint to the campus."</p>
<p>A dozen veterans were able to attend the reception. They spoke highly of UCSC&#8217;s veterans program, initiated and overseen by <a href="http://stars.ucsc.edu//">Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students</a> (STARS).</p>
<p>Veteran students receive priority housing and class enrollment at UCSC. They can also take advantage of the resources at the Veterans Education Team Support, a home base for vets that includes drop-in appointments, peer mentoring, academic advising, a newsletter and social events for UCSC's veterans. VETS is now entering its fourth year of serving UCSC students.</p>
In her remarks at the reception, STARS director Corinne Miller said much of the strength of UCSC&#8217;s vets program lies in its peer mentorship network. Veterans learn and work with each other throughout their time&#160;at UCSC and create a welcoming, familiar environment for new students. At VETS, veterans can swap military stories or help each other out as peer mentors. Staffers are available for drop-ins or appointments from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3a6e31c7807270460142203097bfb9c9"><name>shakespeare-season</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Shakespeare Santa Cruz announces lineup for 2012 season </title><summary>Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SSC) artistic director Marco Barricelli today announced the line-up for the acclaimed UCSC theater company’s 31st season--including the premiere of a new play commissioned by SSC. </summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, shakespeare santa cruz, theater arts, shakespeare festivals, california shakespeare festivals, theater, summer shakespeare festivals</keywords><start-date>1328127000000</start-date><display-name>Shakespeare Santa Cruz season </display-name><path>/2012/02/shakespeare-season</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/02/shakespeare-season</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1328125194597</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1328633653128</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Theater Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name> Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/glen_2012-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/glen_2012-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>glen_2012-350.jpg</name><display-name>glen_2012-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>52132</file-size><width>350</width><height>232</height></image><image-alt>Outdoor Festival Glen at UC Santa Cruz, home of Shakespeare Santa Cruz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/Shake-12thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/Shake-12thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Shake-12thumb.jpg</name><display-name>Shake-12thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>599824</file-size><width>81</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><strong>"The Man In the Iron Mask</strong>," a new play by Scott Wentworth, will have its world premiere at UCSC's Festival Glen (above).

<br/>
Running July 24 through August 26, the 2012 season will kick off with one of Shakespeare&#8217;s most popular and beloved comedies, <strong>Twelfth Nigh</strong>t, directed by Barricelli in the indoor Mainstage Theater.<br/>
<br/>
Opening in the Festival Glen will be the world premiere of <strong>The Man In the Iron Mask</strong>, a new play written by SSC associate artist Scott Wentworth, based on the works of Alexandre Dumas.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The Man In the Iron Mask</strong> was commissioned by SSC as the sequel to 2011&#8217;s highly successful production of <em>The Three Musketeers</em>.<br/>
<br/>
&#160;&#8220;I am proud to continue the SSC tradition of creating new work that other theatre companies will be able to add to their repertoire,&#8221; said Barricelli.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s another way in which SSC is both serving the local&#160; community, as well as leaving an imprint on the regional theatre world,&#8221; he added.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Playing in repertory</strong> in the Festival Glen will be the SSC debut of <strong>Henry IV, Part Two</strong>, directed by Scott Wentworth.&#160;</p>
<p>This continues the SSC cycle of history plays begun in 2011 with <em>Henry IV, Part One</em>. It concludes in 2013 with <em>Henry V.</em><br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled to be producing <strong>Henry IV, Part Two</strong> for the first time ever at SSC,&#8221; Barricelli noted.&#160; &#8220;I think this cycle provides the opportunity for audiences to engage on a deeper level, and come with us on a journey that lasts beyond just one evening or one summer.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>At the close of the summer season</strong>, SSC will transfer its production of <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> to Montalvo Arts Center in Saratoga, where it will play September 8 through 16 in the 1,200-seat, outdoor Lilian Fontaine Garden Theatre.<br/>

This continues a partnership with Montalvo Arts Center that SSC began last year, when <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> moved to Montalvo for an extended run.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It was exciting for us to bring the great work we&#8217;re doing in Santa Cruz to a new audience in Silicon Valley,&#8221; said SSC Managing Director Kyle Clausen.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The feedback we received from audience members was overwhelmingly in favor of continuing this partnership.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>UCSC Arts Division Dean David Yager</strong> has also announced a deepened commitment to SSC on the part of UC Santa Cruz.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We have just celebrated the successful 30-year anniversary of Shakespeare Santa Cruz, and the University has dramatically upgraded its long-term support for SSC, which I believe, demonstrates our shared commitment to the future of the program,&#8221; said Yager.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I am extremely excited about the upcoming season, and I look forward to new collaborations between SSC and the Theater Arts Department for the benefit of our students, faculty, and the community,&#8221; Yager added.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>A free public season preview</strong> event is set for Bookshop Santa Cruz on Tuesday, June 5, beginning at 7:30 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
SSC will announce its annual fall benefit performances and holiday co-production later this spring.<br/>

<br/>
In giving the book its "New Millennium Award," the society called <em>The Consequential Damages of Nuclear War &#8211; The Rongelap Report</em> (Left Coast Press, 2008)&#160; "the most significant and potentially influential contribution to medical anthropology."<br/>
<br/>
Written with Holly M. Barker, an anthropologist at the University of Washington, the book tracks the consequences of U.S. nuclear weapons testing in the Marshall Islands during the 1940s and 1950s. Johnston and Barker examine the experiences of the people who lived on Rongelap and other Marshallese atolls in the U.S. Pacific Proving Grounds, located about halfway between Hawaii and Australia.&#160; They investigate what it means to experience radioactive fallout as it moves through the marine and terrestrial environment, into the food chain, through the human body, and subsequent generations.<br/>
<br/>
The book includes a summation of evidence Johnston and Barker submitted to the Marshall Islands Nuclear Claims Tribunal that helped support a $1.34 billion judgment for the people of Rongelap for damages associated with environmental contamination, human radiation experimentation, and loss of a way life, an award that the U.S. has yet to pay. Consequential Damages of Nuclear War was nominated last year by a University of Arizona public health professor who saw the work to be especially relevant in the aftermath of the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan last April.<br/>
<br/>
Johnston is a public anthropologist whose science and human rights work has been sponsored by the Center for Political Ecology in Santa Cruz, and is frequent speaker at universities across the nation. At UCSC, she has lectured at College Eight, and in environmental studies and sociology, most recently in sociology in fall 2010 while also serving as a sociology research associate.<br/>

With an orbital period of about 28 days and a minimum mass 4.5 times that of the Earth, the planet orbits within the star's "habitable zone," where temperatures are neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water to exist on the planet's surface. The researchers found evidence of at least one and possibly two or three additional planets orbiting the star, which is about 22 light years from Earth.</p>
<p>The team includes UC Santa Cruz astronomers Steven Vogt and Eugenio Rivera and was led by Guillem Anglada-Escud&#233; and Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution for Science. Their work will be published by <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters,</em> and the manuscript will be posted online at <a href="http://arxiv.org/archive/astro-ph">arxiv.org/archive/astro-ph</a>.</p>
<p>The host star is a member of a triple-star system and has a different makeup than our sun, with a much lower abundance of elements heavier than helium, such as iron, carbon, and silicon. This discovery indicates that potentially habitable planets can occur in a greater variety of environments than previously believed.</p>
<p>The researchers used public data from the European Southern Observatory and analyzed it with a novel data-analysis method. They also incorporated new measurements from the W. M. Keck Observatory's High Resolution Echelle Spectrograph and the new Carnegie Planet Finder Spectrograph at the Magellan II Telescope. Their planet-finding technique involved measuring the small wobbles in a star's motion caused by the gravitational tug of a planet.</p>
<p>The host star, called GJ 667C, is an M-class dwarf star. The other two stars in the triple-star system (GJ 667AB) are a pair of orange K dwarfs, with a concentration of heavy elements only 25 percent that of our sun's. Such elements are the building blocks of terrestrial planets, so it was thought to be less likely for metal-depleted star systems to have an abundance of low-mass planets.</p>
<p>"This was expected to be a rather unlikely star to host planets. Yet there they are, around a very nearby, metal-poor example of the most common type of star in our galaxy," said Vogt, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC. "The detection of this planet, this nearby and this soon, implies that our galaxy must be teeming with billions of potentially habitable rocky planets."</p>
<p>GJ 667C had previously been observed to have a super-Earth (GJ 667Cb) with a period of 7.2 days, although this finding was never published. This planet orbits so close to the star that it would be too hot for liquid water. The new study started with the aim of obtaining the orbital parameters of this super-Earth.</p>
<p>But in addition to this first candidate, the research team found the clear signal of a new planet (GJ 667Cc) with an orbital period of 28.15 days and a minimum mass of 4.5 times that of Earth. The new planet receives 90 percent of the light that Earth receives. However, because most of its incoming light is in the infrared, a higher percentage of this incoming energy should be absorbed by the planet. When both these effects are taken into account, the planet is expected to absorb about the same amount of energy from its star that the Earth absorbs from the sun.</p>
<p>"This planet is the new best candidate to support liquid water and, perhaps, life as we know it," Anglada-Escud&#233; said.</p>
<p>The team found that the system might also contain a gas-giant planet and an additional super-Earth with an orbital period of 75 days. However, further observations are needed to confirm these two possibilities.</p>
<p>"With the advent of a new generation of instruments, researchers will be able to survey many M dwarf stars for similar planets and eventually look for spectroscopic signatures of life in one of these worlds," said Anglada-Escud&#233;, who was with Carnegie when he conducted the research, but has since moved on to the University of Gottingen.</p>

<p>With 61 alumni currently serving as Peace Corps volunteers, UC Santa Cruz ranks 24th among all large universities in the nation. &#160;Last year, UC Santa Cruz ranked sixth in the medium school category, but a slight increase in enrollment moved the school into the large schools grouping.&#160; So far, a total of 744 UC Santa Cruz alumni have served in the Peace Corps.</p>
<p>"Colleges and universities prepare thousands of talented undergraduate and graduate alumni for Peace Corps service every year," said Peace Corps Director Aaron S. Williams (Dominican Republic, 1967-1970). "These alumni go on to serve as Peace Corps volunteers, applying the skills and knowledge they acquired during their studies to promote world peace and friendship and improve the lives of people around the world.&#160; I would like to extend my gratitude to all colleges and universities for their continued support of the Peace Corps and public service."</p>
<p>Arielle Hostetler, who graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2010 with a degree in psychology, is one of the 61 alumni currently serving overseas.&#160; The Boulder Creek, Calif. native is teaching English in China and is scheduled to complete her two-year tour in the summer of 2013.&#160; Hostetler applied to the Peace Corps because she &#8220;wanted to do more traveling and immerse myself in a new culture.&#160; Peace Corps sounded like a great adventure to take after college and before law school.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Peace Corps&#8217; Top Colleges and Universities report ranks colleges and universities according to the size of the student body. Nationally, the University of Colorado at Boulder outpaced other universities with 112 undergraduate alumni currently serving overseas. Historically, UC Berkeley maintains the number one all-time rank, with 3,497 Peace Corps volunteer alumni.&#160; You may view all the rankings <a href="http://multimedia.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/pdf/stats/schools2012.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Giovanni's presentation, a blend of historical memory, poetry, performance art, personal anecdote, call-and-response demands for action, stream-of-consciousness observations and irreverent comedy routine, was largely unscripted.</p>
<p>But Giovanni pushed a consistent message about resisting bigotry and mob mentalities, emphasizing individual responsibility while building a sense of community. In a broadside of her poem on display outside the auditorium, Giovanni pledged to "always choose to be the person running rather than the mob chasing."</p>
<p>She spoke of carrying on the dream of Martin Luther King Jr. without losing the ability to laugh along the way. To make this point, she re-imagined King as a hip-hop artist wearing a tattoo that says "Freedom Life" and rapping out the words "we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check."</p>
<p><strong>Sitting with Rosa Parks</strong></p>
<p>Giovanni's sly humor was consistent, whether she was reciting an extremely brief poem called "Note to the South" (the entire poem reads, "You lost") or recalling the first time she met Rosa Parks, who was sitting in a waiting area at an airport. Giovanni brusquely asked a man sitting next to Parks to yield his seat so she could have a few moments with the civil rights pioneer. "That man didn't have a clue as to who he was sitting next to," Giovanni remarked. "I just walked over with an attitude and stood in front of him. I said, "You gonna move or what?"</p>
<p>As it turned out, Parks was familiar with Giovanni's poetry. The two became fast friends. Giovanni linked Parks's enormous impact on the civil rights movement to her personal humility and her circumstances; at the time of her arrest for refusing to yield her bus seat to a white customer in the segregated south, Parks was a 42-year-old seamstress who lived in the projects.</p>
<p>If she were younger and well off, and if she had any option other than riding the bus, the indignation would not have been so widespread, Giovanni said. The outcry came forth from the projects and the "juke joints," she said.</p>
<p>Giovanni said Parks's bravery, dignity, and grace&#8212;she famously told the police, "You may do so" when they threatened her with arrest&#8212;opened doors for other pioneers including Martin Luther King Jr. himself. But she also humanized her friend by recalling Parks's almost excessively polite manners; the first time Parks called Giovanni, she asked if the professor and poet were "too busy" to speak with her.</p>
<p><strong>Tracing the movement</strong></p>
<p>Giovanni reminded the crowd that King's reign as a Civil Rights leader was brief&#8212;he rose to prominence in his 20s and was cut down by an assassin's bullet when he was just 39. "Really, we only had him for 13 years," she said. But Giovanni placed King in the middle of a living movement that she traced back to Henry David Thoreau's civil disobedience and his night in jail in 1846&#8212;he was protesting the U.S. war on Mexico by refusing to pay taxes.</p>
<p>Then she traced the movement all the way up to the present day, when anti-immigration and anti-gay rhetoric have led to new fronts in the civil rights battle. Like Thoreau and King, she called for a strong sense of individual responsibility and community: "We're living in difficult times," she said. "And if we can't count on each other, what is the point of being a human being?"</p>
<p>Her closing poem was featured in the Smithsonian's traveling exhibit, "In the Spirit of Martin: The Living Legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr." The poem&#8212;like her remarks&#8212;was a sensory tour through black history, from Montgomery to Birmingham and Selma, from the "swirling Mississippi" to the "Tennessee dust," and concluding with the words:</p>
<p>This is a sacred poem&#8230;open your arms&#8230;turn your palms up&#8230;<br/>
feel the Spirit of Greatness&#8230;and be redeemed</p>
<p>Soon afterward, Santa Cruz Mayor Don Lane presented her with a key to the city "so you will come back again and use it," negating Giovanni's joking comments that she would "never be invited back again" because of her edgier comments.</p>
<p><strong>Tony Hill Award</strong></p>
<p>Also at the convocation, UCSC officials presented the fourth annual Tony Hill Award to Deutron Kebebew (Kresge '03, electrical engineering), who grew up as a foster child and became a passionate advocate for foster children throughout Santa Cruz County, encouraging their growth and development as well as their readiness for full-time careers and college educations.</p>
<p>Currently, Kebebew, who was born in Ethiopia and now resides in Watsonville, is project director for <a href="http://papassfi.org/">PAPAS</a>, a Santa Cruz County-based organization that supports fathers' active involvement with their families.</p>
<p>The Tony Hill Award committee cited Kebebew's commitment to mentorship, mediation, and bridge building&#8212;three values that guided the life of community activist Tony Hill, who died in 2007 at age 62.</p>
<p>Melanie Stern, Hill's widow, described Kebebew's integrity, passion, and ability to overcome obstacles. "He is relentless, a word I would also use to describe Tony."</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Kebebew turned 35 on the day of the ceremony&#8212;he briefly lost his composure when the crowd burst into "Happy birthday to you" before he made his remarks.</p>
<p>After blessing "the people in my life who invested their time, energy, and unconditional love," Kebebew turned his attention to those who don't have the kind of support system he received.</p>
<p><strong>Fatherless homes</strong></p>
<p>Citing some alarming statistics&#8212;for instance, one out of three American children live in fatherless homes&#8212;he asked the crowd to join him on his quest to address the "physical, mental, and emotional" absence of too many fathers from their children's lives.</p>
<p>Kebebew received $500 to donate to the charities of his choice. He chose the Smith Renaissance Society Scholarship Fund, CASA of Santa Cruz County, Watsonville Rotary Club Scholarship Fund, and PAPAS.</p>
<p>In his remarks, UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal urged the many middle and high school students in the audience to aim for college. "If your parents didn't go to college, what I say to you is, 'Don't worry. Mine didn't either!" Blumenthal noted that 44 percent of UCSC's freshman class would be the first in their families to earn a four-year college degree.</p>
<p>He then turned his attention to Martin Luther King Jr. "If he were alive today, my guess is he'd be leading the call for economic equality," said Blumenthal, urging audience members to make their voices heard. "Don't sell his memory short by sitting on the sidelines. Get involved."</p>
<p>The evening also included opening remarks by UCSC associate professor of history David Anthony and a dramatic performance by the African American Theater Arts troupe, a student-based organization.</p>

L. Hammack, assistant professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz, has been named recipient of the 2011 Early Career Award of the Society for the Study of Peace, Conflict, and Violence: Division of Peace Psychology, American Psychological Association (APA).<br/>
<br/>
The award is the second such honor for Hammack in the past year. Last fall, he was named recipient of the Louise Kidder Early Career Award from the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues of the APA.<br/>
<br/>
Hammack joined UCSC in 2007 and is the author of <em>Narrative and the Politics of Identity: The Cultural Psychology of Israeli and Palestinian Youth</em> (Oxford University Press, 2011).<br/>
<br/>
This academic year, Hammack is a National Academy of Education/Spencer Postdoctoral Fellow. He is writing another book, tentatively titled <em>Can Talking Help? Dialogue and the Politics of Difference</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Hammack said his new book picks up where the first one left off. "I ask what kind of dialogue we seek to foster among groups who view one another as fundamentally &#8220;different&#8221;&#8212;in the case of Israelis and Palestinians, so different that they engage in acts of mutual delegitimization and (at the extreme) violence."<br/>
<br/>
The early career award includes a $500 prize and will be presented at the APA annual convention in August held in Orlando, Fla.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="452ad5ec80727046014220307185a094"><name>sterry-180-days</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Community Studies alumna brings one-woman show to Santa Cruz</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz alumna Taren Sterry returns to Santa Cruz as Hospice of Santa Cruz County and the UCSC Community Studies department co-sponsor her one-woman show, 180 Days, Thursday, February 16, 7-9 p.m. at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center, 320-2 Cedar Street, Santa Cruz. </summary><keywords>uc, ucsc. uc santa cruz, social sciences, community studies, taren sterry, hospice, comedy drama, one-woman show</keywords><start-date>1328306400000</start-date><display-name>Taren Sterry 180 Days</display-name><path>/2012/02/sterry-180-days</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/02/sterry-180-days</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1328305329539</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1328554590905</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Community Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/sterry-taren-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/sterry-taren-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sterry-taren-200.jpg</name><display-name>sterry-taren-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>66559</file-size><width>200</width><height>233</height></image><image-alt>Taren Sterry</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/sterry-taren-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/sterry-taren-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sterry-taren-80.jpg</name><display-name>sterry-taren-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>42957</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Taren Sterry</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Taren Sterry</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Performance stems from experience on a six-month field study</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz alumna Taren Sterry returns to Santa Cruz as Hospice of Santa Cruz County and the UCSC Community Studies department co-sponsor her one-woman show, <em>180 Days</em>, Thursday, February 16, 7-9 p.m. at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center, 320-2 Cedar Street, Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
Sterry is a <a href="http://www.tarensterry.com">writer, performer, and teacher</a> in New York City. She graduated from UCSC in 2001 with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Community Studies and holds a master's in Gerontology and Thanatology from the College of New Rochelle.<br/>
<br/>
She wrote and performs <em>180 Days</em>, a 60-minute comedy drama based on her first six months working in hospice. As part of the community studies field studies requirement at UCSC, Sterry undertook an ethnographic field study to work with terminally ill patients and their families in South Dakota.&#160; &#8220;I thought I was going to go help them figure out their lives,&#8221; she said. Instead, it became &#8220;one of the most transformative experiences in my life.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Hospice is about life stories, Sterry says. She focuses on five patients and their stories in <em>180 Days</em> and has performed to sold-out audiences in New York and at conferences and hospice events around the county. Her performance at Kuumbwa will be followed by a meet-the-artist discussion hosted by UCSC lecturer Wendy Martyna who inspired Sterry at UCSC 10 years ago and continues to teach a popular course, "The Sociology of Death and Dying."</p>
<p>&#8220;This is just the sort of event our program loves to sponsor,&#8221; said Community Studies lecturer Andrea Steiner, &#8220;working in partnership with Santa Cruz organizations to get people informed, engaged, and energized about hidden issues that matter to us all.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Sterry is manager of volunteer services for the Visiting Nurse Service of New York Hospice Care. She is also certified in Training Management at New York University and teaches improv and public speaking. Her passion is entertaining and educating the community about improv and end-of-life issues.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Tickets are $17 advance; $20 at the door; $10 for students and seniors; $30 Hospice supporters. Tickets available in advance at <a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/218536">brownpapertickets.com</a>.<br/>

The project asks bookbinders to create hand-bound photo albums for families to help them recover their family photographs ruined in the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami.<br/>
<br/>
With the support of several film corporations and numerous volunteers, damaged family photos are being cleaned and restored and then placed into artistically-bound albums. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Nakazawa is a paper and book artist</strong> who works in McHenry Library's Special Collections as its paper and book conservator.<br/>
<br/>
She has designed a photo album that features on its covers postal stamps used where the tsunami damage was most severe.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;For the front and back cover&#8217;s design, there are several postal stamps from the six prefectures struck by the quake and Tsunami,&#8221; said Nakazawa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those postal stamps feature local festivals and landscapes where people lived before.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;When this photo album finally reaches a person or family, they will find their tie to the land, history and life,&#8221; she added.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>For the people of this region</strong> who have lost nearly everything they owned, the emotional value of rescued family photos is enormous.<br/>
<br/>
To date, nearly 200 book artists and binders have participated in the project from 14 countries --including Belgium, France, Japan, Canada, the UK, Italy, Greece, Argentina, Spain, Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany.<br/>
<br/>
The OKAERI PROJECT photo albums will be displayed in an exhibition to be held at the Iwate Museum of Art and the Ofunato Civic Cultural Hall in Japan on March 3-25.<br/>
<br/>
The UCSC Library is co-sponsoring Nakazawa&#8217;s participation in this project.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Born in Kumamoto, Japan,</strong> Nakazawa attended college in Tokyo, where she fell in love with sculpture. She moved to the U.S. to study at the Maryland Institute, College of Art in Baltimore.<br/>
<br/>
She also studied bookbinding before moving to New York to work at the New York Botanical Garden as a specialist in conservation.</p>
<p>Nakazawa previously worked in the Preservation Unit of the University Library, before moving to Special Collections and Archives last summer.<br/>

The host galaxy, known as NGC 4449, is the smallest primary galaxy in which a stellar stream from an ongoing merger has been identified and studied in detail.</p>
<p>"This is how galaxies grow. You can see the smaller galaxy coming in and getting shredded, eventually leaving its stars scattered through the halo of the host galaxy," said Aaron Romanowsky, a research astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and coauthor of a paper on the discovery that has been accepted for publication in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> and is available online at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2154">arxiv.org</a>. The study was carried out by an international team of astronomers led by David Mart&#237;nez-Delgado of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg.</p>
<p>According to modern cosmological theory, large galaxies were built up from smaller progenitors through a hierarchical process of mergers. Astronomers can see many examples of mergers involving massive galaxies, but mergers of two dwarf galaxies have been hard to find. "We should see the same things at smaller scales, with small galaxies eating smaller ones and so on," Romanowsky said. "Now we have this beautiful image of a dwarf galaxy consuming a smaller dwarf."</p>
<p>NGC 4449 is located 12.5 million light-years from Earth and is a member of a group of galaxies in the constellation Canes Venatici. In size and morphology, it is very similar to one of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud.</p>
<p>The stellar stream in NGC 4449 was first detected by another group of astronomers as a mysterious, faint smudge in digitized photographic plates from the Digitized Sky Survey project, and it is also visible in archival images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. But if it had been just a bit fainter, more diffuse, or farther from the host galaxy, it could easily have been missed. The authors of the new study called it a "stealth merger," where an infalling satellite galaxy is nearly undetectable by conventional means, yet has a substantial influence on its host galaxy.</p>
<p>Mart&#237;nez-Delgado organized a campaign to follow up on the initial report with more detailed observations. R. Jay GaBany, a Bay Area amateur astronomer and astrophotographer with whom Mart&#237;nez-Delgado has frequently collaborated, obtained exceptionally deep, wide-field images of NGC 4449 with the half-meter Black Bird Observatory telescope (located in the Sierra Nevada mountains). Those images confirmed the presence of a faint substructure in the halo of the galaxy. Romanowsky, along with UCSC graduate student Jacob Arnold, then used the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope in Hawaii to obtain high-resolution images in which the individual stars in the stellar stream can be seen.</p>
<p>"I don't think I'd ever seen a picture of a galaxy merger where you can see the individual stars," Romanowsky said. "It's really an impressive image."</p>
<p>The new observations support the idea that the stellar haloes around many dwarf galaxies are the remnants of smaller satellites that were shredded in past merger events. The ongoing merger in NGC 4449 may also be responsible for the intense burst of star formation seen in the galaxy. "This galaxy is famous for its starburst activity, and it seems we've found the reason for that. The gravitational interaction of the incoming galaxy has probably disturbed the gas in the main galaxy and caused it to start forming stars," Romanowsky said.</p>
<p>The companion galaxy was also independently discovered by a team of scientists led by UCLA astronomer Michael Rich. Their study, based on images obtained by the Centurion 28-inch telescope located at the Polaris Observatory Association near Frazier Park, California, will be published in the February 9 issue of <em>Nature</em>.</p>

A massive influx of hatchery-raised fish that return to spawn in the wild is masking the fact that too few wild fish are returning to sustain a natural population in the river.</p>
<p>The study, published in the online journal <em>PLoS ONE,</em> highlights the danger of relying on census techniques to evaluate the health of wild salmon populations and their habitats. Most hatchery fish in California are unmarked and therefore undetectable in population surveys. For this study, the researchers were able to identify hatchery fish by using a novel technique to detect traces of a hatchery diet preserved in the ear bones of adult fish.</p>
<p>"We expected to find hatchery fish, but the sheer number of hatchery fish returning to spawn in the wild is surprising," said first author Rachel Johnson, a fishery biologist affiliated with the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz and with the Bay-Delta Office of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. "It looked like a healthy population of fish returning to spawn, but the reality is that without the hatchery fish the wild stocks are not sustaining themselves."</p>
<p>The Mokelumne River is one of the major salmon producing rivers for fall-run Chinook salmon in California. Throughout the Central Valley rivers, returning fall-run Chinook salmon numbers have rebounded since a disastrous year in 2007, which led to the unprecedented closure of the commercial salmon fishing season for consecutive years in 2008 and 2009. In the Mokelumne, the number of returning adult salmon has grown from just 418 in 2008 to more than 18,000 in 2011.</p>
<p>But relying on the census numbers alone provides a false sense of the productivity of the river, Johnson said. The discrepancy between the numbers of fish spawning in the river and the actual survival and productivity of wild fish is a serious issue for conservation efforts aiming to restore the wild populations. "We might not be monitoring the right thing to evaluate the effectiveness of recovery efforts," Johnson said.</p>
<p>The new study reveals just how thoroughly the system is dominated by hatchery fish. The Mokelumne River Fish Hatchery releases several million juvenile Chinook salmon every year. The hatchery fish are protected from many of the hazards that cause mortality among wild fish during the initial freshwater phase of their life cycle. There is growing evidence that the different selective pressures on hatchery fish lead to genetic differences, so that the offspring of hatchery fish may be less fit for life in the wild than naturally produced fish. This is especially worrisome if, as the new study suggests, hatchery fish are gradually replacing the wild population.</p>
<p>"We could be doing more harm than we recognize," Johnson said. "Humans are influencing the wild stocks, but we have not been adequately measuring that in our monitoring of endangered species."</p>
<p>This concern applies globally to several species of salmon and steelhead, from Japan to the U.S. west coast, she said. "We used the Mokelumne River as a case study to highlight the implications of not monitoring hatchery fish in the wild. But the practice of releasing enormous numbers of unmarked hatchery-produced fish to enhance salmon stocks remains the cornerstone of salmon conservation and harvest management worldwide."</p>
<p>The researchers based their findings on an analysis of ear bones, called otoliths, from fish collected after spawning in fall 2004. Coauthor Peter Weber of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory led the development of the technique for analyzing chemical signatures in the otoliths. These bones grow in increments over the life of the fish and incorporate elements from the fish's diet. Hatchery feed is largely derived from marine fish meal, which leaves a chemical signature distinctly different from that found in wild fish. This signature from a fish's early diet can be detected even several years after it has left the hatchery.</p>
<p>Nearly 12,000 fish returned and spawned in the Mokelumne watershed in 2004. Most were hatchery fish that returned to the hatchery, but about 1,500 fish spawned in the river. The otolith analysis showed that only ten percent of those spawning in the river were produced there, and only 4 percent of the total spawning population were of natural origin.</p>
<p>"When you use the raw fish counts, it looks like the population is doing well. But if you look at the number of fish that are produced in the wild and return to spawn in the wild, and you follow them through the cycle, you see that the wild fish don't survive at a high enough rate to replace their parents. So the habitat is not supporting a sustainable wild population," Johnson said.</p>
<p>Mass marking of all hatchery fish would make it easier to distinguish between hatchery and natural-origin fish in population surveys and to actively manage for the recovery of wild populations, she said. Currently, most California hatcheries mark a fixed proportion of the salmon they produce, which helps researchers track them.</p>
<p>"In the Pacific Northwest, many hatcheries mark all of their fish by clipping off the adipose fin. They operate segregation weirs to create 'salmon sanctuaries,' so that hatchery fish can be managed separately to reduce the risk of them spawning with wild fish, competing for habitat, or potentially reducing the fitness of wild populations," Johnson said.</p>
<p>In addition to Johnson and Weber, the coauthors of the paper include John Wikert and Michelle Workman of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bruce MacFarlane of the National Marine Fisheries Service, and Marty Grove and Axel Schmitt of UCLA.

<br/>
Founded in 1999 as the <a href="http://smithsociety.ucsc.edu/index.html">Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society</a>, it was California&#8217;s first UC-based comprehensive path to college admission for foster youths and other independent students.<br/>
<br/>
The program provides students with scholarships, but more significantly, says founder Bill Dickinson (Cowell, '68, philosophy) it provides a self-perpetuating community of support. Over the past 13 years, 232 students have participated, including 67 currently enrolled. With 122 graduates and 12 transfers to other colleges, the graduation rate of Smith Collegiate Fellows, as they are known, is higher than the UC and UCSC average. Only 25 are no longer attending and did not receive a degree.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>It's the community</strong><br/>
<br/>
The scholarships are small, about $1,000 per student. "It's not the money," said Dickinson. "It's the community.<br/>
<br/>
"I have always loved Margaret Mead's idea that a small group of committed people can change the world," he said. "I learned at UCSC to take an idea and not just say 'isn't that a nice idea' but ask how do you actually go live it."<br/>
<br/>
For his vision and success, Dickinson will be honored with the UC Santa Cruz Fiat Lux Award at the campus's ninth Scholarship Benefit Dinner, Saturday, February 25 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose. The award is presented to alumni and friends who have demonstrated outstanding achievement, dedication, and service in support of the university&#8217;s programs and goals.<br/>

Dickinson recalls that as the 30th reunion of UCSC's Pioneer Class approached, he wanted to "start a little scholarship" as a living memorial to Page Smith, the historian and founding Cowell College provost, and his artist wife, Eloise.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Restoring dignity</strong><br/>
<br/>
The Smiths had been instrumental in Dickinson's growth from a teenager, who at age 15 left a foster care system that took away his dignity, into a college student who had it restored.<br/>
<br/>
A classmate challenged him. "It's not enough to give money to honor Page Smith," she said. "You need to show up and be Page Smith." Part of being Page Smith is living the motto Smith coined for Cowell College: "Pursuit of truth in the company of friends." It's the motto of the Smith Society, too.<br/>
<br/>
Now called the Smith Renaissance Society, it relies on the occasional grant and donations from supporters. It includes a volunteer mentor for any Smith student who would like one. The mentors &#8211; there are 33 this year &#8211; are UCSC alumni, staff, and faculty, who are supported by other dedicated staff members in the admissions, financial aid, and Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students (STARS) offices.</p>
<p>Though the Smith Scholarships are relatively small, Smith Collegiate Fellows are usually eligible for significant financial aid from a variety of other sources, facilitated by UCSC staff.</p>
<p>"We have an incredibly loyal group of volunteers, mentors, and donors who give very freely of their time, love, and money," Dickinson said.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Paying forward</strong><br/>
<br/>
A key to the program's continued success is the notion of "paying forward." A prime example is alumnus Deutron Kebebew (Kresge, '03, electrical engineering).&#160; "He's like a son to me," said Dickinson.<br/>
<br/>
Kebebew, a native of Ethiopia, was put into the foster care system at age 14 and was one of the first to become involved with the Smith Society soon after he enrolled at UCSC. He later founded College Camp, which lets high school-age foster-care students stay at UCSC for two nights, attend class, spend time with UCSC students who are former foster youth, and learn about the logistics, possibilities, and challenges of college life.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, he is project director for PAPAS, a Santa Cruz County-based organization that supports fathers' active involvement with their families.<br/>
<br/>
The list of successful Smith graduates is long, with teachers, scholars, actors, social workers, and filmmakers. Among them, Shaeleya Miller (Cowell, '07, sociology) who is working on her Ph.D. at UC Santa Barbara with a research focus on the challenges faced by homeless, gay foster youth.<br/>
<br/>
Another, Matilda Stubbs (Porter, '05, anthropology), who worked for the Girl Scouts after graduation, is now pursuing a Ph.D. at Northwestern University with a focus on foster and homeless youth.<br/>
<br/>
"It's the ripple effect," says Dickinson, " what students go on to do. We're a wonderful investment."</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>The world-renowned Banff Mountain Film Festival (BMFF) will make its 20th annual visit to Santa Cruz this month, hosted once again by UCSC's <a href="http://www.ucscrecreation.com/">Recreation Department</a>.</p>
<p>The much-anticipated event offers audiences the chance to experience a diverse sampling of global mountain culture&#8212;a broad category of topics that range from breathtaking snow sport exhibitions and harrowing tales of wilderness survival to cultural and environmental documentaries.</p>
<p>Film screenings will take place on Friday and Saturday, February 24 and 25, at the Rio Theatre on Soquel Avenue. Profits from the festival will go to benefit UCSC's Wilderness Orientation program.</p>
<p>BMFF, a program of the Alberta, Canada&#8211;based Banff Centre, is the largest mountain festival in the world, and one of the most prestigious. Each November, following a Sundance-esque debut festival at the World Heritage Site town of Banff, the best-received films set out on a world tour that visits nearly 400 locations across the globe. Of those sites, roughly half choose to use the festival as a fundraising event to support local outdoor or environmental programs.</p>
<p><strong>UCSC's Wilderness Orientation Program</strong></p>
<p>Wilderness Orientation (WO), the beneficiary of BMFF's Santa Cruz screening, is one such outdoor program. Since 1983, WO has offered incoming UCSC freshmen and transfer students the opportunity to backpack deep into the Sierra Nevada Mountains for a 10-day wilderness experience. The program currently sends groups of 12 students, along with two instructors and a veteran student volunteer, on a trip that includes rock climbing, a peak ascent, and a 24-hour solo hike.</p>
<p>Part of WO's goal is to integrate students into the start of their college career, and the trips include discussions of college life and some of the issues that arise for new students.</p>
<p>Since the Recreation Department began hosting BMFF in 1992, the festival has helped to raise over $130,000 for the WO program, according to festival organizer Kathleen Ferraro, senior recreation supervisor at UCSC.</p>
<p>Longtime local BMFF sponsors include Pacific Edge Climbing Gym and the Baytree Bookstore, according to Ferraro. Thanks to their support, the department expects to raise $12,000 from this year's festival, she said.</p>
<p><strong>Adventure, adrenaline, and environment</strong></p>
<p>This year's Santa Cruz BMFF lineup features some of the festival's top award winners, as well as a number of other audience favorites.</p>
<p>Friday's screening will include six films, with a focus on adventure stories. The films' subjects include a visually stunning exploration of pristine Alaskan glaciers (<strong><em>Blue Obsessions</em></strong>), a fearless 9-year-old female climbing prodigy (<strong><em>Origins&#8212;Obe &amp; Ashima</em></strong>), and "a suspenseful &#8230; and ultimately tragic paddling expedition deep into" the African Congo (<strong><em>Kadoma</em></strong>).</p>
<p>Saturday's audience will be treated to a total of nine films, with a focus on adrenaline and environmental topics. The night's lineup includes a rock climbing expedition set deep in the Chadian desert (<strong><em>Towers of the Ennedi</em></strong>), the tale of a mountain sportsman reclaiming his passion after a catastrophic accident (<strong><em>The Freedom Chair</em></strong>), and an environmental documentary that follows a pair of activists seeking to preserve the natural beauty of British Columbia in the face of a new oil pipeline (<strong><em>SPOIL</em></strong>).</p>
<p>Saturday's screening will also include the festival's 2011 Grand Prize Winner, <strong><em>Cold</em></strong>, an unsettling yet gripping documentary that explores the physical and mental limits of human endurance.</p>
<p>While different films will screen on each night, festival organizer Ferraro, who arranged the programs, was eager to make clear that both nights would present an eclectic array of topics. "I try to balance the films so if you only come for one night you still get kayaking, you get mountaineering, you get culture," she explained.</p>
<p>Both Friday and Saturday's screenings will run a total of 130 minutes, with individual films running anywhere from 4 to 45 minutes in length. Tickets are on sale now (see below for details), and Ferraro warned that they tend to sell out at least one week in advance.</p>

<br/>
The 340-page paperback anthology is a collection of 29 stories drawn from a larger archive of oral histories collected by the Regional History Project in 2010. <br/>
<br/>
It documents a dynamic community of farmers, researchers, activists, and educators, who speak for themselves about the transformative movement that emerged in the late 1960&#8217;s on the California coast.&#160;&#160; <br/>
<br/>
Titled <strong>Cultivating a Movement: An Oral History of Organic Farming and Sustainable Agriculture on California&#8217;s Central Coast</strong>, the book focuses primarily on developments in Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Benito, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.<br/>
<br/>
However, many of the interviewees have gone on to influence sustainable food policy on both the national and international level.<br/>
<br/>
As food policy expert, chair of the Nutrition Education Program at Columbia University, and beloved garden writer Joan Dye Gussow, whom the <em>New York Times</em> called &#8220;matriarch of the eat-locally-think-globally food movement,&#8221; notes:<br/>
<br/>
&#160;&#8220;If you find yourself depressed about the possibilities for positive change, pick up <em>Cultivating a Movement</em> and read a few stories told by people who have been devoting their lives to creating a sustainable food system in the heartland of agribusiness.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Cultivating a Movement</strong> features people like Mark Lipson, who was the first paid staff member for California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF)--one of the first organizations to perform organic certification in North America.<br/>
<br/>
CCOF and Lipson worked with then-Assembly member Sam Farr to pass the 1990 California Organic Foods Act, which established standards for organic food production and sales in California. Those standards later became the basis for the federal National Organic Program. <br/>
<br/>
Lipson is now the Organic and Sustainable Agriculture Policy Advisor for the United States Department of Agriculture.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The book also includes</strong> Jim Cochran, who founded Swanton Berry Farm on the North Coast of Santa Cruz County, becoming the first commercial organic strawberry grower in the United States. <br/>
<br/>
Cochran researched organic growing methods with <strong>UCSC professor of agroecology Steve Gliessman</strong>, noting in his oral history how he &#8220;went back to good, old-fashioned farming practices, which are crop rotation and adding good soil amendments. Managing soil disease was a problem that Steve Gliessman and I worked out, looking at some of the old literature and coming up with the notion that Brassica families&#8212;plants like broccoli or Brussels sprouts or mustards&#8212;might help suppress soil disease.&#8221; <br/>
<br/>
Today, Cochran is an important resource in the current controversy over industrial agriculture&#8217;s use of methyl iodide on strawberries and other crops. <br/>
<br/>
Gliessman is now an internationally recognized leader in the field of agroecology and founding director of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Cultivating a Movement also features interviews</strong> with Tim Galarneau, who spearheaded the movement to transform dining services at UCSC to emphasize local, organic food; UCSC&#8217;s Chadwick Garden manager Orin Martin, who is widely known for his skills as a master orchardist, teacher, and horticulturalist; and UCSC&#8217;s CASFS director Patricia Allen, one of the nation&#8217;s most prominent scholars on the social aspects of food production, distribution, and access.<br/>
<br/>
The volume also spotlights the latest generation of farmers such as Cynthia Sandberg, cultivator for Iron Chef David Kinch&#8217;s Manresa Restaurant in Los Gatos, and Maria In&#233;s Catalan, the first Latina migrant farm worker to own and operate a certified organic farm in California. <br/>
<br/>
Irene Reti--director of the UCSC Library&#8217;s <em>Regional History Project</em> and co-editor of <em>Cultivating a Movement</em> with UCSC writing and environmental studies lecturer Sarah Rabkin--said she hopes her new book will &#8220;not only be read by the growing number of Americans involved in the local and organic food movements, but also studied in college classes in agroecology, organic farming, and the history of social movements.&#8221; <br/>
<br/>
<strong>A reading for the book will be held at Bookshop Santa Cruz on February 22</strong>, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Admission is free. <br/>
<br/>
The complete archive of transcripts, audio clips, photographs, and other resources from the larger oral history series is available on the UCSC Library&#8217;s <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/cultiv/home" title="website">website</a> . <br/>

From: Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway<br/>
Re: Progress toward our "Five for 2015" initiatives<br/>
<br/>
Nearly eight months ago, I announced <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/05/galloway-goals.html">five student-focused priorities</a> for the campus. Dubbed "Five for 2015," these remain my top campus goals as we anticipate UCSC's 50th anniversary in 2015. I want to underscore the urgency of this work and thank the faculty and staff who are moving these goals forward.<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; <strong>Four years or less</strong>: Given the increasing total cost of education, our students should be able to graduate in four years&#8212;or less. Over the summer and fall, all majors were mapped as to the entry points, gateway courses, and prerequisites. Now Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education Richard Hughey and the Academic Senate are working with academic departments to review major requirements, qualification policies, and learning outcomes. These actions will allow us to improve campuswide curriculum planning and course availability. In order to help meet curricular needs, we are also asking Summer Session to offer more classes that are needed by departments. <br/>
<br/>
&#8226; <strong>Increased retention</strong>: During the fall, Director of Institutional Research Julian Fernald completed a comprehensive analysis of our retention data. Among the things we learned is that we must help our lowest-performing students earlier, and we need to increase the range of challenging opportunities available to our highest-performing students. VPDUE Hughey is also overseeing this work. <br/>
<br/>
&#8226; <strong>Increase nonresident student enrollment</strong>: A record number of out-of-state and international students were among the more than 40,000 students who applied to UCSC for admission this fall. We expect to make progress toward our goal of increasing nonresident enrollment to 5 percent of total undergraduates. This shift will help our students build the global networks they will need, and it will bring much-needed new resources to campus.<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; <strong>Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) status</strong>: UCSC will achieve HSI status when Hispanic students make up 25 percent of our undergraduate enrollment, a milestone we expect to attain this coming fall. This achievement reflects our commitment to serve the state by attracting a student population that reflects the demographics of California. <br/>
<br/>
&#8226; <strong>Financial stability</strong>: We are pursuing this goal on three fronts. First, as I hope you've heard, UC's budget is in the hands of voters, who will decide in November whether to approve Gov. Brown's ballot measure to raise taxes and generate new revenues for the state&#8212;and therefore UC. We need your help, because it will take the commitment of the entire UC family&#8212;students, staff, faculty, alumni, and friends&#8212;to educate voters regarding what's at stake in the November election. If you haven't registered as a UC advocate, please do so <a href="http://www.ucforcalifornia.org/santacruz/home/">here</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Second, the chancellor and I continue to call for a revision in the allocation of state funds among the UC campuses. This "rebenching" effort is difficult as all campuses are feeling the strain of budget cuts over the last few years.&#160; However, bringing transparency to the process by which state funds are allocated to the campuses is essential for our students as well as the citizens of the state.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, our fundraising efforts are increasing. Donors gave nearly 10 percent more to the campus last year than the year before, and the chancellor, deans, and I are spending more time on strategic fundraising initiatives.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these initiatives is critical because each is central to our ability to give students an extraordinary educational experience. I welcome your input and invite all students, staff, and faculty to share your thoughts about these initiatives, and any other topics on your mind, during my next open office hours on Friday, Feb. 10, from 10 to 11:30 a.m. in Quarry Plaza. I hope to see you there.<br/>

Para: Profesorado y Personal de la Universidad de California, Santa Cruz<br/>
De parte de: Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway<br/>
Sobre: Progreso en nuestras iniciativas "Cinco para el 2015&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Hace casi ocho meses, anunci&#233; <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/05/galloway-goals.html">cinco prioridades enfocadas en los/as estudiantes</a> para el campus. Dobladas como &#8220;Cinco para el 2015&#8221;, estas prioridades siguen siendo mis objetivos principales en el campus, a medidad que nos acercamos al 50 aniversario de UCSC en el a&#241;o 2015. Quiero hacer hincapi&#233; sobre la urgencia de este trabajo y agradecer al profesorado y personal que est&#225;n avanzando estos objetivos.<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; <strong>Cuatro a&#241;os o menos</strong>: Dado el aumento en el costo total de la educaci&#243;n, nuestros/as estudiantes deber&#237;an poder graduarse en cuatro a&#241;os, o menos. En el verano y en el oto&#241;o, todas las carreras fueron asignadas en cuanto a los puntos de entrada, cursos de enlace y requisitos previos. Ahora, el Vice Provost y Decano de la Educaci&#243;n de Pregrado Richard Hughey y el Senado Acad&#233;mico est&#225;n trabajando con los departamentos acad&#233;micos para revisar los requisitos m&#225;s importantes, las pol&#237;ticas de calificaciones y los resultados de aprendizaje. Estas acciones nos permitir&#225;n mejorar la planificaci&#243;n curricular y la disponibilidad de cursos en todo el campus. Con el fin de ayudar a satisfacer las necesidades curriculares, tambi&#233;n estamos pidiendo a la Sesi&#243;n de Verano que ofrezcan m&#225;s clases que los departamentos necesitan. <br/>
<br/>
&#8226; <strong>Aumento de la retenci&#243;n</strong>: Durante el oto&#241;o, el Director de Investigaci&#243;n Institucional Julian Fernald complet&#243; un an&#225;lisis exhaustivo de los datos de nuestra retenci&#243;n.&#160; Entre las cosas que aprendimos est&#225; que debemos ayudar con m&#225;s prontitud a nuestros/as estudiantes de rendimiento m&#225;s bajo, y tenemos que aumentar la gama de oportunidades desafiantes a disposici&#243;n de nuestros/as estudiantes de rendimiento m&#225;s alto. El Vice Provost y Decano de la Educaci&#243;n de Pregrado Richard&#160; Hughey tambi&#233;n est&#225; a cargo de esta labor.<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; <strong>Aumento en la matriculaci&#243;n de estudiantes no residentes</strong>: Un n&#250;mero r&#233;cord de estudiantes extranjeros y de otros estados se encontraba entre los m&#225;s de 40.000 estudiantes que solicitaron admisi&#243;n en la UCSC este oto&#241;o. Esperamos progresar en nuestro objetivo de aumentar la matriculaci&#243;n de estudiantes no residentes al 5 por ciento del total de estudiantes de pregrado. Este cambio ayudar&#225; a nuestros/as estudiantes a construir las redes globales que necesitar&#225;n, al mismo tiempo que traer&#225; a nuestro campus nuevos y muy necesarios recursos.<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; <strong>Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) status (status o categor&#237;a de Instituci&#243;n de Servicio Hispano)</strong>: UCSC alcanzar&#225; el status de HSI cuando el n&#250;mero de estudiantes hispanos constituya el 25 por ciento de la matriculaci&#243;n de nuestros/as estudiantes de pregrado: un hito que esperamos alcanzar el pr&#243;ximo oto&#241;o. Este logro refleja nuestro compromiso de servir al estado, atrayendo a una poblaci&#243;n estudiantil que refleja la demograf&#237;a de California.<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; <strong>Estabilidad financiera</strong>: Estamos llevando a cabo este objetivo en tres frentes. Primero, como pienso que ya se habr&#225;n enterado, el presupuesto de la Universidad de California est&#225; en las manos de los/as votantes, que decidir&#225;n en noviembre si aprueban la medida puesta para votaci&#243;n por el gobernador Brown con el fin de&#160; aumentar los impuestos y as&#237; generar nuevos ingresos para el estado, y por lo tanto para la Universidad de California. Necesitamos su ayuda, porque va a ser necesario el compromiso de toda la familia de UC: estudiantes, personal, profesorado, ex-alumnos/as y amigos y amigas, para educar a los/as votantes con respecto a lo que est&#225; en juego en las elecciones de noviembre. Si no se ha registrado como defensor/a de UC, por favor h&#225;galo <a href="http://www.ucforcalifornia.org/santacruz/home/">aqu&#237;</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Segundo, el rector y yo seguimos pidiendo una revisi&#243;n de la asignaci&#243;n de fondos estatales entre las distintas escuelas de UC. Este esfuerzo es dif&#237;cil, ya que todas las escuelas de UC est&#225;n sintiendo la presi&#243;n de los recortes presupuestarios en los &#250;ltimos a&#241;os. Sin embargo, el traer transparencia al proceso por medio del cual los fondos estatales son asignados a las distintas escuelas de UC, es esencial para nuestros/as estudiantes as&#237; tambi&#233;n como para los/as ciudadanos/as del estado.<br/>
<br/>
Por &#250;ltimo, nuestros esfuerzos de recaudaci&#243;n de fondos est&#225;n en aumento. Los/as&#160; donantes dieron a nuestro campus cerca del 10 por ciento m&#225;s el a&#241;o pasado que el a&#241;o anterior, y el rector, los/as decanos/as y yo estamos dedicando m&#225;s tiempo a iniciativas estrat&#233;gicas de recaudaci&#243;n de fondos.<br/>
<br/>
Cada una de estas iniciativas es fundamental, porque cada una de ellas es central a nuestra habilidad de dar a los/as estudiantes una experiencia educacional extraordinaria. Sus comentarios son bienvenidos.&#160; Invito a todos/as los/as estudiantes, personal y profesorado a compartir sus ideas sobre estas iniciativas y sobre cualquier otro tema que tengan en mente, durante las pr&#243;ximas horas de oficina abierta que tendr&#233; el viernes, 10 de febrero, desde las 10 hasta las 11:30 de la ma&#241;ana en Quarry Plaza. &#161;Espero ver a ustedes all&#237;!<br/>

<br/>
Criteria are excellent academics, generous financial aid, and/or relatively low cost of attendance.&#160; Eight UC campuses made the list. <br/>
<br/>
"It is indeed gratifying to see UC Santa Cruz and our sister UC campuses recognized in this manner, " said Michael McCawley, UCSC director of admissions. "UCSC continues to provide a high-quality educational experience for our students, even during these difficult budgetary times."<br/>
<br/>
The list highlights 150 undergraduate colleges and universities: 75 public and 75 private institutions.&#160; The company identifies the top 10 in each category, then lists the remaining 65 in alphabetical order, unranked. In a companion article, <em>USA Today</em> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/best-value-colleges">published a searchable database</a> with the same information. <br/>
<br/>
The Princeton Review based its lists on analyses of data collected from an initial list of 650 institutions identified as having excellent academics.&#160; More than 30 data points were considered across three primary areas: academics, cost of attendance, and financial aid.<br/>
<br/>
The Princeton Review also factored in data from surveys of students who shared assessments of their professors and their satisfaction with their financial aid awards.<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="640fb086807270460084d72d16d2c731"><name>mountain-lion-research</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Mountain lion research seminar set for Monday on campus</title><summary>Environmental Studies Professor Chris Wilmers, who has been tracking and studying mountain lions in the Santa Cruz Mountains for three years, will discuss his research at an informational seminar "Mountain Lions and People in the Santa Cruz Mountains,"  7 p.m. Monday, February 13, in Classroom Unit 2.</summary><start-date>1328821200000</start-date><display-name>Mountain lion research</display-name><path>/2012/02/mountain-lion-research</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/02/mountain-lion-research</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1328823644198</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1328823684000</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span></span>Do you want to know more about mountain lions, our large feline neighbors that have been in the news recently with several reported sightings near campus? <br/>

This program is part of the University&#8217;s budget reduction and succession planning strategies.</p>
<p>Under the program, an eligible employee may request to voluntarily reduce his or her percentage of appointment and salary for a minimum period of 120 days up to a maximum period not to extend beyond December 31, 2014.&#160; If the employee continues to participate in the program beyond one year, they must reduce their appointment by at least 10% in each subsequent year of participation. In return the employee receives specified advantages, such as vacation and sick leave accruals based upon their pre-reduced appointment percentage. Additionally, participants receive a lump sum cash payout upon retirement that is equal to half the amount of their reduction in time. The employee must retire at the end of their program contract in order to receive their cash incentive payment.</p>
<p>To be eligible for participation in the program an employee must be an active UCRP member aged 55 or over with five years of retirement service credit and with a career staff appointment of 60% time or greater as of their approved enrollment date in the program. Non-represented staff employees and employees represented by the Coalition of University Employees (CUE) are eligible to participate. Senior Management Group members and academic employees are not eligible for this particular program.&#160; For all other employees represented by unions, eligibility is subject to collective bargaining.&#160;</p>
<p>UCSC will be implementing the Phased Retirement Program effective March 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014. Principal Officers are delegated the authority to determine whether to make this program available to their employees on a divisional basis.&#160; Additionally, individual requests to participate in the program are subject to the approval of departmental management based upon operational needs and service requirements.</p>
<p>Employees who may be considering participation in the Phased Retirement Program should first talk with their supervisors/managers to ensure that their division will be accepting applications.&#160; For those employees requesting participation in the Phased Retirement Program beginning March 1, 2012, completed and approved Phased Retirement contract forms must be received by the appropriate <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/shr_directory/hrst-locator.htm"><span>Employee and Labor Relations (ELR) Analyst</span></a> no later than February 24, 2012.&#160; Thereafter, for employees requesting participation in the Phased Retirement Program effective the first of any given month, completed and approved Phased Retirement contract forms must be received by the appropriate <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/shr_directory/hrst-locator.htm"><span>ELR Analyst</span></a> no later than the 25<span><sup>th</sup></span> of the month prior to the effective date.</p>

Entitled "Across a Sea of Suns: Charting Distant Worlds, Other Earths," the lecture is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>The annual Faculty Research Lecture is the foremost academic research honor bestowed by the UCSC Academic Senate. It was given to Vogt in recognition of his extraordinary research accomplishments.</p>
<p>Vogt's talk will chronicle his 16-year search, using the telescopes at UC's Lick and Keck Observatories, to find potentially habitable Earth-like worlds around the nearest stars. During his 33 years at UCSC, Vogt has designed, built, and used high-precision spectrometers to find new planets outside our solar system. More than 1,000 planets are now known in and around our stellar neighborhood, but almost all are large gas giants like Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, and Uranus, or small hellish rocky worlds glowing in the heat of their stars like Earth-sized charcoal briquettes. Few if any are likely to provide habitable conditions where life might flourish.</p>
<p>In 2010, Vogt's team announced the discovery of a nearly Earth-sized planet orbiting a nearby star within the "habitable zone," where liquid water could exist on the planet's surface. Further observations are needed to confirm this discovery, which remains controversial. Recently, however, his team announced the discovery of another Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of its star. Vogt said he expects this planet to be much easier to confirm. The discovery of these potentially habitable planets around relatively nearby stars implies that there must be billions of such planets in our galaxy, he said.</p>
<p>Vogt has received many awards for his research, including the Tinsley Prize of the American Astronomical Society, the Carl Sagan Memorial Award of the Planetary Society, and the Prix Andre Lallemand of the Academie des Sciences de France. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1978.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/02/habitable-planet.html</url><title>New super-Earth detected within the habitable zone of a nearby star</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/planet.html</url><title>Newly discovered planet may be first truly habitable exoplanet</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="692a31488072704600e8ddfb155bc019"><name>black-history-month-ucsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Black History Month continues at UCSC</title><summary>A video of the recent Martin Luther King Jr. Convocation, featuring a keynote presentation by acclaimed poet Nikki Giovanni, can now be viewed.

Set in a rainforest bar and brothel in the brutally war-torn land of Congo, the play follows as the establishment&#8217;s shrewd matriarch, Mama Nadi, as she keeps peace between customers from both sides of the civil war, as government soldiers and rebel forces alike choose from her inventory of women, many already &#8220;ruined&#8221; by rape and torture when they were pressed into prostitution. Inspired by interviews she conducted in Africa with Congo refugees, Nottage has crafted an engrossing and uncommonly human story with humor and song served alongside its postcolonial and feminist politics. Also being shown March 2-3 at Stevenson, and March 9-10 at the Oldmeyer Center.</p>

<p>Kay worked at UC Santa Cruz from 1978 to 2001 when she left to take a job at UC Davis.&#160;She retired in 2007.&#160;Colleagues at both campuses admired and respected her and often looked to her for advice and guidance. Shortly after arriving in Woodland, she became involved with cat rescue and adoptions, eventually serving on the governing board of Happy Tails Pet Sanctuary in Sacramento. She enjoyed racquetball, skiing, swimming, going to the beach or just being in the sun, gardening, traveling, Giants baseball, and a recent passion for birding. She was a loving mother and a kind and generous friend.&#160;</p>
<p>She is survived by her son, Andy Johnson, of Klamath Falls, Oregon. &#160;She is also survived by cousins, nieces, nephews, and many friends. She will be dearly missed.</p>
<p>There will be two open houses to celebrate Kay's life. The first will be on February&#160;25,&#160;1:00 to 4:00, in Woodland (RSVP and for directions to <a href="mailto:lasky@sbcglobal.net">lasky@sbcglobal.net</a>); the&#160;second&#160;will be on February&#160;26,&#160;1:00 to 4:00,&#160;Scotts Valley (RSVP and for directions to Andy at <a href="mailto:esagj1@hotmail.com">egasj1@hotmail.com</a>). In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations in Kay's name to Happy Tails Pet Sanctuary (<a href="http://www.happytails.org/">http://www.happytails.org/</a>). &#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Biological Sciences Community</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="69cd7e088072704600e8ddfb2e3ea0d2"><name>van-jones</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Van Jones featured at 'Rebuilding the Dream' event on February 21</title><summary>On Tuesday, February 21, UC Santa Cruz will host Van Jones from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at the Stevenson Event Center.

The possibilities are endless in the unscripted story lines of the game, which uses a sophisticated artificial intelligence system to enable players to shape the social lives of a group of 18 high school students.</p>
<p><em>"Prom Week</em> is a game where the game play revolves around social interaction," said lead developer Josh McCoy, a graduate student in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering who led the development of the artificial intelligence (AI) system at the core of the game. "This was AI-based game design, so the challenge was to create a model of social interaction and then turn it into a game that's vibrant and fun to play."</p>
<p>In January, <em>Prom Week</em> was selected as a finalist for the technical excellence award at the upcoming <a href="http://www.igf.com/">Independent Games Festival</a> (IGF) in San Francisco. It is also in the running for the <a href="http://igf.com/audience.php">audience choice award</a>, and a <a href="http://promweek.soe.ucsc.edu/audience-choice/">special preview release</a> of the game has been made available on the team's web site. The game's official release is on Valentine's Day (Tuesday, February 14), when it will be available to play for free on Facebook and other web platforms.</p>
<p>In the game, each "level" is a different character's story, and the player is presented with goals for the character, such as getting a date with that cute boy in algebra class. The player chooses social actions for their character to take, such as flirting or bragging, and the game plays out the resulting interaction with dialogue and responses that depend on the personalities and back stories of the characters involved. The game's AI system not only generates an interaction appropriate to those characters, it also keeps track of the evolving relationships among the characters as the game proceeds.</p>
<p>"What the characters say to each other and how they respond is dependent on this growing back story of interactions that the player has caused to happen," explained Michael Mateas, associate professor of computer science in the Baskin School of Engineering and director of the <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/">Center for Games and Playable Media</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Mateas and Noah Wardrip-Fruin, also an associate professor of computer science, are the faculty advisers and executive producers for the <em>Prom Week</em> team. They run the <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/eis">Expressive Intelligence Studio</a> (EIS), which focuses on the development of advanced AI to enable new kinds of playable experiences. <em>Prom Week</em> combines rich social simulation with concrete characters in a way that hasn't been done before, Mateas said. "In most games today, you either have concrete characters that have specific personalities and pre-authored dialogue, or you have rich social simulation like you find in the <em>Sims,</em> but none of the characters has a very well-specified personality or back story."</p>
<br/>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8bbT_CxHLuk" width="560"></iframe> <br/>
<p>The social simulation in <em>Prom Week</em> is based in large part on a set of 5,000 social considerations or "rules" that determine what characters want to do and how they respond to the actions of others. To come up with those rules, the team studied social interactions in movies and television shows. "It was like ethnographic note-taking, but with media," said Wardrip-Fruin. "The team would sit down and watch <em>Mean Girls</em> or <em>Sex and the City</em> and identify recurring patterns of social interactions."</p>
<p>The result is a game that captures the complicated and unpredictable nature of human relationships. "It feels fundamentally different from the way social interactions work in other games," said <em>Prom Week's</em> lead writer, graduate student Aaron Reed. "In the same way that <em>Angry Birds</em> allows you to use the physics of the game to come up with alternate ways to solve puzzles, we have a system that lets you solve social situations in different ways that are not predetermined by us."</p>
<p>For this reason, the team often refers to <em>Prom Week's</em> AI system, called Comme il Faut (French for "as is proper"), as a "social physics engine." As Wardrip-Fruin explains, its function is analogous to that of the physics simulations that help make today's blockbuster videogames so visually compelling. "Some of those games have rich unexpected game play because they use a physics engine that keeps track of physical objects in the world of the game. But games about social relationships haven't had that kind of richness," he said.</p>
<p>The combination of computational sophistication and social complexity in <em>Prom Week</em> reflects the diverse multidisciplinary backgrounds of the core team's student members, all currently pursuing Ph.D.s in computer science. Lead developer McCoy's background includes B.A. degrees in sociology and anthropology as well as computer science. Lead writer Reed is a well-known author of interactive fiction and earned an M.F.A. in <a href="http://danm.ucsc.edu/">digital arts and new media</a> at UCSC before joining EIS. Lead game-play designer Michael Treanor also has an M.F.A in digital arts and new media and experience in videogame design. Lead engineer Ben Samuel has B.A. degrees in both computer science and theater arts and is a professional actor, starring in the new Hulu television series <em>Battleground</em>.</p>
<p>"I don't think this game could have been made without students with those kinds of interdisciplinary backgrounds," said Wardrip-Fruin.</p>
<p>In addition to the core team, many other graduate students contributed to the project, as well as undergraduates in computer game design and other programs. Several team members noted that the academic environment at UC Santa Cruz was essential to the making of <em>Prom Week,</em> not only fostering cross-disciplinary interactions but also allowing the team to spend years on an ambitious project for which there was no guarantee of success.</p>
<p>"Our first estimates of how long it would take were horribly optimistic, but that's just the nature of doing something that no one's ever done before," Mateas said.</p>
<p>Now that the game is finished, members of the team are finally able to see how players respond to it. "We've already seen a couple of different styles of play," Reed said. "Some people play casually, just to see what they can make happen. Others really get into the strategy and planning their moves to achieve goals. But it's really exciting to see people respond to the characters and to see that the system is successfully performing a character that we conceived of."</p>
<p>Other groups at the Center for Games and Playable Media are already adapting <em>Prom Week's</em> AI system for use in other games, including "serious games" for teaching conflict resolution and for cultural training purposes. "It provides a general framework for managing and modeling social interactions," Mateas said. "We have three ongoing projects that are adapting it for other kinds of games."</p>
<p>The work on <em>Prom Week</em> was funded in part by the National Science Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="77fcee0e8072704600e4fcbcb254b670"><name>community-bulletin</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Crime Bulletin</title><start-date>1329123600000</start-date><display-name>Community Crime Bulletin</display-name><path>/2012/02/community-bulletin</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/02/community-bulletin</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1329157959065</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1329157959065</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-western"><strong><span>UC SANTA CRUZ POLICE&#160;DEPARTMENT</span></strong>

SIGFIRM was founded in 2011 through a generous seed grant from UCSC alumnus Sharath Sury.<br/>
<br/>
Odean will speak on "The Investor's Worst Enemy," Tuesday, February 28, 2012 from 2-3:30 p.m. in Room 180, the Simularium, in the Engineering 2 building on the UCSC campus. His lecture is free and open to the public.<br/>
<br/>
Spoiler alert: the &#8220;enemy&#8221; in his lecture title is investors themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Odean, the Rudd Family Foundation Professor of Finance in the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, has written widely on behavioral finance based on in-depth studies of individual investors, including day traders, speculators, and investment clubs. He has also studied the broader impact of the Internet on stock trading and investor behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Odean&#8217;s research over the past two decades has shown that individual investors (particularly men) exhibit overconfidence, excessive trading, a tendency to follow the crowd, and stubbornness. These behaviors very often cause investors to buy high, sell low, and pay more in fees and taxes than they otherwise might. He also examines broader factors that disadvantage individual investors relative to big institutions.<br/>
<br/>
Odean&#8217;s work has won several prizes, and been featured in non-academic outlets such as Forbes magazine. He embarked on his academic career relatively late in life, returning to school after dropping out of Carleton College and spending 15 years in a variety of jobs, ranging from driving cabs to programming computers. He admits to having made many of the mistakes that he now studies so intensively.<br/>
<br/>
Odean's lecture is the second in the SIGFIRM quarterly lecture series that debuted last October with Hal Varian, chief economist at Google. Each quarter, SIGFIRM invites a leading figure who has contributed to the fields of economics and finance both as a researcher and a practitioner to deliver a public lecture at UC Santa Cruz on a topic of major significance to students, faculty, and professionals.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="78f21d7b8072704600e4fcbc42ff4aa1"><name>karen-washington</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Farm apprentice graduate honored in Bronx Black History Month ceremony</title><summary>Karen Washington, a graduate of the 2008 apprenticeship class at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems at UC Santa Cruz, was honored at the annual Black History Month Celebration in the Bronx, N.Y.</summary><keywords>uc, ucsc. uc santa cruz, social sciences, sustainability, casfs, karen washington, bronx green, </keywords><start-date>1329174000000</start-date><display-name>Karen Washington</display-name><path>/2012/02/karen-washington</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/02/karen-washington</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1329174027555</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1329174629420</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/washington_karen-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/washington_karen-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>washington_karen-300.jpg</name><display-name>washington_karen-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>61744</file-size><width>300</width><height>216</height></image><image-alt>Karen Washington with Jose Serrano and José E.

With spring approaching, I wanted to remind you that we&#8217;ll again see a number of visitors to the campus in March and April, many of whom will be our newly admitted frosh and transfer students, along with their family members. In the admissions process, spring is an important time of year as students make decisions about where to enroll next fall. You may have seen that UCSC received over 40,000 applications for fall 2012 &#8211; a record for our campus! This is a testament to our entire campus community and the exciting opportunities that are available to our undergraduate students.<br/>
</span></p>
 <span></span> 
<p><span>To support admitted students in their university decision-making process, the Admissions Office is again inviting admitted students and their families to learn more about the campus during the annual <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/visit/spring-spotlight/index.html">UCSC Spring Spotlight from April 6 to 14</a>, including specific sessions for transfer students on April 6 and April 9. Additionally, students can <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/visit/campus-tours.html">schedule a campus tour</a> through the online registration system; admitted students can reserve a spot during Spring Spotlight and other prospective students can reserve a regular tour.<br/>
</span></p>
 <span></span> 
<p><span>We continue to expand yield efforts with on-campus and online activities. Again this year, Admissions is hosting <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/visit/cwl/vssl-2012.html">Virtual Spring Spotlight on April 25</a> through a web-based college fair at CollegeWeekLive. Newly admitted students in California and beyond will have the opportunity to learn more about our academic, campus, and student life programs through live online text and video chats. Admissions is also continuing to partner with <a href="http://engagingeducation.org/joomla/index.php/outreach.html">student-initiated outreach efforts</a>; student organizations play an important role in reaching out to admitted students and welcoming them to the campus.<br/>
</span></p>
 <span></span> 
<p><span>We expect over 6,000 visitors in the next couple of months, including many who will travel from outside of California, and many of these visitors will be curious about university life and academic opportunities and may ask you questions as they tour the campus. It is truly an exciting time for these students and their families, and your helpfulness (and patience) will affirm the positive qualities and character of the UCSC community. Also, if you notice individuals or groups that seem lost, please help them find their way around campus. If you have questions or see areas around campus that need attention, please contact Assistant Director Beatrice Atkinson-Myers in Admissions (<a href="mailto:beatrice@ucsc.edu">beatrice@ucsc.edu</a> or 459-2352) and she will work with the appropriate unit(s) to help create the best possible experience for visitors. Finally, all campus web sites will see increased traffic in the coming months; please take a moment to consider the online presence of your department or unit and find ways to ensure an interesting, accurate, and current presentation of our campus and programs.<br/>

<p>The image was part of UCSC professor Chris Wilmers's recent informational forum about these elusive "charismatic megafauna," whose recent spate of appearances on and near campus have prompted excitement, speculation, and some anxiety.</p>
<p>A woman 15 rows from the front was visibly nervous. "Will you look at the glare on that mountain lion's face?" she said to the people sitting next to her. "My Siamese gives me that same glare all the time. And she only weighs seven pounds!"</p>
<p>The audience member was just one of the many UCSC students and campus and county residents who have been in a heightened state of cougar alert for the past few weeks.</p>
<p>On January 17, two walkers with a dog saw two mountain lions near Pogonip's Spring Street entrance&#8212;a highly popular area for joggers, distance runners, and day hikers. A week later, a UCSC student&#8212;out running on a forested and sparsely traveled section of Chinquapin Road&#8212;saw a mountain lion 25 feet from the unpaved roadbed.</p>
<p>Although the mountain lion did not threaten the student, UCSC police took the precaution of sending out an alert to CruzAlert subscribers that afternoon.</p>
<p>All that excitement led to a big turnout for Wilmers's talk about mountain lions; more than 120 people, including a large assortment of UCSC undergraduates, showed up for the far-ranging talk, which mostly focused on high-tech efforts to understand these creatures' behaviors.</p>
<p>Wilmers also spoke of plans to protect them in the future, in collaboration with Caltrans, perhaps with fencing and redesigned culverts that could cut down on the number of cougars killed during highway crossings.</p>
<p><strong>More dangerous: A cougar or a toothbrush?</strong></p>
<p>Naturally, some audience members also wanted to know about their own safety.</p>
<p>While Wilmers advised people to proceed with caution in any known mountain lion roaming grounds, he also assured them that they had an exponentially greater chance of getting killed by their own toothbrushes than attacked by a mountain lion.</p>
<p>Statistics bear up Wilmers's claim; citing figures from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Book of Odds, an on-line reference of "odds, probability and chances," claims that Americans have roughly a one in 100,000 chance of suffering a serious toothbrush-related injury on any given year and winding up in the emergency room.&#160;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the chances of being injured by a mountain lion fall in the range of one in several million -- while the chances of getting fatally attacked are one in 32 million. Since the year of California&#8217;s statehood &#8211; 1850 -- there have been a total of 16 mountain lion attacks on people, and only six fatalities, two of them because of untreated rabies.</p>
<p>"I'd be more worried about toothbrushes," Wilmers added. "If you want to go running (in the forest) at night, bring a bell or another person. But even if you do everything wrong, the risks (of mountain lion attack) are really, really low."</p>
<p><strong>Big change in views on big cats</strong></p>
<p>Before launching into the scientific aspects of his talk, Wilmers spoke of the dramatic changes in attitudes toward cougars over time.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, he said, even high-ranking biologists advocated the wholesale slaughter of big predators like wolves and cougars. "Scientists later realized predators have a profound effect on ecosystems," he said. Killing off top predators can have disastrous consequences, upsetting the natural balance by creating a "cascade effect" that can lead to an overabundance of prey species or cause lower-level predators such as raccoons and coyotes to overrun the forest.</p>
<p>The killing off of cougars was often the result of fear and misunderstanding, he said.</p>
<p>Now, high-tech methods are helping scientists close that understanding gap through the use of telemetric collars, which must be placed on the creatures out in the field, after finding them, often with help from tracking dogs, and anesthetizing them. The collars relay steady data streams. A visual representation of that data looks like a cross between an EKG print-out and the shaking lines of a seismograph; by studying these wavering patterns, scientists can deduce mountain lion movement and behaviors ranging from the 'pounce' to the slow retreat.</p>
<p>"We want to understand the animals' behavior in real time," Wilmers said. "Is the animal running? How fast? We hope to identify when the animals are eating, drinking, sleeping, and where they are when they're doing this, and how they behave when they're near humans."</p>
<p><strong>Increasing understanding</strong></p>
<p>These technologies also help Wilmers and his team understand the challenges cougars face when living near an urban environment like Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#160;"This is a very urbanized, human dominated area," he said, while mentioning that fragmentation of mountain lion territory can result in "habitat islands" with isolated, vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>He noted that Highway 17 slices straight through some of the animal's roaming area; he showed an alarming photo of a mountain lion with a gaping wound that reached 12 inches across its flank. Trying to cross the highway, the cougar got hit by a car and dragged. The audience gasped when Wilmers noted that the animal "managed to survive and is now doing quite well."</p>
<p>By the end of the evening, one audience member became so curious about mountain lions that he asked how he might increase his chance of an encounter.</p>
<p>"If you're driving remote dirt roads at night, that's probably your best chance of seeing one," Wilmers responded. "Mountain lions like remote."</p>
<p>While Wilmers said that humans in Santa Cruz County should not panic about the presence of mountain lions, he advised the owners of goats to consider keeping them in a "fully-enclosed mountain lion-proof structure."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://santacruzpumas.org/</url><title>Santa Cruz Pumas: keep up with UCSC "puma tracking" and mountain lion studies online</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/01/mountain-lion-safety.html</url><title>Just in case you see one: safety tips -- mountain lions</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/cougarthumbnail80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/cougarthumbnail80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cougarthumbnail80.jpg</name><display-name>cougarthumbnail80.jpg</display-name><file-size>25838</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="81c3c074807270460101522caaa96116"><name>young-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Physicist Peter Young receives Humboldt Research Award</title><summary>The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation has elected physicist Peter Young to receive a Humboldt Research Award.</summary><keywords>Peter Young, Humboldt Research Award</keywords><start-date>1329296400000</start-date><display-name>Humboldt Research Award</display-name><path>/2012/02/young-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/02/young-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1329321983318</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1329322069874</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/peter-young-150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/peter-young-150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>peter-young-150.jpg</name><display-name>peter-young-150.jpg</display-name><file-size>52175</file-size><width>150</width><height>192</height></image><image-alt>peter young</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/peter-young-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/peter-young-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>peter-young-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>peter-young-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21446</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>peter young</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Peter Young</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation has elected A. Peter Young, professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, to receive a Humboldt Research Award this year. The award is conferred in recognition of lifetime achievements in research, and recipients are invited to carry out research projects in cooperation with specialist colleagues in Germany.</p>
<p>Young will be visiting the University of Oldenburg as a Humboldt laureate in 2012 and 2013. There he will collaborate with Professor Alexander Hartmann on the physics of disordered systems and new numerical techniques with which to study them.</p>
<p>Young studies phase transitions in random systems, such as the highly disordered magnetic systems known as "spin glasses." Research on spin glasses has led to advances in many other areas of science, including brain function, optimization problems in computer science, and high-temperature superconductors. Young also studies phase transitions driven by quantum fluctuations rather than thermal fluctuations.</p>
<p>The Humboldt Foundation grants up to 100 Humboldt Research Awards annually, each valued at 60,000 euros. The awards are granted to academics whose fundamental discoveries, new theories, or insights have had a significant impact on their own discipline and who are expected to continue producing cutting-edge achievements in the future.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="81d13aa7807270460101522cf587acf2"><name>cowell-fountain-celebration</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pioneer alumni return for Cowell fountain celebration</title><start-date>1329296400000</start-date><display-name>Cowell fountain and art celebration</display-name><path>/2012/02/cowell-fountain-celebration</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/02/cowell-fountain-celebration</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1329322867263</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1329323692711</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/fountain-smaller.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/fountain-smaller.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fountain-smaller.jpg</name><display-name>fountain-smaller.jpg</display-name><file-size>71933</file-size><width>233</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The eight-foot-high abstract Cowell Fountain, also known as the Edna L.

Genn designed the Cowell Fountain and an exhibition of her work , &#8220;The Shape of Water&#8221; , in the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery at 2 PM kicks off the day&#8217;s events.</p>
<p>In 1966, the dedication ceremony was presided over by Page Smith, Cowell&#8217;s first Provost and founding father; this time around, Cowell&#8217;s current Provost, Faye Crosby, will lead a joyous procession from the Gallery to the Fountain at 3 PM where attendees will be treated to the fanfare of that first ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>&#160;</strong>As in the original celebration there will be trumpeters and banner-waving celebrants &#8212; along with a reunion performance of the original Cowell Madrigal singers, once again directed by Paul Rabwin (Cowell '70), who has gone on to be a multiple Emmy-award nominee and Golden Globe&#8211;winning television producer. Gary Young, Santa Cruz Poet Laureate, will read &#8220;The Fountain Poem&#8221;, by James Biffle (Cowell &#8217;66). Cowell&#8217;s current <em>a Capella</em> group, &#8220;Acquire&#8221;, will also perform.</p>
<strong><span></span></strong> 
<p>The eight-foot-high abstract Cowell Fountain, also known as the Edna L. Scott Fountain is the earliest artwork on the UCSC campus. The gift of two anonymous donors, it honors the 4<sup><span>th</span></sup> <span>grade Mission Hill teacher and a descendent of the Scott family, founders of Scotts Valley.&#160; The fountain also has a special significance. In the early days it was a meeting place for Cowell student &#8220;pioneers&#8221;, who were among UCSC&#8217;s first graduates.</span></p>
<p><span>Nancy Genn was present at the original dedication and will return to Cowell for the event. She is an internationally known abstract painter and sculptor who spent two years creating the fountain's centerpiece made from hand-finished cast bronze.&#160; Its abstract form was inspired by nature.</span></p>
<p><span>Also on view in Cowell&#8217;s Smith Gallery, February 26 &#8211; March 11, will be the work of Philosophy Professor Emeritus, Paul Kashup, a founding member of the Cowell College Faculty. Kashup will be exhibiting his sculptures in his exhibit &#8220;Contemplation the Female Form.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Celebrants will adjourn to Page Smith Library after the ceremony for conviviality and conversation with old classmates and professors.</span></p>

</strong></p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>UCSC emeritus professor</strong> of education and creative writing David Swanger has been named the second Poet Laureate of Santa Cruz County.<br/>
<br/>
He succeeds UCSC humanities lecturer Gary Young, who has served in the position for the past two years.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
The Poet Laureate is an initiative of the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County--in collaboration with Poetry Santa Cruz--and is designed to advance, enliven, and promote the art of poetry throughout the county.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;This is a special place in terms of being a paradise for poets,&#8221; Swanger noted.&#160; "There are many fine accomplished poets living here, and we have a plethora of classes, readings, workshops, and informal gatherings of poets.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;But there is also an entire population of poets and poetry lovers who are not part of the visible, published and performing cohort,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
Swanger recalled that years ago, he ran a weekly poetry feature in the <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em>. During that time, he helped publish over 200 poems from people outside the recognized arena of poetry in Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It was an enriching experience for me and I hope a powerful experience for the people I published,&#8221; said Swanger<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;As poet laureate, in addition to working with established colleagues in poetry, my plan is to once again reach out to people and places where poetry is not as much a part of the conversation.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Prior to his retirement</strong> in 2005, Swanger taught educational philosophy for the Education Department at UC Santa Cruz, and poetry classes for the Literature Department.<br/>
<br/>
He was a longtime friend of renowned short story writer and poet <strong>Raymond Carver</strong>, whom he met at UCSC when they both arrived on campus to teach in 1971.<br/>
<br/>
In 2002, Swanger donated a collection of letters he received from Carver to UCSC&#8217;s Special Collections.<br/>
<br/>
Swanger has written four books of poetry and is also the author of <em>The Poem as Process</em> and <em>Essays in Aesthetic Education</em>.<br/>
<br/>
In 2005, his poetry book, <em>Wayne&#8217;s College of Beauty: New and Selected Poems</em>, was selected from more than 400 entrants to receive the John Ciardi Prize in Poetry.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Prairie Home Companion</em> host Garrison Keillor chose a poem from that book, &#8220;Patriarch at the Lake,&#8221; to read on National Public Radio&#8217;s&#160; <em>Writers&#8217; Almanac</em> program.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Poetry is important, as it has always been, for expressions of the human condition and our connections with each other,&#8221; said Swanger.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;You discover your own feelings that you didn&#8217;t know you had, and have a form in which you can share them. Poetry can teach us empathy, in that we can feel what others feel when the poem is right.&#8221;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Santa Cruz&#8217;s new Poet Laureate will perform multiple readings throughout the county this April in celebration of National Poetry Month.<br/>
<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br/>
<strong>Patriarch at the Lake</strong></p>
<p><strong>The aunts, splendid, pale</strong><br/>
<strong>and ample in their bathing suits,</strong><br/>
<strong>unfurled tablecloths, challa, melons,</strong><br/>
<strong>seltzer water in blue bottles, and</strong><br/>
<strong>honey cakes and other cakes.</strong><br/>
&#160;<br/>
<strong>After the required hour everyone</strong><br/>
<strong>but Grandpa waded, stirring silt</strong><br/>
<strong>around our ankles, enjoying mud.</strong><br/>
<strong>Then, as if called by voices beyond</strong><br/>
<strong>&#160;us, the old man rose, his belly taut,</strong><br/>
<strong>trunks reaching his knees, his shins</strong><br/>
<strong>white as fish, and walked without</strong><br/>
<strong>watching the ground toward water.</strong><br/>
&#160;<br/>
<strong>We parted to let him pass, we receded</strong><br/>
<strong>onto the beach; he prowed outward</strong><br/>
<strong>and swam.&#160; He remembered, he stroked</strong><br/>
<strong>and roiled and spumed his way away</strong><br/>
<strong>then back to us, his shorebound spawn.</strong><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The $2,500 award was established to support undergraduate students in the Division of Social Sciences who are passionate about social issues and committed to public service. It honors Gabriel &#8220;Gabe&#8221; Zimmerman (Stevenson, '02, sociology) who was killed in the January 2011 shooting spree in Tucson that wounded his boss, Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.<br/>
<br/>
D&#237;az grew up in Bakersfield, the daughter of Latin American immigrants. After high school, she lived in Paraguay for seven months doing human rights work with Amnesty International before attending community college in Los Angeles. She transferred to UC Santa Cruz in fall 2010.<br/>
<br/>
Since then she has worked with other undergraduates in UCSC's Global Information Internship Program (GIIP) to create and implement a program in Watsonville schools to increase computer literacy among Spanish-speaking parents. She has also worked with other students to start &#8220;Strive for College,&#8221; a program that will help prepare students from underserved and disadvantaged communities to successfully transition from high school to college.<br/>
<br/>
"At a time when most prestigious universities are underscoring the importance of public service for their undergraduate students, UCSC has decided to honor someone<br/>
who has already deeply engaged in community action," said Social Sciences Division Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki.&#160; "UCSC has many students who, just like Gabe<br/>
Zimmerman, are very much involved in helping average citizens improve their quality of life."<br/>
<br/>
The scholarship fund was the brainchild of two UCSC alums Alex Clemens (Porter, '89, international politics) and Jonathan Klein (Merrill, '89, politics) after they learned of Zimmerman's death. Neither Clemens nor Klein knew Zimmerman personally but said they were touched by his dedication to public service and that he was killed in the course of doing his job. Zimmerman served as Giffords' community outreach director and had organized the "congresswoman on the corner" event in Tucson where the shooting occurred.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#160;More than 500 alumni, community members, and the general public contributed to fund an endowment that provides for the annual scholarship.<br/>
<br/>
Klein, Clemens, and professors Eva Bertram, politics, Mary Beth Pudup, community studies, and Craig Reinarman, sociology, served on the scholarship selection committee.<br/>
<br/>
"I am thrilled about Yethz&#233;ll's selection as the very first recipient of the Gabriel Zimmerman Scholarship," Klein said. "I never met Gabe Zimmerman, but was so moved by his remarkable public service, and his tireless advocacy of social justice.&#160; There was no question that starting a scholarship in his name at UCSC was the very least we could do to carry on his efforts."<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Committee chair Reinarman said D&#237;az's &#8220;work on bringing computer literacy to Latino parents and on the "Strive for College" program clearly indicated to the committee her commitment to the sort of efforts to which Gabe Zimmerman devoted his life."<br/>

Now, <a href="http://www.nanoporetech.com/">Oxford Nanopore Technologies</a> of Oxford, U.K., has announced plans to market the first commercial DNA sequencer based on this nanopore technology.</p>
<p>Genetic information is encoded in the sequence of nucleotide subunits in DNA molecules. Scientists have devised many different methods for DNA sequencing, which has become progressively faster and less expensive in recent years. Nanopore sequencing has the potential to become one of the fastest and cheapest approaches yet.</p>
<p>Oxford Nanopore, established in 2005, has license agreements with UC Santa Cruz and other leading institutions in nanopore science, including Harvard University and Boston University. Biomolecular engineers Mark Akeson and David Deamer, who serve on the company's technology advisory board, established the nanopore research group at UC Santa Cruz in 1996.</p>
<p>"Oxford Nanopore is the only company that took our ideas seriously," said Deamer, a research professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UCSC. "It's pretty amazing to see this technology turned into a real commercial device."</p>
<p>Clive Brown, chief technology officer at Oxford Nanopore, presented DNA sequence data from the company's nanopore devices at the <a href="http://agbt.org/">Advances in Genome Biology and Technology</a> (AGBT) conference in Marco Island, Florida, on Friday, February 17. The company said it plans to market its devices directly to customers in 2012, including a miniaturized device it describes as "a disposable DNA sequencing device the size of a USB memory stick whose low cost, portability and ease of use is designed to make DNA sequencing universally accessible."</p>
<p>"We're delighted at this latest success in commercializing UCSC faculty research," said Bruce Margon, vice chancellor for research at UCSC. "An important part of the university mission is not simply education of students and creation of knowledge, but also where possible moving results of that research out into the community where it can benefit society and create positive economic impact. This is a great example."</p>
<p>Deamer first came up with the idea for nanopore sequencing in 1989 when he was at UC Davis. He had done postdoctoral research at UC Berkeley with Daniel Branton (now at Harvard), and they worked on the nanopore idea together, beginning in 1991, and published their first paper in 1996. Deamer and Branton collaborated until 2005 before pursuing different directions in nanopore research.</p>
<p>Akeson, now professor and chair of the Biomolecular Engineering Department, leads the UCSC nanopore group, which has made important advances in nanopore sequencing technology. The group uses a nanopore formed by a self-assembling protein complex called an ion channel, inserted into a membrane similar to a cell membrane. The membrane separates two wells, and an electric field drives DNA strands (which are negatively charged) from one well to the other through the nanopore. The brief blockage of the nanopore by the DNA strands as they pass through the pore produces electrical current modulations that can be analyzed to yield DNA sequence information.</p>
<p>One of the big challenges has been controlling the movement of the DNA through the nanopore. With an unconstrained DNA strand, each subunit (called a nucleotide) zips through the pore in about three microseconds, too fast to get an accurate reading. Akeson's group has focused on the use of enzymes that bind to the DNA to control its movement through the nanopore. A <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nbt.2147.html">paper</a> presenting their latest results was published in <em>Nature Biotechnology</em> on February 14. The first author of the paper, Gerald Cherf, began working on the project as a UCSC undergraduate and is now a junior specialist in Akeson's lab.</p>
<p>"We've taken a natural enzyme that can move the DNA with precision and coupled that to the nanopore. It's doable with a variety of enzymes and is very successful," Akeson said. "Oxford Nanopore has taken that basic approach and improved on it in ways to make it commercially viable."</p>
<p>The UCSC nanopore group has been funded primarily by grants from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), with additional funding from Oxford Nanopore Technologies.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8cba776d8072704601102b986102401c"><name>brain-connections</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New brain connections form in clusters during learning</title><summary>A new study reveals details of how brain circuits are rewired during the formation of new motor memories.</summary><keywords>Yi Zuo, motor learning, dendritic spines, two-photon imaging</keywords><start-date>1329674400000</start-date><display-name>Brain connections study</display-name><path>/2012/02/brain-connections</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/02/brain-connections</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1329505924877</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1330470235596</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/brain-art-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/brain-art-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brain-art-400.jpg</name><display-name>brain-art-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>660767</file-size><width>400</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>brain illustration</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/brain-art-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/brain-art-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brain-art-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>brain-art-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>580295</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>brain illustration</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The formation of "dendritic spines" on pyramidal neurons in the brain accompanies the formation of new motor memories.

Led by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the study reveals details of how brain circuits are rewired during the formation of new motor memories.</p>
<p>The researchers studied mice as they learned new behaviors, such as reaching through a slot to get a seed. They observed changes in the motor cortex, the brain layer that controls muscle movements, during the learning process. Specifically, they followed the growth of new "dendritic spines," structures that form the connections (synapses) between nerve cells.</p>
<p>"For the first time we are able to observe the spatial distribution of new synapses related to the encoding of memory," said Yi Zuo, assistant professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz and corresponding author of the paper.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/11/3413.html">previous study</a>, Zuo and others documented the rapid growth of new dendritic spines on pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex during the learning process. These spines form synapses where the pyramidal neurons receive input from other brain regions involved in motor memories and muscle movements. In the new study, first author Min Fu, a postdoctoral researcher in Zuo's lab, analyzed the spatial distribution of the newly formed synapses.</p>
<p>Initial results of the spatial analysis showed that one third of the newly formed synapses were located next to another new synapse. These clustered synapses tended to form over the course of a few days during the learning period, when the mouse was repeatedly performing the new behavior. Compared to non-clustered counterparts, the clustered synapses were more likely to persist through the learning sessions and after training stopped.</p>
<p>In addition, the researchers found that after formation of the second spine in a cluster, the first spine grew larger. The size of the spine head correlates with the strength of the synapse. "We found that formation of a second connection is correlated with a strengthening of the first connection, which suggests that they are likely to be involved in the same circuitry," Zuo said. "The clustering of synapses may serve to magnify the strength of the connections."</p>
<p>Another part of the study also supported the idea that the clustered synapses are involved in neural circuits specific to the task being learned. The researchers studied mice trained first in one task and then in a different task. Instead of grabbing a seed, the mice had to learn how to handle a piece of capellini pasta. Both tasks induced the formation of clustered spines, but spines formed during the learning of different tasks did not cluster together.</p>
<p>The researchers also looked at mice that were challenged with new motor tasks every day, but did not repeat the same task over and over like the ones trained in seed-grabbing or capellini-handling. These mice also grew lots of new dendritic spines, but few of the new spines were clustered.</p>
<p>"Repetitive activation of the same cortical circuit is really important in learning a new task," Zuo said. "But what is the optimal frequency of repetition? Ultimately, by studying the relationship between synapse formation and learning, we want to find out the best way to induce new memories."</p>
<p>The study used mice that had been genetically altered to make a fluorescent protein within certain neurons in the motor cortex. The researchers used a special microscopy technique (two-photon microscopy) to obtain images of those neurons near the surface of the brain. The noninvasive imaging technique enabled them to view changes in individual brain cells of the mice before, during, and after learning a new behavior.</p>
<p>In addition to Zuo and first author Min Fu, the coauthors of the paper include UCSC graduate student Xinzhu Yu and Stanford University biologist Ju Lu.

<p>The Queer Studies Special Interest Group of the American Educational Research Association (AERA) selected Cruz's article, "LGBTQ street youth talk back: a meditation on resistance and witnessing," as its article of the year for 2012.</p>
<p>The National Association of Chicana and Chicano Studies (NACCS) named the same essay, published in the October 1, 2011 issue of the <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/tqse;jsessionid=1728sjp7qsthf.alice">International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education</a>, as winner of its 2012 Antonia I. Castaneda Award. The article was one of several in a special issue that explored the possibilities and limitations of theories of youth resistance in educational research, and presented new and expanded theories of youth responses to injustices in schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Reviewers noted that Cruz's article was a "strong theoretical piece that counters the usual colonialist frames of research."<br/>
<br/>
Cruz, who joined UCSC in 2008, is also a fellow of the UC Center for Collaborative Research for an Equitable California based at UC Santa Cruz. Its director, UCSC professor of education Ron Glass, commented that&#160; Cruz's "essay seems clearly destined to become a landmark, and these awards from AERA and NACCS represent very significant achievements for this early stage of Cindy's career."</p>
<p>Cruz will receive her awards in March at the NACCS annual meeting in Chicago and in April when AERA holds its annual meeting in Vancouver, B.C.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a1b8e38080727046012c97b386d6e725"><name>thinning-veil</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New Theater Arts drama a ‘grand experiment’ in arts and technology</title><summary>The Thinning Veil—an unusual new play at UCSC featuring some of Greek tragedy’s most prominent characters—literally takes place in two different worlds.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, ucsc theater arts, Theater Arts Department, telematics, California theater, arts and technology</keywords><start-date>1329859200000</start-date><display-name>grand experiment’ in arts and technology</display-name><path>/2012/02/thinning-veil</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/02/thinning-veil</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1329858143007</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1331922077875</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Theater Arts</value><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/Thinning Veil-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/Thinning Veil-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Thinning Veil-300.jpg</name><display-name>Thinning Veil-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>33127</file-size><width>300</width><height>399</height></image><image-alt>image of woman behind thin veil</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/Th-veil-thumb-.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/Th-veil-thumb-.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Th-veil-thumb-.jpg</name><display-name>Th-veil-thumb-.jpg</display-name><file-size>20331</file-size><width>81</width><height>81</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Unusual classical play to be performed in separate ‘worlds’ linked by the Internet</article-subhead><article-text><p><strong>The Thinning Veil</strong>&#8212;a new play featuring some of Greek tragedy&#8217;s most prominent characters&#8212;literally takes place in two different worlds.<br/>
<br/>
Audience members will buy a ticket for either UCSC&#8217;s Experimental Theater or the Dark Lab in the campus&#8217;s&#160; Digital Arts and New Media Research Center.<br/>
<br/>
In each building, they will watch the live action in the theater where they are physically seated&#8212;as well as the action in the alternate location.<br/>
<br/>
Real-time internet connectivity will link the casts in both venues.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>&#8220;It&#8217;s very intricate,&#8221;</strong> said Theater Arts lecturer Kirsten Brandt, who wrote the play based on several classical Greek works, and is also directing the UCSC production.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;With six live cameras (three in each venue) we have the capacity for six separate images on six different screens, or any combination thereof,&#8221; she explained.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s a grand experiment in the intersection of arts and technology,&#8221; Brandt added.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Or as UCSC associate Theater Arts professor</strong> Ted Warburton put it:<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Watching Kirsten direct this play is like watching someone play chess in 3D: each move, each decision creates ripples across multiple dimensions of space and time.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Warburton, the producer of <em>The Thinning Veil</em>, is a dancer and choreographer who has himself experimented with &#8220;telematic&#8221; or distance performance.<br/>
<br/>
In 2005, he staged a Theater Arts production titled &#8220;Lubricious Transfer,&#8221; in which student dancers at UC Santa Cruz and New York University performed simultaneously-- interacting on projected screens through a live streaming connection.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Brandt&#8217;s new play is drawn</strong> from such Greek classics as <em>Electra</em> by Euripides, <em>The Oresteia</em> by Aeschylus, and <em>The Illiad</em> by Homer.<br/>
<br/>
It features Theater Arts associate professor Patty Gallagher as Clytemnestra, the embittered wife of Agamemnon, and the tortured mother of Electra, Orestes and their half-sister Erigone.<br/>
<br/>
Gallagher performed last year at UCSC in the Shakespeare Santa Cruz productions of <em>The Three Musketeers</em> and <em>Henry IV, Part 1</em>.<br/>

He was 79.</p>
<p>Collett, a professor emeritus of natural history, was a member of UCSC's founding faculty when the campus opened in 1965. As founding director of the Arboretum, he oversaw the conversion of about 130 acres of rough pastures into a leading horticultural site. The Arboretum is renowned for its collections of plants from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as California natives.</p>
<p>"Ray Collett left the campus, the community, and the world a living memorial, not only here in the wonderful collections of the UCSC Arboretum, but also in the many varieties of plants he helped introduce to California gardeners," said the Arboretum's current director, Brett Hall, who started working with Collett at the Arboretum in 1975 as a UCSC student.</p>
<p>Collett spent his last days at the Arboretum surrounded by the plant collections he helped establish. He was under hospice care in Hall's home on the Arboretum grounds.</p>
<p>Collett is credited with introducing many popular ornamental plants to the nursery industry. These include the 'Swan River' cultivar of the Australian "blue hibiscus" <em>(Alyogyne huegelii)</em> and the 'Hurricane Point' cultivar of the California fuchsia <em>(Epilobium canum).</em> He received several honors in recognition of his work, including the American Horticultural Society's 1986 Professional Citation, the California Horticultural Society's Annual Award for 1997, and the California Association of Nurserymen's 1997 Research Award.</p>
<p>Collett was also a popular teacher, mentoring students who worked at the Arboretum and teaching courses in art, botany, biogeography, horticulture, and meteorology. He gathered plants for the Arboretum that would be useful for both teaching and research. Among the unusual plants he added to the Arboretum's collection was <em>Amborella trichopoda,</em> collected in 1975 from the South Pacific island of New Caledonia by a pair of UCSC students. In 1999, when a genetic analysis identified <em>Amborella</em> as the most primitive living flowering plant, the UCSC Arboretum was the only botanic garden in the United States with living specimens of it.</p>
<p>"Ray Collett personified UCSC at its very best: vision, integrity, imagination, accomplishment," said Todd Newberry, professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology and a UCSC founding faculty member.</p>
<p>Collett earned his B.A. in chemistry and Ph.D. in geography from UC Berkeley. He worked at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the U.S. Weather Bureau before joining the UCSC faculty. He served as Arboretum director from 1965 through 1997.</p>

Led by scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the study was published in the journal <em>Coral Reefs</em> (<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/33542652n1402484/">online publication</a> January 28).</p>
<p>The researchers found that the loss of predatory fish leads to a cascade of effects throughout the reef ecosystem, starting with an explosion in sea urchin populations. Excessive grazing by sea urchins damages the reef structure and reduces the extent of a poorly studied but crucially important component of the reefs known as crustose coralline algae. Coralline algae deposit calcium carbonate in their cell walls and form a hard crust on the substrates where they grow, helping to build and stabilize reefs. They also play a crucial role in the life cycle of corals.</p>
<p>"Some coralline algae produce a chemical that induces coral settlement, in which the larval stage in the water settles on the ocean floor to grow into an adult. This settlement must happen for reefs to recover after disturbance," said lead author Jennifer O'Leary, a research associate with the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The ability of coralline algae to induce the settlement of coral larvae has been well studied in the laboratory, but few studies have been done to investigate this relationship in the field. O'Leary set out to study the role of coralline algae in reef ecosystems as a UCSC graduate student working with Donald Potts, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and a coauthor of the paper.&#160;</p>
<p>In Kenya, O'Leary teamed up with Tim McClanahan, a UCSC alumnus who now heads the Wildlife Conservation Society's marine programs in Kenya. The researchers compared the types of coralline algae and the number of juvenile corals on Kenyan reefs under three different management conditions: closed, gear-restricted, and open access. On fished reefs (both those open to all fishing and those with gear restrictions), sea urchin populations were much higher than on closed reefs, resulting in lower abundance of crustose coralline algae and lower coral densities.</p>
<p>"Outside the protected areas, we're seeing the ecosystem collapse," O'Leary said. "When you look at the effects of fishing, you can't just think about the species that are being removed. You have to look at how the effects are carried down through the ecosystem."</p>
<p>Most of the young corals found in the surveys were growing on crustose coralline algae. Juveniles of four common coral families were more abundant on coralline algae than on any other settlement substrate. The results suggest that fishing can indirectly reduce coral recruitment or the success of juvenile corals by reducing the abundance of settlement-inducing coralline algae.</p>
<p>"The loss of crustose coralline algae has huge implications for regeneration of coral reefs," O'Leary said. "In our surveys, we found no difference between gear-restricted areas and fully fished areas, so gear restrictions are not working to keep urchin populations down. We need to consider ecosystem-wide effects as we develop new management strategies."</p>
<p>Potts said he hopes the new study will raise awareness of the role that coralline algae play in the health of coral reefs, especially in developing countries. "Most managers and conservationists, and even many scientists, are unaware of the existence, abundance, and importance of coralline algae, so management regimes intended to enhance the health of reefs may actually be detrimental," he said.</p>
<p>The coauthors of the paper include O'Leary, Potts, McClanahan, and Juan Carlos Braga of the University of Granada, Spain. Funding for this research was provided by UC Santa Cruz, Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation, ARCS Foundation, Project Aware, and Wildlife Conservation Society.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bfcf6c888072704601de65368dcf47fb"><name>grb-ag-march-01</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>March 1 Day of Action</title><summary>Chancellor Blumenthal and CP/EVC Galloway ask students, faculty, and staff to monitor developments on March 1, a Day of Action in support of public education.</summary><keywords>march 1, protest, traffic, access, empire grade, advocacy, day of action, demonstration</keywords><start-date>1330333200000</start-date><display-name>grb-ag-march-01</display-name><path>/2012/02/grb-ag-march-01</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/02/grb-ag-march-01</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1330362936347</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1330460193298</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>College students across the country are calling for a Day of Action in support of public education on Thursday, March 1. We anticipate that UCSC students and other members of our campus community will participate in protest activities, including rallies at the main entrance to campus that will likely impact the flow of traffic onto campus.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
We respect that students, instructors, and staff know more about the impact of budget cuts than anyone else, as they have borne the impact of fee hikes, course reductions, and layoffs. We wholeheartedly support advocacy in support of education. However, we take issue with a protest that simultaneously denies students access to those classes for which they have paid.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
It is our expectation that participants will remain respectful of the needs of the broader campus community and that the day will unfold in a safe and positive manner. In particular, emergency vehicles must be allowed to respond, not only to the campus but also along Empire Grade, a key artery for neighboring communities.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Given the likelihood of disruptions to at least some campus operations on Thursday, we encourage students to talk with their instructors in advance about access to classrooms on March 1. Similarly, staff are asked to check in with supervisors and managers about possible changes in work plans that day. It is imperative that students, staff, and faculty monitor developments throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
Before coming to campus on Thursday, please check the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/03/protest/">March 1</a> web site, where the Public Affairs Office will post information and updates. The campus's communication hotline (459-INFO) will be activated early in the morning, and KZSC Radio (88.1 FM) will broadcast news and information on an as-needed basis. We will also share information via <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ucsc">UCSC's Twitter account</a>. Finally, if you haven't done so already, please make sure your contact information is current in <a href="http://emergency.ucsc.edu/cruzalert/cruzalert-emergency-notification-system">CruzAlert</a>, the campus's phone-based emergency notification system.<br/>
<br/>
As March 1 approaches, we believe that legislators in Sacramento remain the audience that most needs to hear the call for greater state investment in public higher education. The UC Student Association is sponsoring a <a href="http://ucforcalifornia.org/uc4ca/home/">day of advocacy</a> in Sacramento on March 5. Our elected officials have the power to reverse the cascade of cuts that have jeopardized UC's ability to deliver a high-quality, affordable education.</p>

Para: Profesorado y Personal de la Universidad de California, Santa Cruz<br/>
De parte de: Chancellor Blumenthal y Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway<br/>
Sobre: D&#237;a de acci&#243;n, el jueves 1ero. de marzo<br/>
<br/>
Los y las estudiantes universitarios/as en todo el pa&#237;s han llamado a un D&#237;a de acci&#243;n en apoyo de la educaci&#243;n p&#250;blica, para el jueves, primero de marzo. Preveemos que los/as estudiantes y otros miembros de la comunidad de nuestro campus van a participar en las actividades de protesta, incluyendo las reuniones y los actos ha realizarse en la entrada principal del campus, que posiblemente van a tener un impacto en la circulaci&#243;n del tr&#225;fico al campus.<br/>
<br/>
Comprendemos que los/as estudiantes, profesores y profesoras y el personal saben m&#225;s que nadie del impacto de los recortes presupuestarios, ya que ellos y ellas han sufrido el impacto del aumento de los aranceles, reducciones de cursos y despidos. Apoyamos plenamente los esfuerzos en defensa de la educaci&#243;n. Sin embargo, no estamos de acuerdo con una protesta que simult&#225;neamente impide a los/as estudiantes acceso a las clases por las cuales han pagado.<br/>
<br/>
Es nuestra esperanza que los y las participantes respetar&#225;n las necesidades de toda la comunidad del campus y que el d&#237;a se desarrollar&#225; de una manera positiva y segura. Especialmente, a los veh&#237;culos de emergencia se les debe permitir responder, no solamente en el per&#237;metro del campus, pero tambi&#233;n a lo largo de Empire Grade, una arteria muy importante para las comunidades vecinas.<br/>
<br/>
Dada la probabilidad de interrupciones de al menos algunas de las operaciones del campus, les pedimos a los/as estudiantes que hablen por adelantado con sus instructores/as sobre el acceso a las aulas el jueves primero de marzo. De la misma manera, se les pide al personal que hablen con sus supervisores/as y encargados/as de unidad sobre posibles cambios en los planes de trabajo para el jueves. Es absolutamente necesario que los/as estudiantes, el personal y el profesorado est&#233;n al tanto del desarrollo de los acontecimientos durante todo el d&#237;a.<br/>
<br/>
Antes de venir al campus el jueves, por favor f&#237;jense en el sitio web del primero de marzo: <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/03/protest/">March 1</a>, en el cual la Oficina de Asuntos P&#250;blicos pondr&#225; informaci&#243;n y actualizaciones. La l&#237;nea directa de comunicaci&#243;n del campus (459-INFO) ser&#225; activada temprano en la ma&#241;ana del jueves y la estaci&#243;n de radio KZSC (88.1 FM) transmitir&#225; noticias e informaci&#243;n siempre que sea necesario. Tambi&#233;n compartiremos informaci&#243;n por medio de <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ucsc">UCSC&#8217;s Twitter account</a>. Por &#250;ltimo, si no lo han hecho todav&#237;a, por favor aseg&#250;rense de que su informaci&#243;n est&#225; actualizada en <a href="http://emergency.ucsc.edu/cruzalert/cruzalert-emergency-notification-system">CruzAlert</a>, el sistema telef&#243;nico de notificaci&#243;n de emergencia del campus.<br/>
<br/>
A medida que nos aproximamos al primero de marzo, creemos que los/as legisladores/as en Sacramento constituyen la audiencia que m&#225;s necesita escuchar el llamado por una inversi&#243;n estatal m&#225;s grande en la educaci&#243;n p&#250;blica superior. La Asociaci&#243;n de Estudiantes de la Universidad de California (the UC Student Association) va a auspiciar un <a href="http://ucforcalifornia.org/uc4ca/home/">day of advocacy</a> (un d&#237;a de apoyo, defensa y promoci&#243;n de la educaci&#243;n) en Sacramento, el 5 de marzo. Nuestros funcionarios electos tienen el poder de revertir la cascada de recortes que han puesto en peligro la capacidad de la Universidad de California para ofrecer una educaci&#243;n accesible y de alta calidad.&#160;<br/>

<br/>
Lanfranco is now a professional artist living in Brooklyn.&#160; She is represented by the Nancy Hoffman Gallery, and currently teaches at the Museum of Modern Art, LIM College, and Fordham University in New York City. <br/>
<br/>
This winter quarter, Lanfranco returned to Santa Cruz to work with 10 students from UCSC&#8217;s <em>Art</em> and <em>History of Art and Visual Culture</em> departments to create an ambitious exhibition at Porter College&#8217;s Sesnon Gallery. <br/>
<br/>
As Sesnon Gallery director Shelby Graham describes it: &#8220;We had a living and breathing studio experience; we turned the gallery into a student workshop.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The UCSC alumna worked</strong> with Graham and the students to create <em>Natural Selection</em>, a large-scale, hand-cut paper installation created specifically for the Sesnon Gallery space. <br/>
<br/>
This imagined landscape of hand-cut trees was inspired by both the surrounding forests of the extraordinary UCSC campus, and Lanfranco&#8217;s recent six-month residency in Kyoto, Japan on a National Endowment of the Arts creative fellowship.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Throughout the construction</strong> of the project, Lanfranco shared with students personal anecdotes, experiences, and real-life challenges she has faced as a professional artist working in New York.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s partially sharing information, and partly debunking myths,&#8221; says Lanfranco. &#8220;Things like studio practices&#8212;you might assume that professional artists have clear plans mapped out from the beginning.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Or it&#8217;s challenging the myth of the solitary genius artist,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Art can be a collaborative experience, you don&#8217;t have to look so far for inspiration or engagement.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I think sometimes people are afraid of pursuing art,&#8221; Lanfranco observed. &#8220;So I try to lessen that fear by sharing my own processes&#8212;keeping the thrill, but taking the fear and mystery out of it.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>When she first flew in from New York</strong>, Lanfranco asked the groundskeeper at Porter College for a tour of the trees around the college, which influenced the design of the project. <br/>
<br/>
Responding to the environment, she then had the student apprentices do research and study technical aspects of the project to get them inspired and help them understand the artistic process.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I really see it as a reciprocal experience,&#8221; said Lanfranco. &#8220;The more I feel the generosity of the students, the more I want to give back. It&#8217;s been a really great experience.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The students seemed to unanimously agree.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>&#8220;Her work ethic is inspiring,&#8221;</strong> said Heidi Cramer, a 26-year-old junior who transferred to UCSC from Arizona to study art. &#8220;I had a lot of expectations for this project, and they&#8217;ve been surpassed.&#8221; <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s made a world of difference to a mixed media artist like myself&#8230;learning new skills&#8212;how to do an installation, what an artist does with their time all day, how to communicate--these are all things I can apply to my career,&#8221; she added.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Leia Delabahan, a 20-year-old senior</strong>, noted that working on the exhibition was a tremendous opportunity for her as a student.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s been very rewarding&#8212;to be able to work with an artist who has made it professionally, and who went to the same school as you did,&#8221; said Delabahan. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I had this particular image in my mind of a New York artist before this exhibition. But since I worked with Katerina, I&#8217;ve realized that you can live a busy, hectic artist&#8217;s lifestyle in New York City and still be a very real, down-to-earth person.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Plus this project gave me hands-on experience that I would not be able to get in a regular classroom,&#8221; added Delabahan. &#8220;This is exactly what I want to do after college.&#8221; <br/>
<br/>
<strong>For alumna Lanfranco,</strong> the experience was rejuvenating. <br/>
<br/>
She said she really enjoyed being on campus again and made the most of her brief residency, happy to find UCSC students still really curious, open minded, and engaged.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I think of my time at UCSC as extremely nurturing,&#8221; said Lanfranco. &#8220;It&#8217;s surprising that coming back 10 years later, it&#8217;s still nurturing--in a completely different way. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;With the generosity and engagement of the students, the totally welcoming arms of the Art Department and professors, the support of Sesnon director Shelby Graham&#8212;it&#8217;s almost like a family reunion.&#8221;<br/>

munch</image-alt><image-caption>Stephan Munch</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Two scientists affiliated with the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) at UC Santa Cruz have been awarded 2012 Pew Fellowships in Marine Conservation. Michael Beck, lead scientist of the global marine team at the Nature Conservancy, and Stephan Munch, a fisheries ecologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), are both IMS research associates.</p>
<p>The Pew Fellows Program in Marine Conservation is a prestigious program that gives recipients $150,000 for a three-year scientific research or conservation project designed to address critical challenges facing our oceans. Munch will develop tools that predict changes in fish population demographics in response to climate change. Beck's project seeks to promote "green infrastructure" as a strategy for adapting to climate change and to support ecosystem recovery to help make communities less vulnerable to current coastal hazards.&#160;</p>
<p>"With the support of the Pew Marine Fellowship, I will be able to show through research and tools that ecosystem restoration is an effective option for hazard mitigation and climate adaptation," Beck said.</p>
<p>The fellowship will allow Beck to pursue the advantages of green infrastructure, such as wetlands and coral reefs, over traditional or "gray" infrastructure, such as sea walls and jetties. His work will include developing tools to help decision makers address coastal risks from climate change and directing resources toward green infrastructure solutions, with a specific focus on tropical nations.</p>
<p>Increasingly, governments are allocating funds for the development of gray infrastructure that attempts to stop sea level rise or storm surges. These structures harm many of the same coastal systems that provide protection. Beck's project will advance ecosystem-based adaptation, both to shield coastal communities and to conserve the natural environment. "I hope that my project will increase decision makers' awareness and managers' use of coastal habitats to protect against climate change impacts," he said.</p>
<p>Munch's fellowship project will develop, validate, and apply statistical methods for forecasting climate-driven changes in fish populations. By experimenting with fish in the laboratory, he will also examine the effects of temperature on fish maturation rates and other traits that affect population size. His efforts will result in a free online tool for predicting these population responses and will make the information available to management bodies and the scientific community.</p>
<p>"The Pew Marine Fellowship will allow me to conduct important research needed to increase our understanding of how organisms and ecosystems in the ocean will react to climate change," Munch said. "These ecological responses will affect not only the characteristics of fish populations, but also the diversity of natural systems and economic productivity of global fisheries."</p>
<p>Characteristics of animals such as population growth rate and lifespan greatly affect the design of conservation and management plans. All of these are affected by climate, which is projected to change substantially in the next 50 years, with significant increases in global mean temperature. Munch's research will result in a large-scale view of the impact of these changes on fisheries, including responses of species for which there is now little relevant data.</p>
<p>The Pew Fellows Program in Marine Conservation has awarded 125 fellowships to recipients from 32 countries. The Pew Marine Fellowships fund science and other projects that address critical challenges in the conservation of the oceans. The program is managed by the Pew Environment Group, based in Washington, D.C. The Pew Environment Group is the conservation arm of The Pew Charitable Trusts.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c55403028072704601a8f518de95dcb2"><name>transportation-advisory</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Transportation Advisory</title><summary>This advisory is provided to remind members of the UCSC community of the possibility of traffic disruptions on or near campus on Thursday, March 1.</summary><start-date>1330419600000</start-date><display-name>Transportation Advisory</display-name><path>/2012/02/transportation-advisory</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/02/transportation-advisory</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1330455511563</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1330455511563</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>

<p>Blumenthal, Galloway, Academic Senate chair Susan Gillman, and Staff Advisory Board chair John Steele also discussed ways to advocate for the university.</p>
<p>While Galloway expressed concern that the "rough ride is not over," she also provided some words of encouragement. "I want you to leave here today knowing that in spite of all the budget cuts, this is still an amazing place," Galloway said. "Faculty and staff have rallied together &#8230; We have to think creatively and hold on tightly and dearly to the things we cherish on campus. This is the time to be an advocate for higher education."</p>
<p>In the past four years, UCSC&#8217;s budget has been reduced by $49 million. Since 2008, the total number of faculty and staff employees has been reduced by 17 percent. Staff levels have been reduced 21 percent.</p>
<p>The number of undergraduate classes with a size of more than 100 students has increased by 33.3 percent, while the percentage of classes with fewer than 20 students has diminished by 25.7 percent.</p>
<p>The unknown fate of several proposed state ballot initiatives makes 2012-13 budget planning in the UC system and on this campus very challenging, Galloway said. Under one relatively &#8220;optimistic&#8221; scenario, the UC system will still have to withstand a $100 million &#8216;trigger cut&#8217; that would include a $4.5 million reduction to UCSC.&#160;</p>
<p>However, if a tax initiative that could offset deeper cuts does not make it to the ballot, or is not approved by voters, the UC system could face a $200 million cut including a much larger reduction to UCSC&#8217;s budget.</p>
<p>In light of this uncertainty, Blumenthal appealed to audience members, asking them to bring their concerns straight to the state Legislature.</p>
<p>"We should not lose sight of the bigger picture," Blumenthal said, referring to the &#8220;long-term degradation&#8221; of state support since 1991.</p>
<p>The speakers encouraged students in the audience to be outspoken in their support of UCSC and for access to education. Blumenthal urged young scholars to direct their concerns to the state government and to the voters of California.</p>
<p>Galloway said students would be most effective if they provided stories and specifics about their concerns to the Legislature.</p>
<p>"Legislators really like anecdotes about why your education is important and how it is being hurt," she said. "Those are stories they need to hear directly from students. We also need to hear from alumni on why their college experience was so important."</p>
<p>&#160;The budget presentation was recorded and will be presented on the campus's <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget-update/">Budget Update web site</a>.

<p>Fan worked as an engineer on the UCSC Genome Browser project from 2002 to 2012&#8212;his 10th anniversary would have been on February 27. His notable accomplishments include the UCSC Proteome Browser, the early versions of the widely used UCSC Genes annotation set for the human and mouse genomes, and his browser support for several medically oriented projects, including the HIV vaccine database project for Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases and early CBSE work on cancer genomics. Fan was passionate about his work on the browser project and the overall mission of the CBSE. He strongly believed in the group's ability to make a difference in the fields of cancer genomics and personalized medicine and was very proud to have the privilege to be a part of a project that so profoundly impacts science. Even after Fan became ill, he continued to contribute to the browser project and to urge the team to pursue opportunities to expand its influence in the areas of medical and cancer genomics.</p>
<p>Fan spent the early years of his life in Taiwan, where he studied nuclear engineering at National Tsing Hua University. After completing his mandatory military service, he received a scholarship from the School of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue University, where he earned both an MS and a PhD. Fan then moved to California with his wife, Millie, and embarked on a successful career in the science and technology industry.</p>
<p>Fan was an exceptionally devoted husband to his wife and a loving father to his son, Ray, both of Cupertino, CA. His boundless optimism and his perpetual cheerfulness brought joy and happiness into the lives of his family, friends, and colleagues. Fan strongly believed in the motto, &#8220;It takes a difference to make a difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his final months of life, he developed a concept he called &#8220;<a href="http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/%7Edonnak/Bank_of_Caring/Bank_of_Caring.doc">Bank of Caring</a>," in which a chain of caring is established between those who provide help to others and recipients of the caring acts, who then have the moral obligation to help at least two more people. Fan believed that widespread adoption of this concept could make the world a better place.</p>
In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that people do something to support Fan&#8217;s Bank of Caring idea, either through personal actions or by supporting an organization that promotes the chain of caring idea. Some international organizations that support this concept are <a href="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a>, <a href="http://www.heifer.org/">Heifer International</a>, and <a href="http://www.pifexperience.org/">Pay It Forward</a>; local organizations include the <a href="http://www.scapsite.org/">Santa Cruz AIDS project</a>, <a href="http://www.scvolunteercenter.com/programs/youth/youth-serve/">YouthServe</a>, and <a href="http://www.womencaresantacruz.org/">WomenCare</a>.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>David Haussler, Director, Center for Biomolecular Science &amp; Engineering, and Professor, Biomolecular Engineering</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c62ee9918072704601a8f518f494b0e4"><name>scholarship-benefit-gala-2012</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scholarship Benefit Dinner highlights innovation, looks  toward the future</title><summary>A crowd of 400 turned out for the ninth annual UC Santa Cruz Scholarship Benefit Dinner that took place Saturday night at the Fairmont in downtown San Jose with the theme of 'Taking on the Future.'</summary><start-date>1330419600000</start-date><display-name>Scholarship Benefit Dinner 2012</display-name><path>/2012/02/scholarship-benefit-gala-2012</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/02/scholarship-benefit-gala-2012</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1330469857437</created-on><last-modified-by>jrburns</last-modified-by><last-modified>1330551423085</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/sbd1350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/sbd1350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sbd1350.jpg</name><display-name>sbd1350.jpg</display-name><file-size>24741</file-size><width>350</width><height>217</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/sbdthumb80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/sbdthumb80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sbdthumb80.jpg</name><display-name>sbdthumb80.jpg</display-name><file-size>14644</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Susan Wojcicki (M.S. applied economics, &#8217;93), senior vice president, advertising, for Google, delivered a speech and multimedia presentation charting the rise of her company starting with the days when its cofounders began it as a fledgling operation in her garage.

<p>One of UCSC's signature events, the dinner provides support for undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships in an effort to help students attain their fullest academic potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tonight is about how to prepare our students for accomplishment and innovation,&#8221; said UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p>
<p>More students than ever now need financial assistance to attend the university, and in recent years, low- and middle-income families have been particularly hard-hit by increased costs.</p>
<p>Due to the reduction in state support for the University of California, UC fees for an undergraduate California resident are approximately $12,192 for 2011-12. More than two-thirds of UC undergraduates received some form of financial assistance in the past academic year.</p>
<p>During the gala dinner, the audience listened with rapt attention as Susan Wojcicki (M.S. applied economics, &#8217;93), senior vice president, advertising, for Google, delivered a speech and multimedia presentation charting the rise of her company starting with the days when cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin began it as a fledgling operation in her garage, which they were renting at the time. Wojckicki later became Google&#8217;s 16th hire.</p>
<p>The audience cheered and gave a standing ovation for alumnus Bill Dickinson, founder of the Smith Renaissance Society at UCSC. Dickinson received the UC Santa Cruz Foundation&#8217;s Fiat Lux Award for his outstanding commitment to independent students at UCSC&#8212;those who are homeless, foster or runaway youths, orphans, or wards of the court.</p>
<p>Before the ceremony, walking through the corridors of the Fairmont was like taking a stroll through all phases of UCSC history. In one corner, Harold &#8220;Hal&#8221; Hyde&#8212;UCSC's first vice chancellor of business and finance and last year's recipient of the Fiat Lux award, greeted well-wishers.</p>
<p>Across the concourse, Tan Ha and Gabi Kirk of the Campus Sustainability Internship Program were on hand to talk to guests about green initiatives on campus while UCSC&#8217;s newly selected alumni Regent Ken Feingold introduced himself to guests. Staff and students told guests about Project Awesome, a project to advance women&#8217;s education at the School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Before long, Cloud 9 A Cappella ushered guests into the Regency ballroom with their performance of a Jackie Wilson tune in the foyer, which they followed up on stage with a human beat-box-driven doo-wop take on &#8220;What a Wonderful World,&#8221; a song made famous by Louis Armstrong.</p>
<p>The audience took in presentations that ranged from the cutting edge of the information technology world to a program that provides confidence and academic success for independent students.</p>
<p>Susan Wojcicki provided a good illustration for the evening&#8217;s &#8220;Taking on the Future&#8221; theme. A key member of the Google startup team, she now leads the design, innovation, and engineering of all of Google's advertising products&#8212;accounting for 96 percent of the company's revenue. She joined Google in 1999 as its first marketing manager and worked on its original marketing programs.</p>
<p>Wojcicki, who earned her undergraduate degree from Harvard University, also led the initial development of several key successful consumer products including Google Images, Google Books, and Google Video.</p>
<p>Her presentation ranged from emotionally stirring to hilarious. Referencing the urgency of fundraising for student scholarships, she said, &#8220;I feel like it&#8217;s not that long ago (when) I was a UCSC student on a scholarship. I haven&#8217;t changed that much since then&#8212;but the world has changed. When I graduated in 1993, the Internet was still a government research project.... When I was at UCSC I couldn&#8217;t upload pictures, look at posts, and figure out which friends were hanging out at the Saturn Caf&#233;,&#8221; she added, referring to Santa Cruz&#8217;s famous vegetarian diner.</p>
<p>Now the Internet has more than 2 billion users across the globe.</p>
<p>To illustrate the far-ranging power of information technology she provided visual examples&#8212;ranging from&#160; a Twitter post that played a role in the Arab Spring to Rebecca Black&#8217;s (in)famous pop-song video, &#8220;Friday&#8221;&#8212;which received some 200 million hits, with 86 percent dislikes. She took audience members on a ride through UCSC using images from Google Maps with Street View and shared stunning footage showing the Google Driverless Car Project.</p>
<p>Bill Dickinson received loud applause after his emotional address to the crowd. His address included warm remarks about Page and Eloise Smith, his mentors at UCSC, commemorated in the name of the Smith Renaissance Society.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel abiding gratitude,&#8221; Dickinson said. &#8220;First, I am grateful for Page Smith, our founding (Cowell College) provost, whose name we bear and whose necktie I am honored to wear. The first and last man I saw ride a horse on campus, Page stood tall in the saddle, embodying virtues and values young people could grasp easily&#8212;especially the love and respect he lavished on students regardless of status. I am grateful for his fiercely spunky wife, Eloise, an artist who showed that if you want to see something good happen just do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am grateful for the community of friends&#8212;volunteers inside and outside the university, mentors, and donors&#8212;whose big-hearted devotion makes the Smith Renaissance Society possible,&#8221; Dickinson said. "This award goes to all of us. I am grateful to our students, past and present, who showed up tonight: you are our reason for being, our hope for the future.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ca49ad878072704600b8359b16dbd0da"><name>earth-summit</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz hosts 11th annual Earth Summit</title><summary>On Saturday, March 3, the Student Environmental Center will host the 11th Annual Campus Earth Summit from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the College Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room.</summary><keywords>earth summit</keywords><start-date>1330506000000</start-date><display-name>11th annual Earth Summit</display-name><path>/2012/02/earth-summit</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/02/earth-summit</link><created-by>jrburns</created-by><created-on>1330538720561</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1331147199949</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Eliza Milio, (626) 622-0997, emilio@ucsc.edu; Camila Bobroff, (858) 382-4227, cbobroff@ucsc.edu</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/earth-summit.400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/earth-summit.400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>earth-summit.400.jpg</name><display-name>earth-summit.400.jpg</display-name><file-size>279510</file-size><width>400</width><height>618</height></image><image-alt>Earth Summit poster</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/02/images/earth-summit.72.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/02/images/earth-summit.72.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>earth-summit.72.jpg</name><display-name>earth-summit.72.jpg</display-name><file-size>24961</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Earth Summit poster</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>On Saturday, March 3, the Student Environmental Center will host the 11th Annual Campus <a href="http://sec.enviroslug.org/earth-summit.html">Earth Summit</a> from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the College Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room on the UC Santa Cruz campus.
