<p>Growing up to 12 feet in height, the perennial shrub with its bright yellow flowers had overrun land once filled with Douglas fir. But what was most interesting to Thompson was the fact that, even if all the Scotch Broom were removed, the Douglas fir would most likely not regrow.</p>
<p>Thanks to a grant from UC Santa Cruz's Dean's Fund for Undergraduate Research and to Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Ingrid Parker, Thompson (Cowell '15, plant sciences) spent a year doing research into the question of why the Scotch Broom was so toxic to Douglas fir.</p>
<p>Thompson's work also was emblematic of a UC Santa Cruz ethos grounded in the founding days of the university: the opportunity for undergraduates to take part in research. In fact, a 2014 study conducted by the university found 73 percent of graduating seniors had assisted in faculty research or creative projects during their time at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Thompson's research project was time-consuming. First she grew Scotch Broom and Douglas fir seedlings in a campus greenhouse and then isolated the mycorrhizal fungi that give nutrients to plants' roots, including Douglas fir. She sequenced the fungi's DNA, extracted allelopathic chemicals from the Scotch Broom that are released into the soil, and then documented their effect on the different fungi.</p>
<p>It turned out the alkaloids from Scotch Broom inhibited the growth of most of the crucial fungi. Only a few types seemed able to tolerate it.</p>
<p>"Jennifer's research is remarkable in the way it bridges very different fields," said professor Parker. "She has done everything from fieldwork in Washington, to the extraction and HPLC analysis of the chemical compounds in her plants, to the isolation and culturing of mycorrhizal fungi, to the DNA sequencing of those fungi."</p>
<p>Thompson's results, Parker said, "may explain why we see very poor survival of Douglas fir seedlings in areas that are invaded by the shrub."</p>
<p>For Thompson, the research project was creative and rewarding.</p>
<p>The creative part, she said, was designing an experiment that would answer an important question. The reward was discovering something that may help restoration efforts.</p>
<p>Someday, Thompson speculated, mycorrhizal fungi might be inoculated back into the soil, setting the stage for Douglas fir forests to rise again.</p>
<p>"I like it when research like this has an application," she said.</p>
<p>After graduation this summer, Thompson, who had planned to go into medicine until she started working at one of UC Santa Cruz's greenhouses and discovered a passion for plants, is headed to Panama to intern at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.</p>
<p>This will be her third time at the research institute, including a field course with UC Santa Cruz Professor of Environmental Studies Gregory Gilbert that led her to an interest in plant fungal ecology and the idea of going to graduate school.</p>
<p>Tromping through forest and jungle, peering through microscopes, and writing her results gave a new dimension to Thompson's college years.</p>
<p>"Coming into college, I didn't think I could do any of this," Thompson said. "It gave me more confidence. I feel more confident about my future because of it."</p>

<h3>Why do you volunteer with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>I volunteer because, like most of us, I have an inexplicable heart-connection to Santa Cruz. Choosing to go to UC Santa Cruz was one of the best decisions of my life. Plus, I love connecting people. And Slugs are some of the best people in the world!</p>
<h3>What types of things do you do as a Slug volunteer?</h3>
<p>I plan and host fun and meaningful events in the Bay Area that all types of Slugs would enjoy. My pride and joy is our annual UC Santa Cruz Day at the Oakland A's (let's go OAKLAND!).</p>
<h3>What has been the most rewarding thing about volunteering with your alma mater?</h3>
<p>Simply providing a space for Slugs to interact, converse, laugh, and learn with each other. I know it's been a successful day when alumni ask for more.</p>
<h3>Words of advice for those thinking of volunteering with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>Think about what drives you to volunteer and why you want to reconnect with UC Santa Cruz. From academia to socializing to cultural history, so many of our events were sparked by alumni who expressed their strong interests. That's where our best ideas come from.</p>
<h3>What's your best memory from your time at UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>Whether I was on Main Stage, the Barn Theater, or in Porter Dining Hall, my best memories happened while rehearsing and performing with my friends. That camaraderie and playfulness was very special.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b03ef395807270172b238cce3f0d9d1b"><name>in-memoriam-robert-durling</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Robert Durling</title><summary>Robert M.

Durling, professor emeritus of Italian and English Literature at UC Santa Cruz, died May 21 in Oakland, Ca. He was 86.</p>
<div>Born March 11, 1929,in New York, Durling graduated from Manhasset High School in 1946. He attended Harvard College, graduating in 1950, and in 1958 earned a Ph.D. in comparative literature from <span class="MicrositeKeyword">Harvard University</span>, where he studied Dante with Charles S. Singleton. Durling taught briefly at Haverford College (1954-56) before going to the Department of Romance Languages at Cornell University in 1957.</div>
<div><br/>
 Durling's experience in the intellectually lively Cornell of the early '60s yielded <em>The Figure of the Poet in Renaissance Epic</em> (Harvard University Press, 1965), a study of the inscribed figure of the author in early modern texts both English and Italian. The book's chapter on Ariosto's Orlando Furioso details how Ariosto's poem engaged the crises of 16th century Italy, and helped to free Ariosto studies from the influence of Benedetto Croce, sparking subsequent scholarship.</div>
<div><br/>
 In 1966, Durling joined the literature department of the newly founded University of California, Santa Cruz. He was, in addition, a visiting professor at <span class="MicrositeKeyword">Princeton University</span>, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and the University of Oregon. His scholarly work focused closely on Italian literature of the 14th century, and his Petrarch's <em>Lyric Poems: the Rime Sparse and Other Lyrics</em> (Harvard, 1976), accompanied by Durling's prose translations, remains a standard reference for English-speaking students. In 1990, Durling, with Ronald L. Martinez, published <em>Time and the Crystal: Studies in Dante's 'Rime petrose'</em> (University of California Press), which claims that the formal principles of Dante's four petrose poems are analogous to the structures of the cosmos, and thus display a "microcosmic poetics" that subsequently informs the Divine Comedy.</div>
<div><br/>
 Durling's work on Dante culminated with his prose translation &#8211; first achieved in a single six-week stretch in 1993 &#8211; of the entire Divine Comedy and his subsequent commentary and notes on the poem, done in collaboration with Martinez. Oxford University Press published <em>Inferno</em> in 1996, <em>Purgatorio</em> in 2003, and <em>Paradiso</em> in 2011. In 2013, Durling's Paradiso translation was recognized by the Modern Language Association with the Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for a translation of a literary work.</div>
<div><br/>
 Endowed with unbounded curiosity, Durling was equally at ease in Italian, French, and German. He was a demanding but generous teacher and scholar, and a musician. He played the bassoon for many years, and occasionally turned his hand to composition: his "Study for String Orchestra" was performed in 1971; his waltz, "La Maussade," was recorded by the Baguette Quartette in 1998.</div>
<div><br/>
 He is survived by his wife of 30 years, Nancy Vine Durling; three daughters by a previous marriage to Rita J. Kuhn: Rachel Durling, husband Michael Papciak, Berkeley, Ca.; Sarah Durling, husband Yonatan Shemmer, Sheffield, England; Ruth and Daniel Wiseman, Passaic, N.J., and five grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his son Kenneth Durling.</div>
<p>A memorial service will be scheduled in Berkeley in August.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Sanjin Mehic's parents left everything behind when they fled the genocide, mass rapes, and repeated shellings of war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina for the quieter streets of San Jose, Calif.</p>
<p>His father, a businessman and economist, got a job painting cars in an auto body shop. His mother studied English and found work as an account manager in the biotech industry.</p>
<p>"My parents worked hard to get going and never looked back," said Mehic (Porter '16, biochemistry and molecular biology).</p>
<p>For Mehic, 24, that industriousness shaped his own life. Besides regular classes and schoolwork at UC Santa Cruz, Mehic is engaged in a research study that focuses on the role of bacteria in the production of an algal toxin called domoic acid in the Monterey Bay. Domoic acid not only kills marine organisms but also can cause neurological damage, sometimes fatal, in humans.</p>
<p>"I basically live inside the lab," Mehic said, with a laugh. "People ask me where's my sleeping bag."</p>
<p>Early on, Mehic didn't care much for school, but a community college pre-nursing course in organic chemistry changed that view.</p>
<p>"My brain and science just clicked," he said.</p>
<p>His interest landed him a summer research internship for community college students at UC Santa Cruz and eventually a place in the lab run by Assistant Professor of Ocean Sciences Marilou Sison-Mangus.</p>
<p>Thanks to Sison-Mangus and a grant from the Dean's Fund for Undergraduate Research, Mehic is engaged in a study to determine whether certain bacteria influence production of domoic acid during algal blooms.</p>
<p>"Sanjin has an intense passion about the research that he does, be it in the realm of microbiology, chemistry, or molecular biology," Sison-Mangus said. "He volunteers and involves himself in many research activities in my lab. He never leaves a question unanswered, and he does not limit himself to what he can do."</p>
<p>For Mehic's part, scientific research is creative, exciting, and leaves a lot of room for self-motivation. He said he came into UC Santa Cruz with five years of community college experience but that working in the lab not only taught him to think critically but also allowed him to share knowledge with a community of scientists. Eventually, he said, he'd like to get his Ph.D.</p>
<p>Sison-Mangus sees undergraduate research as "a venue for cultivating a student's confidence and maturity." Under the watch of experienced supervisors, she said, "they grow and learn how to be independent thinkers and doers. Doing research is not only about gathering data but also analyzing, writing, and presenting it to peers.</p>
<p>"Undergraduate research hones students in many ways and makes them well-prepared for outside challenges once they graduate from the university," she said.</p>
<p>In fact, a 2014 UC Santa Cruz study showed, 78 percent of graduating seniors reported that learning research methods was important to them as part of their educational experience.</p>
<p>For Mehic, the ability to pursue undergraduate research gave him an avenue for his passion.</p>
"Once you find the thing you love to do," he said, "it's hard to separate yourself from it."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2015/06/sleuthing-killer-shrub</path><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2015/06/sleuthing-killer-shrub</link><site>news</site><name>sleuthing-killer-shrub</name><display-name>Sleuthing a killer shrub </display-name><title>Sleuthing a killer shrub </title><summary>Students like Jennifer Thompson—who researched why Scotch Broom is toxic to Douglas fir—take advantage of a unique opportunity at UC Santa Cruz: the ability to do research as an undergraduate.</summary><keywords>Douglas fir, Scotch Broom, Jennifer Thompson</keywords><start-date>Jun 2, 2015 12:00 AM</start-date></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title>Sleuthing a killer shrub</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/mehic-sanjin-originals.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/mehic-sanjin-originals.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mehic-sanjin-originals.jpg</name><display-name>mehic-sanjin-originals.jpg</display-name><file-size>13782</file-size><width>295</width><height>160</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Sanjin Mehic in the lab</thumb-alt><title>Sanjin Mehic</title><description>Students showcase one of UC Santa Cruz's most valuable opportunities—the chance to do original research as an undergraduate </description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b119a00a807270172b238cce13df8632"><name>water-meters</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus deploying cellular water meters to aid in conservation</title><summary>The project is another example of the campus commitment to sustainability and to saving water in the midst of a historic drought. &#13;

<p>The campus ran a 10-meter pilot last year to see if the technology would be right for UC Santa Cruz, said Energy Manager Patrick Testoni. Users were impressed by the ability to see usage by the day, week and past 30 days, and to think about how they might further reduce their consumption.</p>
<p>"You can't manage what you can't measure," Testoni said. "Everyone is Internet-savvy and we're trying to leverage that. This allows users to get instant feedback."</p>
<p>The project is another example of the campus commitment to sustainability and to saving water in the midst of a historic drought.</p>
<p>Daniel Press, professor and executive director for the Center of Agroeclolgy and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), has been able to track his water usage for the last few weeks at his house on campus.</p>
<p>His four-person household averages about 140 gallons per day, or about 35 gallons per person. That's well below the city's average of 95 gallons per person.</p>
<p>"We're already very mindful with our usage," Press said, adding that his house has low-flow fixtures and a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Press said he's looking forward to when the cellular broadcasters are installed at the farm so staff members can monitor usage and keep an eye out for leaks.</p>
<p>Last year, the campus met the 25 percent curtailment goal set by city leaders by reducing irrigation, installing low-flow toilets and sink fixtures, and educating the campus community about ways to modify their behavior.</p>
<p>Gov. Jerry Brown last month called on Californians to work even harder to save water as the historic drought continues for another year. UC Santa Cruz will be trying to match or surpass its savings to make the most out of this precious resource. The campus demand is about 6 percent of the total Santa Cruz Water District service area demand.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has about 400 meters that track water usage at residence halls, academic buildings, and in faculty and staff housing. The current meters provides usage statistics by day, though they're only available to users once a month. Someone has to drive by each meter with a laptop to download the data.</p>
<p>Each cellular device takes about 20 minutes to install. The project should be completed this month. Testoni said the city and other water districts are also considering this system.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b141d5c4807270172b238cce317b07d8"><name>sobrino-laura</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In memoriam: Laura Garciacano Sobrino, alumna became the 'Mariachi Queen'</title><summary>Laura Garciacano Sobrino (Porter, ’81, individual music major), who became one of the best-known female mariachi musicians in the United States and Mexico, died May 21 in Whittier, Ca., at age 60.</summary><start-date>1433197860000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: Laura Garciacano Sobrino</display-name><path>/2015/06/sobrino-laura</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/sobrino-laura</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1433197991331</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1433358391500</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Music</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/sobrino-laura-425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/sobrino-laura-425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sobrino-laura-425.jpg</name><display-name>sobrino-laura-425.jpg</display-name><file-size>242222</file-size><width>425</width><height>667</height></image><image-alt>Laura Garciacano Sobrino</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/sobrino-laura-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/sobrino-laura-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sobrino-laura-80.jpg</name><display-name>sobrino-laura-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>25012</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Laura Garciacano Sobrino</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Laura Garciacano Sobrino (Photos courtesy Olga Naj&#233;ra-Ramirez)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/sobrino-with-zamarippa-425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/sobrino-with-zamarippa-425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sobrino-with-zamarippa-425.jpg</name><display-name>sobrino-with-zamarippa-425.jpg</display-name><file-size>126113</file-size><width>425</width><height>423</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Sobrino with with Guadalajara dancer and choreographer Rafael Zamarripa when she was inducted into the Tucscon International Mariachi Hall of Fame.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Porter College graduate became the first woman to play in some of the nation's most prestigious mariachi groups</article-subhead><article-text><p>Laura Garciacano Sobrino (Porter, &#8217;81, individual music major), who became one of the best-known female mariachi musicians in the United States and Mexico, died May 21 in Whittier, Ca., at age 60.</p>
<p>Trained in classical violin from age 8 in elementary school, she began focusing on Mexican regional folk music at UC Santa Cruz and joined Grupo Folkl&#243;rico Los Mejicas on campus. The group is dedicating its 43<sup>rd</sup> annual spring concert this Friday and Saturday at the Theater Arts Mainstage Theater in her memory.</p>
<p>Sobrino was born Laura Garcia in Watsonville and graduated from Aptos High School before attending UC Santa Cruz.&#160; She quickly discovered that she had a special gift for Mexican music, remembers anthropology professor Olga Naj&#233;ra-Ram&#237;rez, who danced with the group as a UCSC student and serves as faculty advisor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura was an amazing and talented woman,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is a great loss to the community and to me personally.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even as an undergraduate, Laura was already leading music workshops on mariachi music, huasteca music, jarocho music, and norte&#241;o music,&#8221; Naj&#233;ra-Ramirez said. &#160;In preparation for her BA thesis, she chose to study mariachi music, working as an apprentice with some of the best mariachi musicians in the world. &#160;</p>
<p>After UCSC, she became the first woman to play in some of the nation's most prestigious mariachi groups. She was the first musical director of the first all-female mariachi show group in the U.S., Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles.&#160; In 1995, the Los Angeles Times dubbed her the "Mariachi Queen."</p>
<p>She was a violinist for Mariachi Mujer 2000 and served as musical director.&#160; In 2004, she was inducted into the Tucson International Mariachi Hall of Fame and was subsequently included in the "Latinas, the Spirit of California" exhibit at the California State Museum.</p>
<p>Sobrino taught in the music department at UC Riverside since 2006.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura&#8217;s accomplishments as an extraordinary and devoted music teacher are evident in the number and quality of students whom she has trained, including recording artists Nydia Rojas (Arista Records) and Tatiana Bola&#241;os (Sony International),&#8221; Naj&#233;ra-Ramirez said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.sobrino.net/music/LSobrino.html</url><title>Laura Garciacano Sobrino web page on Mariachi Publishing Co. </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b17df6b8807270172b238ccee1c49762"><name>lee-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>What's new in academic programs and online education</title><summary>By Herbie Lee, Vice Provost Academic Affairs – Every year, faculty add, update, and occasionally discontinue academic programs to ensure our students get the best possible education.

This year, we are making changes to the graduate and undergraduate curriculum, as well as to our online offerings.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce these enhancements to the UC Santa Cruz curriculum:</p>
<p>&#8226; We have started a new M.S. program in scientific computing and applied mathematics, based in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics. Students learn both computational methods and theoretical modeling, and graduates will be prepared to enter the growing market for data scientists and modelers in computationally intensive environments, including industry and government agencies. This program is open to students from a wide variety of backgrounds, and it can be completed in one year by students with sufficient preparation.</p>
<p>&#8226; Environmental Studies has added a concentration in agroecology and sustainable food systems to its B.A. program, starting in Fall 2015. Students will learn about ecological concepts and how to apply them to sustainable agricultural systems and will also develop their understanding of the social, political, and economic aspects of agriculture.</p>
<p>&#8226; Latin American and Latino Studies has discontinued two of its undersubscribed combined majors: the LALS/global economics combined major and the LALS/literature combined major. Currently declared students in these combined majors will be supported to a timely graduation, but no new declarations will be accepted. The more popular combined majors with politics and with sociology are continuing.</p>
<p>&#8226; Admissions have been suspended for the M.S. in Technology and Information Management.</p>
<p>There are several more new program proposals at various stages of the approval process, such as a proposal for a B.A. in games and playable media. Look for updates on my <a href="http://academicaffairs.ucsc.edu">website</a>.</p>
<p>Our campus has also been active in developing and offering fully online courses through UC's systemwide online initiatives. This year, students from all UC campuses were able to enroll in three fully online UCSC courses: <em>Calculus for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics</em> (MATH 19A and 19B), developed and taught by mathematicians Anthony Tromba and Frank B&#228;uerle; and <em>Introduction to Fresh Water: Processes and Policy</em> (ENVS 65), developed and taught by Brent Haddad in environmental studies.</p>
<p>From the outset, Tromba and B&#228;uerle were committed to developing an outstanding calculus course, and their course became the first in the UC system to receive articulation agreements on all UC campuses&#8212;a badge of honor for UCSC and a tribute to Tromba and B&#228;uerle.</p>
<p>More systemwide online courses are coming next year, beginning in the fall. Earth scientist Susan Schwartz collaborated with colleagues at UC Davis and UC San Diego to develop a fully online version of <em>Geology of National Parks</em> (EART 3), which will be open to all UC students in Fall 2015.</p>
<p>Three online courses are currently in development, with plans to be offered in Winter 2015: Len&#233; Whitley-Putz in the writing program is developing a course on the theme of Writing Disney (WRIT 2); Erika Zavaleta in environmental studies is developing <em>Ecosystems of California</em> (ENVS 125); and Tromba and B&#228;uerle are developing the first course in the Vector Calculus sequence (MATH 23A).</p>
<p>Finally, we are continuing our partnership with Coursera, offering free online courses developed by three of our esteemed senior or emeriti faculty: <em>The Holocaust</em> by literature professor Murray Baumgarten and history professor Peter Kenez, and <em>C++ for C Programmers</em> by computer science professor Ira Pohl. New versions of these courses will be released this summer and fall, respectively.</p>
<p>The initial offerings of these Coursera courses jointly enrolled 86,000 learners worldwide, many of whom otherwise lack access to first-rate educational materials. As online education continues to evolve, we can be proud of the quality and impact of our offerings.</p>
<p>Faculty interested in learning about opportunities to develop online courses are encouraged to contact Michael Tassio, the academic affairs analyst in my office, at <a href="mailto:mtassio@ucsc.edu">mtassio@ucsc.edu</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b5a6eee5807270172b238ccef797ed40"><name>community-bulletin-kresge-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Crime Bulletin: UPDATE -- Kresge College Investigation</title><summary>An arrest has been made in connection with the assault and hate crime investigation at Kresge College.</summary><start-date>1433228400000</start-date><display-name>Community Crime Bulletin: UPDATE -- Kresge College Investigation</display-name><path>/2015/06/community-bulletin-kresge-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/community-bulletin-kresge-update</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1433271725630</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1433272114675</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An arrest has been made in connection with the assault and hate crime investigation at Kresge College.<br/>
<br/>
 The UC Santa Cruz Police Department worked closely with the Santa Cruz County District Attorney's Office to move the case forward.<br/>
<br/>
 The UC Santa Cruz Police Department has been investigating the events that led to UC Santa Cruz students being injured during a Feb. 7 assault in which one or more of the suspects knew or perceived that one or more of the victims belonged to a protected classification, as listed in the California Hate Crime Statues. A Community Crime Bulletin was issued as a timely warning at the time of the incident.<br/>
<br/>
 In collaboration with the Santa Cruz County District Attorney's Office, UC Santa Cruz police gathered evidence and secured felony warrants for the arrest of Brandon W. Beaton, 22, who at the time was a Kresge College student, and Jesse E. Robles, 24, a non-affiliate from Los Banos. Beaton no longer is enrolled at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>

Your comments, questions and concerns were extremely informative. Those who attended the town hall meeting on May 26th offered additional insight into the proposal as currently structured.<br/>
<br/>
 The leadership teams in Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) and the Division of Business and Administrative Services (BAS) are analyzing the feedback to inform our next steps. This process will take substantial time and further consultation; as a result, we are not moving forward with the proposed fare increases at this time. We will take the next several months to engage further with stakeholder groups as we develop the path forward.<br/>

Student teams pitched their business concepts in an interactive format to Silicon Valley and Santa Cruz business leaders, entrepreneurs, faculty, and alumni.</p>
<p>Prior to the event, entrepreneur judges had heard the business pitches of all student contestants and decided on the top three winners. The afternoon began with an hour of networking, as attendees including VIP corporate guests visited the 19 student businesses on display to hear the student entrepreneurs' business pitches. Guests were allotted "slug bucks" with which to "seed fund" their favorite business plans, and the team receiving the most slug bucks won the People's Choice Award of $1,000.</p>
<p>The winning teams are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>First Place ($4,000): Slithr Electric Vehicles</strong> by Carl Demolder (B.S. electrical engineering, 2016). The first place award was sponsored by the Baskin School of Engineering Dean's Fund, courtesy of Dean Joseph Konopelski, who was on hand to present the first-place check to Demolder. Slithr Electric Vehicles uses patent-pending technology in its electric-powered, portable yet powerful longboards. Slithr's unique base unit adapts to any longboard deck, and the user may customize for height, riding ability, and style. Slithr also offers patented Shark Wheels with a third the friction of standard wheels. Riders control speed, acceleration, and braking with a handheld device, wireless app on a smart phone, or Myo armband.</p>
<p><strong>Second Place ($3,000): CareCuts</strong> by Caitlin Deigel (B.A. business management economics, 2015). The second place award was sponsored by the UCSC Office of Research, courtesy of Vice Chancellor of Research Scott Brandt, who was, unfortunately, unable to attend. Technology management lecturer John Skardon, from whose entrepreneurship classes most of the competitors came, presented Deigel with the second place check. She plans to use her prize money to launch the non-profit CareCuts, a safe voucher and online method for bringing homeless shelter residents to local salons for haircuts and styling to help them re-enter the workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Third Place ($2,000): Code Naturally</strong> by Sukhmeet Singh (B.S. technology and information management, 2015), Asher Gardner (B.A. philosophy, 2015), and Justin Blair (B.A. Film and Digital Media, 2016). The third place award was sponsored by the following Scotts Valley businesses: Ideas Siero Labs, artists.com, and Business With Pleasure, all owned by Marcelo Siero, a Ph.D. student in computer engineering. Siero was on hand to present Code Naturally with their check. He also donated $2,000 worth of printing services for this event: the four giant checks themselves, as well as programs, name tags, and sets of 100 business cards for several students for their businesses.

thesis films from the <a href="http://film.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>Film and Digital Media Department&#8217;s</strong></em></a> masters program in Social Documentation on Wednesday, June 10, at the Del Mar Theater in downtown Santa Cruz. 
<p>Seven engaging documentary films will be presented by students graduating this year.</p>
<p>One of the most innovative and progressive programs in the Arts Division, Soc Doc is designed for future documentarians committed to social change and to documenting communities, cultures, issues, and individuals.</p>
<p>&#8220;These documentaries are the culmination of an intense two years of immersion on the part of our dedicated students in the art of documentary media, scholarly research and analysis, nonfiction storytelling, and the politics of representation,&#8221; said associate professor of film and digital media John Jota Lean&#771;os, graduate director of the program.</p>
<p>"We are especially indebted to the affiliated faculty in other departments whose guidance and participation have helped to elevate the students&#8217; work into realms that go beyond the story,&#8221; Lean&#771;os added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We offer a special thanks to Academy Award-winning documentary editor, Kate Amend, who flies in from Los Angeles every year for intensive consultations and critiques with the graduating students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acting arts dean Martin Berger noted that the current Master of Arts (MA) degree in social documentation will soon be changing into a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree.</p>
<p>"Converting the Soc Doc degree into an MFA will acknowledge the artistic qualities of the students' work and provide them with a more marketable degree,&#8221; said Berger. &#8220;While the MA is typically seen as a mere steppingstone to a Ph.D, the MFA is a terminal degree for many creative fields in the arts."</p>
<p>The lineup for the film screenings at the Del Mar:</p>
<p><strong>Michelle Aguilar--<em>El Cacao</em></strong></p>
<p>In the lush rainforest of Bocas del Toro, Panama, an indigenous cacao farmer, his wife, and grandchildren confront environmental and economic complexities&#160;as they grow, harvest, and sell cacao beans for a global chocolate market. Does Fair Trade and organic certification really work? Documenting the exceptional wisdom, unconditional devotion, and proven ancient farming techniques of one hard-working Ng&#228;be farmer, Samuel Murillo, <em>El Cacao</em> complicates the question by examining the fairness of his trade.</p>
<p><strong>Egill Bjarnason--<em>Once the Ice Melts:</em>&#160;<em>Ittoqqortoomitt, One Summer</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Once the Ice Melts</em> explores the status of isolation and the future of traditions in what is arguably earth&#8217;s remotest town. It introduces a group of young adults in Ittoqqortoomitt, one of the last remaining hunting communities in Greenland, and observes them over the course of one summer. With harpoon skills an increasingly useless trade, they struggle to find their place in a High Arctic town of 438 people and 250 dogs--reduced to 437 residents by the time the documentary comes to an end.</p>
<p><strong>Taryn Lee Crenshaw--</strong><em><strong>The &#8220;QUARE&#8221; In There</strong></em></p>
<p>Shot in Oakland, California, <em>The &#8220;QUARE&#8221; In There</em> explores individuals whose lives demonstrate the value of complexity and self-definition. Roman--transman and LGBTQ advocate--defies the gender binary, while Brooklyn pushes its boundaries as a masculine-of-center woman. DJ Lady Ryan, Nenna, Sienna, and Ursula Rucker all explore the body, the voice, and movement through space as sources of liberation. With words, music, and everpresent style, <em>TQIT</em> pays homage to Black queer subjectivity.</p>
<p><strong>Juan C. D&#225;vila Santiago--</strong><em><strong>The Stand-by Generation (La generaci&#243;n del estanbai)</strong><br/>
</em></p>
<p>Focused on the island of Puerto Rico,&#160;<em>La generaci&#243;n del estanbai</em> follows&#160;the lives of young people caught in the&#160;&#8216;precariat&#8217;&#160;world of&#160;part-time and temporary under-employment devoid of security. A new&#160;generation of university graduates-- Efra&#237;n, Keishla, Nelson, Jes&#250;s-- choose to&#160;stay in&#160;Puerto Rico despite its ongoing financial crisis, but they are kept very busy&#160;struggling to survive by any means necessary as their&#160;aspirations are placed on&#160;standby.</p>
<p><strong>Cecily Engelhart--<em>Siouxtable Food</em></strong></p>
<p>Examining the relationships between food, culture, and history, <em>Siouxtable Food</em> journeys through time and space and the Northern Plains to deliver a contemporary look at the Sioux relationship to food. Unabashedly cheeky but still full of heart, this irreverent essay by a food scholar and tribal member tackles complicated issues through laughter and honesty. With painful memories and joyous celebration, it explores how the notion of &#8220;you are what you eat&#8221; can change even after generations of colonization.</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Garcia Candelaria--<em>Out of Sight, Out of Mind</em></strong></p>
<p>California inmate Anthony Robinson Jr. risks it all to help document the expensive and traumatic practice of shipping state prisoners to out-of-state private prisons. Using a contraband cell phone, Anthony offers first-person insights into his experience from inside the walls of a private prison located in the heart of the Mississippi Delta. With the help of an activist newspaper, old friend, and private-prison experts, Anthony eloquently dissects a system that has made him a commodity to be bought and sold.</p>
<p><strong>Rana Jarbou--<em>Hajwalah</em> &#160;</strong></p>
<p><em>Hajwalah</em> explores the city of Riyadh through the eyes of protagonist Rakan and his passion for the &#8220;motorsport&#8221; of joyriding. When he has to quit, Rakan inhabits the &#8220;hajwalah&#8221; world virtually through gaming. In parallel, <em>Hajwalah</em> claims its own sense of place in the rapidly growing desert metropolis through the lens of the filmmaker herself, gazing through the window of a car traversing the city. Throughout, the underlying regulation of social interactions and relations is reflected through the filmmaking process.</p>
<p><strong>The film screenings begin at 6 p.m. Admission is free and open to the public.</strong></p>

<p>That she was the lone female faculty member in natural sciences at the new UC Santa Cruz campus was remarkable enough. But the fact Langenheim was actually teaching a class on the ecology of redwoods, not in a classroom but beneath a starry sky and under a stand of the towering trees, was even more notable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was convinced this informal atmosphere of learning in the field and the relationships students and faculty shared there often inspired life-long environmental interests,&#8221; said the now 90-year-old Langenheim.</p>
<p>It was that freedom to teach in unconventional ways and engage in research among a close-knit faculty that attracted Langenheim to the Santa Cruz campus in 1966. Many of the pioneering teachers and staff who came to UC Santa Cruz between 1964 and 1967 would be drawn by the same thing.</p>
<p>Born out of the vision of then-UC President Clark Kerr and Dean McHenry, a former UCLA political science professor who was named the first chancellor of the new campus, UC Santa Cruz was to be a grand experiment in education.</p>
<p>It proposed knocking down the walls of a stodgy bureaucracy, encouraging innovation, and allowing students the intimacy of a small college within a large research institution.</p>
<p>But it was the early staff and faculty &#8212; many of which came from places like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and even Kings College at Cambridge University &#8212; who actually carried out the plan and, in the process, established the roots of what UC Santa Cruz is today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody wanted to come. It was the talk of the country,&#8221; said Todd Newberry, a Stanford-trained professor of biology who arrived at the university in 1965. &#8220;How many times in your life do you get to start a university? It was going to focus on undergrads, and that&#8217;s where my heart was.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campus attracted new thinkers like a horseback-riding historian from UCLA named Page Smith, the charismatic art history professor Mary Holmes, the brilliant history professor and WWII veteran William Hitchcock, and the gangly Harvard-trained Byron Stookey Jr., who would become head of academic planning for UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The hires were old, young, liberal, and conservative. Some came with impressive bodies of work. Other put their academic careers in jeopardy by arriving at an institution that put an emphasis on undergraduate teaching rather than on being published. They played sports with students, ate with students, invited them into their homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course it was exceptional and we knew it and a lot of people felt it,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz pioneer History Professor John Dizikes in his oral history. &#8220;And (Cowell College founding Provost) Page Smith propagated overwhelmingly the idea shared by most of us, to a great degree, that we were now going to help with the reform of American higher education.&#8221;</p>
<p>And reform they did.</p>
<p>One of the first revolutionary acts of the faculty was to toss out letter grades in favor of a pass/fail system with narrative evaluations. The move was urged by Smith, who believed letter grades created a competitive situation where some students prospered at the expense of others and had no place in learning.</p>
<p>Or as the flamboyant pioneer Art History Professor Jasper Rose reportedly said, &#8220;Students are not vegetables. We don&#8217;t need to grade them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nancy Pascal, who worked in the Registrar&#8217;s Office starting in 1966, remembered the faculty writing evaluations of students on &#8220;sticky labels, and then we&#8217;d get the labels and we&#8217;d paste them onto the right student&#8217;s records. Later the college staff would have to retype them, so there was this huge effort to support the narrative evaluation for students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, many of those who gave &#8212; and received &#8212; these narrative assessments say they were one of the best parts of UC Santa Cruz, a concrete sign that teachers were actually paying attention to students.</p>
<p>Besides a lack of grades, there were other indications the early faculty and staff weren't creating your father&#8217;s university.</p>
<p>There were weekly &#8220;college nights,&#8221; where faculty, staff, and students sat down to a semi-formal dinner with stimulating guest speakers like beat poet Allen Ginsberg, writer/activist Susan Sontag, writer Ana&#239;s Nin, and jazz musician Don Ellis.</p>
<p>There were thought-provoking college courses, which pressed against the boundaries of traditional teaching. Newberry co-taught a college course on death and another on the sense of place. Courses on building a house, on dreams, and on national identity were offered.</p>
<p>Harry Berger, a literature professor who came to UC Santa Cruz from Yale in 1965 and went on to become a respected literary and cultural critic, also remembered Cowell&#8217;s famous core course on world civilization. The course included seminars led, not just by humanities professors, but also, in this new world of learning, by biologists, economists, political scientists, and chemists &#8212; many who found themselves in unfamiliar territory.</p>
<p>&#8220;It encouraged and supported team-teaching,&#8221; Berger said of the experience. &#8220;It made it easy for people in different fields to teach together. I team-taught courses with classicists, anthropologists, and sociologists&#8230; . For me, this meant that I was not only a teacher of undergraduates but also a student of my colleagues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the faculty and staff found themselves improvising, inventing, and tackling assignments they&#8217;d never imagined.</p>
<p>Pioneer professor of psychology and sociology Bill Domhoff organized a two-day, all-campus &#8220;culture break&#8221; during those first years. He brought in folklorist Alan Dundes, who gave a talk on the psychology of elephant jokes, and recruited an expert who spoke on drugs and creativity. There were talks on dreams, screenings of Ingmar Bergman movies, and construction of a fake beach, complete with lifeguard, on the East Field.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beauty of it turned out to be that students learned to think for themselves and to be more creative,&#8221; Domhoff said of the event he dubbed &#8220;The Fantasy Festival.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the times were already changing. Student protests over the Vietnam War and Civil Rights rattled the campus, and the weight of overturning old systems began to take a toll.</p>
<p>Faculty discovered themselves overwhelmed by the workloads of both the colleges and what were called boards of studies. Some of the campus&#8217;s brightest teachers were denied tenure because the entrenched UC advancement system didn&#8217;t take into account the new campus&#8217;s values. Political pressures mounted. Some of the old ways crept back in.</p>
<p>But one of the things that remained was UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s maverick spirit, an attitude that fostered improbable campus achievements like being the first to sequence the human genome, saving the endangered Peregrine falcon from extinction, finding new ways to peer more deeply into space, and helping to put organic food on American tables.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;&#8230;You walk across campus now and there are all those energetic, interested young people who are finding their way in life and learning,&#8221; said Jerry Walters, a pioneering staff member whose job included the daunting task of housing 652 students after construction delays meant they had nowhere to live. &#8220;And then, there are the discoveries and other things going on (at UC Santa Cruz) that don&#8217;t just have local impact but have national and worldwide impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man who retired as executive director of housing, dining, and childcare paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it just makes me proud.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c5f44e67807270172b238ccee2c8f15f"><name>coastal-nurseries</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fish declines linked to effects of excess nutrients on coastal estuaries</title><summary>Offshore fisheries that depend on the health of fish nurseries in coastal estuaries are adversely affected by excess nutrients in runoff from land</summary><keywords>Brent Hughes, Elkhorn Slough, agricultural runoff, land-sea interface, eutrophication, English sole, fish nurseries</keywords><start-date>1433790060000</start-date><display-name>Fish declines linked to effects of excess nutrients on coastal estuaries</display-name><path>/2015/06/coastal-nurseries</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/coastal-nurseries</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1433545231946</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1433968730143</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/slough-algae-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/slough-algae-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>slough-algae-450.jpg</name><display-name>slough-algae-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>93748</file-size><width>450</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt>algae in Elkhorn Slough</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/slough-sampling-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/slough-sampling-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>slough-sampling-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>slough-sampling-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17399</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>researcher sampling algae</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Excess nutrients stimulate the growth of algae in Elkhorn Slough, leading to the formation of green algal mats on the surface.

The <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/06/03/1505815112.abstract">study</a>, published the week of June 8, 2015, in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, focused on Elkhorn Slough and Monterey Bay on California's central coast.</p>
<p>Lead author Brent Hughes, now a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of California, Santa Cruz, began studying water quality in Elkhorn Slough as a UCSC graduate student. His earlier research showed that virtually every portion of the estuary is adversely affected by high nutrient levels, which stimulate the growth of algae, leading to low oxygen levels when the algae die and decompose. The new study, based on data collected over the past 40 years, shows how low levels of dissolved oxygen (a condition known as "hypoxia") affects fish populations in the estuary and beyond.</p>
<p>"We found that declines in dissolved oxygen levels were consistently associated with declines in the diversity and abundance of fish in Elkhorn Slough," Hughes said. "In particular, we saw a drop in certain species of fish that we know use the estuary as a nursery ground for juveniles."</p>
<p>English sole is one of the fish species that uses Elkhorn Slough as a nursery, and the study found that low oxygen was associated not only with fewer juveniles in the estuary, but also with later declines in the numbers of English sole caught in the commercial fishery and scientific fish surveys in Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>"From a conservation perspective, these findings suggest that improvements in land management and reductions in nutrient runoff could directly benefit estuaries and indirectly benefit offshore fisheries due to the important role of estuaries as nurseries for some species," said coauthor Mary Gleason, lead marine scientist for The Nature Conservancy in California.</p>
<h2>Long-term data sets</h2>
<p>To conduct the study, the research team assembled long-term data sets from various sources on fish abundance, water quality, and oceanographic and climatic factors over the past 40 years. According to Gleason, the availability of these long-term data sets for Elkhorn Slough and Monterey Bay offered a rare opportunity to study the linkages between coastal land use, water quality in the estuary, and offshore fisheries.</p>
<p>In addition to English sole, many other fish use Elkhorn Slough as a nursery for their young, including other flatfish species such as California halibut, speckled sanddabs, and starry flounder, as well as leopard sharks and bat rays. The slough also supports sea otters, harbor seals, Dungeness crabs, and many species of birds.</p>
<p>"A large assemblage of species uses the slough as a nursery ground, and because it is the only major estuary between San Francisco and Morro Bay, its role as a nursery is important for the whole region," Hughes said. "By looking at the whole assemblage of fish, we found that hypoxia affects the diversity of the system as well as the abundance of individual species."</p>
<p>Over the four decades covered by the study, Elkhorn Slough has received steadily increasing influxes of nutrients, mostly from fertilizer in runoff from agricultural fields in the surrounding watershed and the Salinas Valley. But Hughes said that dissolved oxygen levels have been highly variable over the same time because periods of high rainfall can effectively flush out of the estuary the accumulated organic matter generated by excessive nutrients.</p>
<h2>El Nino</h2>
<p>In particular, the researchers found that strong El Ni&#241;o events, characterized by increased rainfall and warm ocean temperatures along the California coast, were associated with improved dissolved oxygen levels in Elkhorn Slough and other estuaries. In addition to bringing rain, El Ni&#241;o can also suppress the upwelling of cold, deep ocean water along the coast. This wind-driven upwelling normally brings essential nutrients into nutrient-limited nearshore ecosystems such as Monterey Bay, but the deep water is also low in oxygen and may exacerbate hypoxic conditions when it enters the slough.</p>
<p>"In most estuaries we looked at across the Northeast Pacific, dissolved oxygen conditions responded positively in El Ni&#241;o years," Hughes said.</p>
<p>While nutrient levels in Elkhorn Slough are primarily affected by agricultural runoff, urban landscapes can also dump excess nutrients into coastal ecosystems. As a result, areas along the southern California coast are also being affected by nutrient enrichment and hypoxia, Hughes said.</p>
<p>"We are finding hypoxic areas wherever we look," he said. "Nitrogen is nitrogen, whether it comes from an agricultural field or sewage or urban runoff. It causes algal blooms, the algae dies and sinks, microbial mats form, and as the microbes consume the algae they deplete the oxygen in the water."</p>
<h2>&#65279;Climate change</h2>
<p>The researchers found that climate can be a powerful moderator of coastal hypoxia, but the effects of climate change are hard to predict. Climate change is likely to bring warmer water temperatures in the future, and warm water holds less oxygen than cold water. It is also likely to influence the frequency and intensity of El Ni&#241;o events, but exactly how is still unclear. While more research is needed to develop predictive models of how climate change will affect coastal ecosystems, reducing the stress caused by nutrient enrichment and hypoxia will improve the resilience of those ecosystems and help buffer the effects of climate change, Hughes said.</p>
<p>According to Gleason, there are many opportunities for improving coastal land management practices. "This study demonstrates the important connections between land management and the health of our estuaries and oceans. We need to have better dialog between land managers and ocean managers--between farmers and fishermen--to ensure that land use practices are being improved to reduce adverse effects of nutrients on coastal and marine ecosystems," she said.</p>
<p>In the area around Elkhorn Slough, The Nature Conservancy is working with partners to reduce nutrient runoff through improved land management practices and treatment wetlands. "Poor water quality is an important threat to some offshore fisheries and marine biodiversity, so it's critical to improve land-based management and reduce runoff," said Gleason. "In addition to managing nutrient applications, another &#160;solution is to restore or build wetlands at the lower end of drainage systems from farms. These treatment wetlands can collect, filter, and treat agriculture discharge water to reduce nutrient levels before the water enters the estuary."</p>
<p>In addition to Hughes and Gleason, the research team included scientists from the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and SeaSpatial Consulting.

<p>This year's winners of the <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/committees/cot-committee-on-teaching/cot-excellence-in-teaching/index.html">Excellence in Teaching Awards</a> administered by the Academic Senate are:</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Grace Pe&#241;a Delgado</strong>, associate professor of history</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Cormac Flanagan</strong>, professor of computer science</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Craig Haney</strong>, professor of psychology</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Christine Hong</strong>, assistant professor of literature</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Irene Lusztig</strong>, associate professor of film and digital media</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Mark Massoud</strong>, assistant professor of politics</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Ralph Quinn</strong>, lecturer in psychology</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Adriane Steinacker</strong>, lecturer in astronomy and astrophysics, winner of the Ron Ruby Award for Teaching Excellence in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences</p>
<p>At a celebratory lunch yesterday, I told recipients that both teaching and research are highly valued at UC Santa Cruz, and faculty distinguish UC Santa Cruz in both arenas; it's not an "either/or" choice on this campus.</p>
<p>These awards are presented annually by the Academic Senate's Committee on Teaching. Students nominated more than 200 faculty members this year&#8212;a testament to the depth of excellence in teaching here. Nominees were asked to submit a statement about their teaching philosophy, and committee members solicited letters of support from department chairs before selecting the winners.</p>
<p>Grace Delgado's student evaluations are exceptional, covered with "blizzards of exclamation points" that reflect her "student-centered" approach to teaching, wrote History Department Chair Mark Cioc.</p>
<p>Cormac Flanagan considers teaching his most important responsibility at the university and takes pride in seeing graduates land jobs at major universities and corporation like Google.</p>
<p>Students in Craig Haney's classes say he helps them see the criminal justice system in new ways&#8212;and inspires them to get involved in making it better. Psychology Department Chair Heather Bullock noted that many of Craig's former students have pursued careers as public defenders, public interest lawyers, psychologists, and social workers. Craig also delivered this year's Faculty Research Lecture&#8212;our campus's highest research honor&#8212;a reminder that many of our faculty excel in both research and teaching.</p>
<p>At the beginning of every course, Christine Hong asks students to write her a letter of introduction, telling her whatever they would like her to know about themselves. That personal touch doesn't end with the quarter; one student wrote that Christine checked in via email every quarter to see how the concepts and issues they had discussed in one seminar were evolving.</p>
<p>In her statement, Professor Lusztig described the "wrenching, intensely personal, and vulnerable" process of filmmaking&#8212;and her goal as a teacher to guide the process of self-discovery that is fundamental to each student's growth as an artist.</p>
<p>Mark Massoud earned high marks for his lectures and classroom strategies, which include role playing, debate, student presentations, and guest speakers. His creative approach is evident during office hours, too&#8212;he often invites groups of students to take a walk with him, encouraging the free flow of ideas outside of the classroom or office.</p>
<p>Students who nominated Ralph Quinn spoke almost in one voice, saying he had changed their life. Ralph, who has been a psychotherapist for more than 25 years, says bringing empathy, respect, and care to the classroom is more effective than browbeating, intimidation, and disdain.</p>
<p>Adriane Steinacker's enthusiasm for physics is infectious, which is why Department Chair Robert Johnson says there's no one else he would rather have teach Physics 6&#8212;a large introductory class for non-physical science majors. To her credit, Adriane enjoys the challenge of motivating non-majors to master a subject many approach with fear and trepidation. Nothing beats watching students who dreaded physics come to enjoy it, she says.</p>
<p>All of this contributes to what makes UC Santa Cruz such a great place to learn. My thanks to members of the Committee on Teaching for administering the awards&#8212;and my heartfelt congratulations to this year's winners.</p>
<p>As we prepare to graduate the Class of 2015, I want to thank the entire "village" of faculty and staff that is dedicated to the success of our students. Without you, there would be no UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>To our soon-to-be graduates, you are about to join a network of UC Santa Cruz alumni that's 100,000 strong. As you transition away from the campus, remember: Once a Banana Slug, always a Banana Slug.

<p>In presenting the awards June 4, Chancellor Blumenthal noted that the program, now in its 13<sup>th</sup> year, has given out nearly 70 awards to date and that diversity is integral to the campus&#8217;s success. &#8220;Enrollment today reflects the diversity of the state of California more than at any time in our history&#8212;and I am proud of that,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;Diversity is an integral part of what we do, and it's making a difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lifetime Achievement Award went to Susan Willats, assistant director of Transportation and Parking Services, for serving as a leader and champion for disability access since she began her UC Santa Cruz career in 1986 as a van driver with the Disability Resource Center.</p>
<p>Rita Mehta, assistant professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, was honored for advancing women and historically underserved communities in science, technology, engineering, and math fields. She&#8217;s been affiliated with STEM diversity programs since she arrived at UC Santa Cruz in 2010.</p>
<p>Zia Isola, director of diversity programs at the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, was cited for her commitment to increasing diversity on campus for women, students of color, students with disabilities, and first-generation college students. She is also director of the UCSC Genomics Institute's Office of Diversity, and staff advisor to the UCSC Women in Science and Engineering group.</p>
<p>Jessica Manuela Loya, an Oakes College senior graduating this spring, was recognized for her commitment to social justice and to promoting diversity and inclusion on campus. She was a lead coordinator of the 2014 Practical Activism Conferences and started a safe space for leadership development for LGBTQ communities.</p>
<p>Also winning Achievement Awards for Diversity were the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) SOMECA (SOAR/Student Media/Cultural Arts and Diversity) for many years of promoting student success and engagement.</p>
<p>A new award was announced, the Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) Award, won by Charlie McDowell, professor of Computer Science, and Adrienne Harrell, director of undergraduate student affairs and the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Both have assisted with Project Awesome and Girls in Engineering. &#160;Project Awesome has ongoing efforts to recruit and retain more women students in computer science and computer engineering. Girls in Engineering is a focused computing camp for middle school girls.</p>
<p>The awards program is sponsored by the Chancellor&#8217;s Office, Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and Staff Human Resources.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="da2c0745807270172b238cce0081f6af"><name>parking-for-year-end-activities</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Parking during year-end activities</title><summary>As the campus prepares for the many commencement and year-end celebrations this weekend, I wanted to alert you to the impact this will have on traffic and parking. </summary><start-date>1433833200000</start-date><display-name>Parking during year-end activities</display-name><path>/2015/06/parking-for-year-end-activities</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/parking-for-year-end-activities</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1433884428073</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1433884497912</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>As the campus prepares for the many commencement and year-end celebrations this weekend, I wanted to alert you to the impact this will have on traffic and parking. On Friday alone, there are 16 departmental or organizational celebrations scheduled throughout the day, resulting in hundreds of visitors needing on-campus parking. Parking in the East Remote lot will be free on Friday to accommodate many of them. However, traffic on campus will be much heavier than usual, and parking for some celebrations will be in centrally-located parking lots. Please consider coordinating with your supervisor to work off-site or from home on Friday, or consider using alternative transportation to get to campus. Metro buses serving the UCSC campus will be fare-free on Saturday and Sunday. Campus shuttles will be operating on the summer intersession Loop bus schedule (starting at 7:30 a.m.) on Friday, with added evening Loop buses operating until 10 p.m. During the weekend campus shuttle service will ope<br/>
 rate from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.<br/>
 <br/>
 If you routinely park on campus with a valid UCSC parking permit, you should be able to park in the lot you normally use on Friday. Display your permit as usual, and please don't park in spaces reserved for VIPs, "Special Pass" holders, or disabled visitors.<br/>
 <br/>
 If you will be on campus during the weekend, please be aware that traffic restrictions will be in place on Hagar Drive, which will be closed in the downhill direction from Steinhart Drive to the East Remote parking lot. If you will be leaving campus from the west side or campus core, please use Coolidge Drive, as Heller Drive may be heavily impacted with commencement ceremony traffic.<br/>
 <br/>
 If you have questions about parking on campus this weekend, please call Eric Kraus at TAPS at 831-459-2190.<br/>
 <br/>
 Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty, Staff and Graduate Students</audience><admin>Larry Pageler, Transportation and Parking Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="da8151c3807270172b238ccea32ce00d"><name>genome-anniversary</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A visionary, a genius, and the human genome</title><summary>In 2000, two dogged researchers at UC Santa Cruz defied the odds to become the first in the world to assemble the DNA sequence of the human genome.</summary><keywords>David Haussler, Jim Kent, UCSC Genome Browser, UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</keywords><start-date>1434956400000</start-date><display-name>A visionary, a genius, and the human genome</display-name><path>/2015/06/genome-anniversary</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/genome-anniversary</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1433890017700</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1435680761439</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><p><iframe frameborder="0" height="461" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lVnqEM5MjyM" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>A private firm named Celera Genomics was beating a path to the prize with a big budget and what was reported to be the most powerful computer cluster in civilian use.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an international consortium of scientists&#8212;which Haussler had only recently been invited to join&#8212;was lagging behind.</p>
<p>Haussler, a tall man with a penchant for Hawaiian shirts, had managed to wrangle 100 Dell Pentium III processor workstations for the project. About 30 had been purchased but others had been intended for student use&#8212;until Dean of Engineering Patrick Mantey and Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood agreed Haussler could "break in" the machines before they went into classrooms.</p>
<p>Each of the computers was less powerful than one of today's smart phones, but, nevertheless, the UC Santa Cruz group was able to link them together for parallel processing, creating a makeshift "supercomputer" for the project.</p>
<p>What happened next was the stuff of movies: a genius and a brilliant computer scientist at an upstart university defying the odds to become the first in the world to assemble the DNA pieces of the human genome. At the time, then-president Bill Clinton called the Human Genome Project an historic achievement and one that would revolutionize the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disease.</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, that prediction is coming true.</p>
<p>Haussler knew the public project had a formidable competitor in Celera. The private firm's assembly project was being led by a talented and close friend who had been a fellow graduate student with Haussler at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Haussler had also sensed, early on, there was trouble with the public consortium's assembly project, which was being done at other institutions. Then, the head of Celera, J. Craig Venter, and the leader of the public consortium, Dr. Francis Collins, announced they would jointly report the results of their projects at the White House on June 26, 2000.</p>
<p>The pressure was on.</p>
<h3>A whiteboard and a computer</h3>
<p>Concerned, Haussler had started his own skunkworks project, a behind-the-scenes attempt to write a program that would assemble the 600,000 fragments of DNA the consortium decoded into a comprehensible sequence.</p>
<p>"It became evident the consortium was really in a bad position," Haussler said. "They hadn't found any way to do the assembly in time and our skunkworks project wasn't producing a way to do it quickly enough, either."</p>
<p>Enter Jim Kent, a then-UC Santa Cruz graduate student in molecular, cell, and developmental biology who had spent his early years in the technology world writing paint and animation programs.</p>
<p>A quiet man who tames his dark hair under a grey fedora, Kent had worked on bioinformatics problems in Professor Alan Zahler's lab, including writing a genome browser for the worm <em>C. elegans.</em></p>
<p>Kent, who had been introduced to Haussler by Zahler, had joined Haussler's team five months earlier and was aware of the difficulty in getting the skunkworks assembly program to scale.</p>
<p>Kent worried that if a private corporation sequenced the human genome first, thousands of genes might be patented, hamstringing the free dissemination of information to anyone who needed it.</p>
<p>So for two weeks, Kent sat at his computer in the garage of his Seabright home, secretly writing and testing a program he thought might work.</p>
<p>"It was just me and a whiteboard and my computer," Kent said.</p>
<h3>Humanity's first glimpse of its genetic heritage</h3>
<p>On May 22, Kent emailed Haussler saying he thought he had found a way to write an assembly program using a simpler strategy, utilizing something called a greedy algorithm, which solves a problem by making decisions that seem most promising at the moment rather than looking for optimal answers.</p>
<p>Haussler replied with one word: "Godspeed."</p>
<p>"So Jim went for it," Haussler said. "It was a classic scene. I knew Jim was a genius, and I thought, 'It may be hopeless but, at this point, what have we got to lose?' Celera had one of the most powerful computer systems at the time, and we, basically, had 100 cell phones."</p>
<p>"It was game on," remembered Kent, who huddled in his garage office for the next month, writing 10,000 lines of code so furiously and for so many hours, he had to ice his wrists in order to be able to go on.</p>
<p>On June 22, four days before the White House announcement&#8212;and three days before Celera finished its computer assembly&#8212;Kent ran the code to complete the first successful draft sequence of the human genome using the UC Santa Cruz computer farm and 13 sets of data sources.</p>
<p>The announcement of the successful sequencing of the human genome was hailed around the globe, and Haussler and Kent had the honor of posting the first human genome on the Internet on July 7.</p>
<p>"That was truly a great moment in UC Santa Cruz history. It was an emotional day," said Haussler. "Humanity got its first glimpse of its genetic heritage. It was an ocean of A's, C's, G's and T's representing the cumulative successes and failures of innumerable generations that went before us, molding who we are by the process of natural selection."</p>
<p>And thanks to UC Santa Cruz, it was there for everyone to see, free and unrestricted.</p>
<h3>A free resource&#8212;for all, forever</h3>
<p>And see they did.</p>
<p>That first day, a half a trillion bytes of information flowed out from UC Santa Cruz's servers.</p>
<p>Three months later, Kent debuted the UCSC Genome Browser, a graphic web-based "microscope" for exploring the human genome sequence that was available free to anyone who wanted it.</p>
<p>"It all started here," said Francis Collins, then director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, speaking before a capacity crowd at UC Santa Cruz's Human Genome Symposium in 2001. (Collins is now director of the National Institutes of Health.) In his keynote address, Collins recognized the "absolutely critical role" of UC Santa Cruz researchers in assembling the genome sequence, as well as their ongoing contributions to the Human Genome Project. He noted, "Without the computational work of David Haussler and graduate student Jim Kent, we would not have seen the genome emerge in the way I can tell you about here."</p>
<p>Today, thousands of biomedical researchers worldwide use the UCSC Genome Browser in their work to uncover the causes of disease and develop new treatments. Currently, the Genome Browser serves about 150,000 users and gets about a million hits each day.</p>
<p>For Kent, the browser "was one of the joys of the human genome project."</p>
<p>"We were conscious we were doing the right thing," Haussler said of the genome and its free and open browser. "We knew there would be enormous medical benefit and scientific understanding that would come from this."</p>
<p>Both Haussler and Kent also say what happened at UC Santa Cruz might not have happened anywhere else.</p>
<p>Besides a spirit of collaboration on campus, there is a kind of brash self-confidence to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"I appreciate Santa Cruz for its extraordinary boldness in wanting to do things differently, not feeling restricted to the traditional ways of approaching things," said Haussler, sitting in his cluttered campus office on Science Hill. "Even though we're a small university, we ask big questions."&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UC

Dizikes.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>History professor Kate Jones was presented with the <strong>John Dizikes Teaching Award in Humanities</strong> at the Humanities Division&#8217;s 2015 Spring Awards celebration held at the Cowell Provost House.</p>
<p>Established in 2002 to honor outstanding teaching by humanities faculty, the award was named in honor of one of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s founding faculty members.</p>
<p>Now a professor emeritus of American studies, John Dizikes served as Cowell College provost and mentored thousands of students during his 30-year teaching career.</p>
<p>In addition to being honored with a check for $3,000, Jones was also entitled to select an undergraduate student to receive a $3,000 scholarship. She chose Jacob Perez, a senior history major who aspires to be a high school history teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally I see teaching as a wide-ranging, sometimes ragged, sometimes ecstatic process that depends on collaboration and experimentation,&#8221; Jones noted. &#8220;Before I ever walk into a classroom, I get to collaborate with hundreds of people--poring over the work of other scholars, searching for images or rich passages for shared investigation, and buttonholing colleagues to ask about how they approach challenges in the classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added that the classroom should be a place where students and teachers can experiment with ways of knowing and ways of learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes this means a day of classroom transcendence, when you can feel the energy of engagement and genuine exchange of ideas suffusing the space,&#8221; said Jones. &#8220;Other times it means modeling both the willingness to experiment and the willingness to fail, for example when a new assignment fails to cohere in the way one imagined.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teaching feels like doing a high-wire act on a windy day--the conditions change rapidly, techniques that worked last time might not work this time, but you move forward in confidence that there is a net beneath you, strongly knit out of a sense of common cause, and the knowledge that everyone wants you to get back up there even if you do fall off.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Student scholarship recipient Perez</strong> noted that his definition of history has changed after four years of study on campus, taking history classes ranging from the Civil War to modern East Asia.</p>
<p>&#8220;After taking my first couple of history classes here at UC Santa Cruz, I slowly began to realize that history was much more than just facts about events that had happened in the past,&#8221; said Perez. &#8220;The idea of a dichotomy in history--one true narrative and false narrative to explain any given event&#8211;was very quickly dispelled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The various history professors at UC Santa Cruz quickly revealed to me different viewpoints that caused me to question the simplicity of history. I realized that nothing in the world is so black and white, and that every story told, every narrative shared, should not quickly be accepted as fact but looked at through a critical lens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;History is being able to critically think and question if the historical narratives being told are correct, or is there an agenda that is giving misinformation about the event,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I want to teach my future students to be critical thinkers and to constantly question if what they are being told is true.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="df6de4db807270172b238cce83f5dda5"><name>systemwide-EHS-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus earns  systemwide environmental health and safety award </title><summary>The University of California President’s Award for Campus Excellence in Environmental Health and Safety is given to the UC campus with the greatest reduction of Cal/OSHA recordable cases (medical treatment beyond first aid) in the past year and the overall reduction in injury rate from previous years. </summary><start-date>1433970000000</start-date><display-name>Campus earns UC systemwide safety award </display-name><path>/2015/06/systemwide-EHS-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/systemwide-EHS-award</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1433972630719</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1433973608964</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/EHS-award-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/EHS-award-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>EHS-award-500px.jpg</name><display-name>EHS-award-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>78212</file-size><width>500</width><height>405</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Through programs managed by Environmental Health and Safety and Risk Services, UC Santa Cruz has significantly improved safety and reduced the number of employee injuries. The efforts have saved the campus $3.7 million in workers' compensation costs last year and led to systemwide recognition.</p>
<p>The University of California President's Award for Campus Excellence in Environmental Health and Safety is given to the UC campus with the greatest reduction of Cal/OSHA recordable cases (medical treatment beyond first aid) in the past year and the overall reduction in injury rate from previous years.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz achieved its reduction through a joint effort between all the campus partners who focus on mitigating risks. The types of injuries prevented include slip/trips, ergonomic problems, wellness, and more.</p>
<p>The campus EH&amp;S and Risk offices used temporary UC Office of the President "Be Smart About Safety" funding to create a safety wellness injury management team that includes: safety and loss prevention specialists, wellness coordinator, ergonomist, transitional return-to-work coordinator, safety trainer, lab safety staff, and others.</p>
<p>These individuals proactively create and implement safety programs. They also investigate accident and meet monthly to discuss all injuries that have occurred and put in place new preventative measures for the campus.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e3ab2fef807270172b238cce40bc874e"><name>police-ambassadors</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Police ambassador program helps students with career plans</title><summary>Graduating students Wesley Huynh and Jessica Bauman found that the UC Santa Cruz Police Ambassador Program helped prepare them for careers in law enforcement and accounting. </summary><start-date>1434042000000</start-date><display-name>Police ambassador program</display-name><path>/2015/06/police-ambassadors</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/police-ambassadors</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1434043756488</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1434125083916</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/police-ambassador-400px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/police-ambassador-400px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>police-ambassador-400px.jpeg</name><display-name>police-ambassador-400px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>26293</file-size><width>400</width><height>257</height></image><image-alt>Wesley Huynh</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/police-ambassador-80px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/police-ambassador-80px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>police-ambassador-80px.jpeg</name><display-name>police-ambassador-80px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>6337</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Wesley Huynh found that working alongside officers in the UC Santa Cruz Department affirmed his plan to go into law enforcement after graduation.

Huynh, a junior in high school, was able to escape through his bedroom window and call the police.</p>
<p>His family was unharmed, and Huynh was consoled by the Oakland Police Department's response in helping calm everyone. The incident left an indelible mark on Huynh and helped crystalize his desire to become a police officer.</p>
<p>Huynh will be graduating Saturday from College 9 with a degree in business management economics and is working toward becoming an officer with the Oakland Police Department. Huynh and others have found their time working as UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://police.ucsc.edu/get-involved/student-ambassador.html">police ambassadors</a> helped prepare them for their careers.</p>
<p>Jessica Bauman, a business management economics student graduating from Stevenson College, spent two years working with the police department's business manager.</p>
<p>"Before, I only had experience in food service," Bauman said. "This was a chance to break away into the business world and learn office skills that would help me later on."</p>
<p>The experience helped her land an internship with KMPG, a global network of accounting firms. After her 10-week internship last summer ended, the company offered her a full-time job after graduation. In addition to getting ready to move to Santa Clara for the job, she's preparing to become a certified public accountant.</p>
<p>Huynh is in the midst of the Oakland Police Academy's selection process. He passed the physical ability test, written examination, interview panel, and a polygraph exam. He's undergoing a background investigation and will soon be assessed psychologically and medically.</p>
<p>If he's accepted into the academy, he'll have six months of classroom training and six months of field training. Having seen the impacts of crime and violence first hand, Huynh wants to help improve his hometown.</p>
<p>"I realize the importance the Oakland Police Department has in this crime-ridden community," Huynh said. "The importance of being there can help deter a robbery or comfort people after a robbery. That's important work I'd like to do to make a difference."</p>
<p>Huynh enrolled in the Citizens Police Academy taught by Officer Tony Contreras during the winter quarter of his first year, thinking that a career in law enforcement might be his calling. By summer 2013, he was working as a police ambassador, a job that can have students helping the department with outreach, presentations, administrative tasks, night safety escorts, and social media.</p>
<p>"Working with the officers really solidified my interest," he said.</p>
<p>The events in Ferguson, Baltimore, and other cities - which have put police officer use-of-force under immense scrutiny - have been opportunities for discussions within the campus department.</p>
<p>"I think law enforcement exists to counteract the negative impacts of crime so people can have a good quality of life," he said. "Law enforcement shouldn't be put on a pedestal, but people should understand it's necessary for society."</p>
<p>UCSC Police Chief Nader Oweis began hosting an early morning workout class on the East Field two years ago to help students get prepared for the physical examination.<br/>
 He said the students often help give the department a student perspective, which is helpful in deciding which programs and services to offer.</p>
<p>"The police ambassadors are a great asset to the Police Department and the UC Santa Cruz community," Oweis said. "The program allows Police Department staff to coach and mentor students and to teach them transferable skills that they can use in their future careers."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e4e5ddcf807270172b238cce3cb8a185"><name>excellence-in-teaching</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Eight faculty members honored with Excellence in Teaching awards</title><summary>The Excellence in Teaching Awards given each year by the UC Santa Cruz Academic Senate Committee on Teaching are among the highest honors faculty members can receive.

The awards honor instructors who have demonstrated exemplary and inspiring teaching.<br/>
<br/>
 Students make the nominations and more than 200 were received this year. Eight faculty members from the arts, engineering, humanities, sciences, and social sciences were selected for their inspirational teaching.</p>
<p>The awards include a $500 prize, with the exception of the Ron Ruby Award for Teaching Excellence in the Physical and Biological Sciences, which includes a $750 prize. Nominees are also asked to submit a personal statement on their teaching philosophies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent teaching is a core value at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Chancellor Blumenthal said at the June 8 luncheon when the awards were presented. &#8220;It's central to the student experience.&#8221; It&#8217;s not either/or, he said. &#8220;UCSC values research and teaching, and we do both exceedingly well.&#8221;</p>
<p>The winners of the Excellence in Teaching Award for 2015 are:</p>
<p><strong>Grace Pe&#241;a Delgado</strong><br/>
 <em>Associate professor of history</em><br/>
 Grace Pe&#241;a Delgado wrote that she never imagined herself as a university professor but now finds that &#8220;teaching is not about instructing or imparting information to students as if their minds were empty vessels waiting to be filled with knowledge. Rather,&#8221; she wrote, &#8220;teaching means empowering students to be active agents in their learning, inspiring courage to grow intellectually, cultivating curiosity, and co-producing course content.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Cormac Flanagan</strong><br/>
 <em>Professor of computer science</em><br/>
 Cormac Flanagan teaches at all levels of the computer science curriculum and said he considers teaching his most important responsibility at UC Santa Cruz. One student wrote, &#8220;He has bent over backwards to share this passion and ensure that his students understand the material. By far the best computer science professor on campus.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Craig Haney</strong><br/>
 <em>Professor of psychology</em><br/>
 Craig Haney is one of the most respected social psychologists in the country, with expertise in the criminal justice system, capital punishment, and the psychological effects of incarceration. Students remarked on Haney's ability to help them see things in new ways&#8212;and to get involved in improving the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>&#8221;There is no other professional activity that I find more enjoyable or rewarding than teaching,&#8221; Haney wrote. He boiled down teaching excellence to four components: passion for the subject matter; realism, bringing the real world into the classroom; rigor (he assigns so much reading he said he is surprised to be nominated for teaching excellence); and finally, empowerment, leaving students with a sense of direction and confidence to make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Christine Hong</strong><br/>
 <em>Assistant professor of literature</em><br/>
 In a supporting letter, literature chair Carla Freccero wrote that Christine Hong&#8217;s teaching &#8220;demonstrates tireless commitment, rigor and dedication to student achievement and especially to the success and flourishing of underrepresented students&#8212;and thus diversity&#8212;at UCSC.&#8221;</p>
<p>A student nominator wrote, &#8220;I hope UCSC recognizes Christine for her knowledge, her scholarship, and for her humanity. She's the kind of teacher who inspires me to be a better human and the best teacher I can be.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Irene Lusztig</strong><br/>
 <em>Associate professor of film and digital media</em>&lt;<br/>
 When I teach,&#8221; Irene Lusztig wrote, &#8220;I encourage my students&#8211;at both the undergraduate and graduate levels&#8211;to understand their own production practice in a critical or historical framework: It&#8217;s a priority for me to make sure my students understand that theory and practice are deeply intertwined.&#8221; Her students responded. One wrote, &#8220;She is an invaluable resource to the students in the Film and Digital Media Department and exemplifies the care, attention, and commitment that is excellence in teaching.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Mark Massoud</strong><br/>
 <em>Assistant professor of politics</em><br/>
 In his letter of nomination, politics chair Ronnie Lipschutz noted several of the strategies Mark Massoud uses: role playing, in-class debate, student presentations, and guest lectures. In his own letter written with the benefit of six years of hindsight, Massoud wrote to himself as a new teacher. He offered assurance that "everything will be fine," and outlined five tips for success: be accessible, authentic, and fearless in your teaching; appreciate diverse learning styles; reward and revel in the students' hard work; be humble and allow yourself to be humbled by your colleagues, teaching assistants, and students; and set an example that your students and you can believe in.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph Quinn</strong><br/>
 <em>Lecturer in psychology</em><br/>
 In a statement on the four elements of excellence in teaching, Ralph Quinn recalled a teacher of his in college whose love of the subject matter and ability to communicate it was foremost.&#160; &#8220;Masterful teachers have both a command of their subject matter and the facility to discuss it with eloquence,&#8221; Quinn said. &#8220;They are both scholars and communicators.&#8221; High standards and an openness to students &#8211; a humanness complete the list.</p>
<p><strong>Adriane Steinacker</strong><br/>
 <em>Lecturer in astronomy and astrophysics</em><br/>
 Adriane Steinacker is the recipient of the Ron Ruby Award for Teaching Excellence in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. &#8220;Professor Steinacker is 100 percent committed to the excellence of her students,&#8221; one student wrote. &#8220;She is extremely encouraging and has given me, and many others who I have talked to, a love of physics, and a better understanding of the natural world around us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My students&#8217; progress and success in my classes and, most importantly, their ultimate success is the fuel that sustains my momentum,&#8221; Steinacker wrote in her statement on teaching. &#8220;I am humbled by the gratitude they expressed in nominating me.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e93c99c0807270172b238cce1957d454"><name>staff-performance-appraisals</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Call for 2014-15 staff performance appraisals</title><summary>Annual performance appraisals are an essential tool for effective management of employees.

They are required for all university career staff employees.&#160; Ideally, the performance appraisal process should be a positive, reflective activity that comprehensively summarizes the ongoing discussions between the supervisor and employee that have occurred during the year. To do their best, staff members want to know that their contributions are recognized and acknowledged. This process is also the time to update the job description, discuss goals, plan future work, and establish an employee development plan that supports job specific skills and career aspirations.</p>
<p>Appraisals for the 2014-15 review period must be submitted to the appropriate Staff Human Resources <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/contact/locate_team.html" moz-do-not-send="true" target="_blank">Employee &amp; Labor Relations (ELR) Analyst</a> by Monday, August 24, 2015.&#160; Managers who are scheduled to leave for the summer months or who supervise staff on summer furloughs, should complete their performance appraisals in June to meet the August 24, 2015 deadline.</p>
<p>Staff Human Resources provides the following resources to support managers and supervisors in completing the appraisals:</p>
<p>Your division may choose to designate one or more specific forms to be used, depending on the job responsibilities for employees being reviewed. Standardized appraisal forms are provided at: <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/procedures/performance_sup/index.html" moz-do-not-send="true" target="_blank">http://shr.ucsc.edu/procedures/performance_sup/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>Your <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/contact/locate_team.html">ELR Analyst</a> can provide you with advice and assistance in writing performance appraisals and consultation in advance of the official appraisal meeting with employees. We expect managers and supervisors to consult with their ELR Analyst when writing a performance appraisal that is less than satisfactory or if performance issues exist</p>

 <br/>
There are no parking fee increases at this time. <br/>
 <br/>
Annual parking permits and staff/faculty Metro bus passes expire on June 30, 2015. Staff and faculty who need to renew their parking permit or bus pass for 2015-16 can apply on-line now (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://basx2.ucsc.edu/application2015/">http://basx2.ucsc.edu/application2015/</a>), or in person at the TAPS Sales Office. <br/>
 <br/>
Staff and faculty with multi-year parking permits do not need to reapply in order to continue using their permit, unless they want to select a different type of permit or want to purchase a 2015-16 Metro bus pass. If you are unsure if you have a multi-year permit you can compare it to the online permit samples at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/parking/parking-permits/multi-year-permit-sample.html">http://taps.ucsc.edu/parking/parking-permits/multi-year-permit-sample.html</a>.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>Larry Pageler, Director, Transportation and Parking Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f9067ba1807270172b238cce029b9b0d"><name>graduate-adviser</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Graduate to help urban teens find path to college</title><summary>Brittany Alba is poised to help many other Californians follow her path to higher education by serving a two-year fellowship that will have her advising San Jose high school students.</summary><start-date>1434402000000</start-date><display-name>Graduate to help urban teens find path to college</display-name><path>/2015/06/graduate-adviser</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/graduate-adviser</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1434402061185</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1435269117744</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/graduate-adviser-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/graduate-adviser-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>graduate-adviser-500px.jpg</name><display-name>graduate-adviser-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>137237</file-size><width>500</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/graduate-adviser-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/graduate-adviser-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>graduate-adviser-80px.jpg</name><display-name>graduate-adviser-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>11685</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Brittany Alba</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As a high school senior in San Diego, Brittany Alba accepted an invitation from the UC Santa Cruz student-outreach program <a href="http://www.engagingeducation.org/outreach/a-step-forward-asf/">A Step Forward</a> to see the campus firsthand.</p>
<p>After setting foot on campus, seeing its stunning landscape and hearing more about the community, Alba decided to enroll.</p>
<p>Four years later, the first-generation college student graduated from Oakes College with a degree in neuroscience with a minor in bioinformatics and is poised to help many other Californians follow her path to higher education.</p>
<p>"I know a lot of students come from a similar background as me," she said. "If they see someone else from their community made it, it can be something powerful for them."</p>
<p>Though Alba was drawn to UC Santa Cruz by the opportunity to pursue science, she's always believed teaching was her calling. Alba will spend the next two years in a fellowship with UC Berkeley's Destination College Advising Corps, encouraging and advising about 1,800 Oak Grove High School students in San Jose. She'll be a source for information about colleges, financial aid, testing and more.</p>
<p>Alba will be working with a diverse student body that's comprised of many first-generation college students who may not be thinking of college as an option for them.</p>
<p>When she arrived on campus, she immediately got involved with the Filipino Student Association and <a href="http://www.engagingeducation.org">Engaging Education</a> (e2), a student-initiated outreach and retention center for student engagement and academic excellence.</p>
<p>She started as a coordinator for the Kuya-Ate Mentorship Program (KAMP), a big brother/sister program that creates and strengthens the bond formed within smaller communities or "families." Her involvement continue to grow and by 2013, she was serving as a co-chair for Engaging Education.</p>
<p>"What's really special about Engaging Education is that they really let students grow and flourish," she said.</p>
<p>While at UC Santa Cruz, Alba was able to take time to evaluate some of her beliefs and change her way of thinking. During her second year, she was challenged by a mentor to explore why she had anxiety and low self-esteem.</p>
<p>Alba decided to go two quarters without thinking about her appearance. She left her makeup on the counter and kept her hair in a ponytail.</p>
<p>"I was forced to focus on what I was good at and to focus on what made me me," she said. "It was a big turning point."</p>
<p>This is just a minor example of the ways student organizing began changing Alba's perspective and self-views.</p>
<p>Sayo Fujioka, director of Student Organization Advising and Resources (SOAR), said Alba challenged herself to learn complex skills such as facilitation, project management, and leading workshops.</p>
<p>"She built truly collaborative working relations with staff and other student leaders," Fujioka said. "Through her work with e2 and the SOMeCA office, Brittany mentored hundreds of new student leaders."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f962ce8e807270172b238cce3da78804"><name>commencement-2015-feature-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Freshly minted grads revel at commencement</title><summary>Bubbles floated in the air and fresh-flower leis ruffled in the breeze as scholars and their supporters gathered over the weekend for a very special edition of UC Santa Cruz commencement. </summary><start-date>1434407940000</start-date><display-name>Commencement 2015 Feature</display-name><path>/2015/06/commencement-2015-feature-story</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/commencement-2015-feature-story</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1434408111400</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1435090973490</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="248" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EtMiDsH0wI" width="440"></iframe></embed><width>440</width><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/sociology friends, commencement350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/sociology friends, commencement350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sociology friends, commencement350.jpg</name><display-name>sociology friends, commencement350.jpg</display-name><file-size>47843</file-size><width>350</width><height>310</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/sociology friends thumbnail 80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/sociology friends thumbnail 80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sociology friends thumbnail 80.jpg</name><display-name>sociology friends thumbnail 80.jpg</display-name><file-size>17128</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p>Tracy Perkins and Yvonne Kwan wait to receive their Ph.D certificates.

<p>In the graduate division, 77 doctoral degrees were awarded for summer, fall, and winter; another 99 candidates have applied for spring Ph.D. degrees.</p>
<p>Every one of those degrees is a story of determination, sacrifice, life changes, and hard work.</p>
<p>Tracy Perkins, 35, on the verge of receiving her Ph.D. in sociology, could hardly believe it was happening; she had been working toward this goal for nine years&#8212;seven as a Ph.D candidate, and two years in pursuit of her master's degree.</p>
<p>Perkins, who studied environmental sociology and social movements, and researched social justice activism, loved teaching undergraduates, an experience that bolstered her even when her research was daunting. "They were learning sponges," she said of her students.</p>
<p>While she's thrilled to be heading off to Howard University in Washington, D.C., where she will be an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology, leaving UC Santa Cruz is bittersweet. "I just taught my last class here on Wednesday!" she said, adding that it was hard to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Walking beside Perkins was her friend Yvonne Kwan, who was beaming&#8212;and for good reason. Now that she's received her Ph.D. in sociology after six years of work, she will head off to Dartmouth College as a postdoctoral fellow in September. Out of more than 1,700 applicants, only five were selected for this position.</p>
<p>Graduates, aside from reveling in their accomplishments, also had a chance to learn from Slugs who passed through the same forested campus years ago.</p>
<p>An array of high-profile alumni speakers greeted the graduates this year including NPR science correspondent Joe Palca ( Ph.D. '82, psychology) and two Pulitzer Prize winners&#8212;H&#233;ctor Tobar (Oakes '88, Latin American/Latino studies and sociology), and Martha Mendoza (Kresge '88, individual major).</p>
<p>Palca exhorted the graduates to ask questions, listen, and be persistent. "When you're done, stop talking," he advised. He also counseled grads to remember their humanity and appreciate what they've learned.</p>
<p>"So I know there are people in this audience who are thinking, 'Great&#8230;now I am the world's expert in the "Dietary Ecology of Coastal Coyotes," or "The Politics of Socialist Athletics in the People's Republic of China, 1949-1966," or "Effects of Cold Ambient Temperature on Human Sleep, Metabolism, and Thermoregulation,"'" Palca said. "Will this do me much good in the real world? Forget about the specifics. You've learned how to tackle a problem and wrestle it to the ground."</p>
<p>Tobar, addressing College Nine, reflected on the remarkable natural beauty of UC Santa Cruz, and lost himself in the nostalgia of the moment.</p>
<p>"My own daughter, who I brought to this campus &#8230; when she was 7 years old, stood by one of the buildings, underneath a grove of towering redwoods, and asked the very simple but obvious question: 'Pap&#225;, why did they put a college in the forest?' I thought about this question for a moment, and answered: 'Because it's a good place to concentrate, and to think big thoughts.'"</p>
<p>Time, and the timelessness of his education and college experience, was very much on Tobar's mind.</p>
<p>"One day in the future, you too will be at a place that's far from here, and you too will realize how much your UC Santa Cruz self, and the college community in which you lived, are still with you," he continued.</p>
<p>Mendoza, addressing the Kresge crowd, blended inspiration with good old-fashioned hard-nosed advice.</p>
<p>"A child knows right and wrong," she said. "But justice, that's more complex. You've got to be conscious, present, looking for injustice and shouting it out."</p>
<p>She added that grads should show up on time&#8212;always. "Every single day," she emphasized. "Not five minutes late. No excuses. Be there on time. Ready to go. Year in and year out."</p>
<p>John Laird (Stevenson '72, politics), California's Secretary for Natural Resources and one of the nation's first openly gay mayors, had a simple, direct, and effective message for the Cowell College crowd: Pay it forward and be bold.</p>
<p>"When I graduated from UCSC, it was illegal to be gay in all 50 states," Laird said. "When I sat at my graduation, I was just coming to terms with the fact that I was gay. And I thought I would have to choose between being clear about who I was, and moving ahead in the field of public policy that I thought I was best suited for.</p>
<p>"I took a risk," Laird continued, "not knowing whether I was on the right side of history&#8212;but knowing I was doing what was right."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.flickr.com/photos/ucsantacruz/sets/72157654118456990</url><title>Photos: our favorites from commencement ceremonies</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://storify.com/ucsc/uc-santa-cruz-commencement-2015</url><title>Grad stories: our favorite commencement posts from #ucscalumni </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="08f2a1fd807270172b238cce32cdd5ad"><name>reading-list</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Social Sciences division launches first annual summer reading list  </title><summary>What happens when you ask UC Santa Cruz faculty, staff, alumni, and students from the Division of Social Sciences - and even the Chancellor - for book recommendations related to themes of social justice, citizenship, ethics, and social responsibility?</summary><start-date>1434669120000</start-date><display-name>Summer reading list</display-name><path>/2015/06/reading-list</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/reading-list</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1434669195718</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1434669882906</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Opinion</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdwitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/ucsc-reads-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/ucsc-reads-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ucsc-reads-450.jpg</name><display-name>ucsc-reads-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>127609</file-size><width>450</width><height>606</height></image><image-alt>book cover graphic</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/ucsc-reads-text1-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/ucsc-reads-text1-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ucsc-reads-text1-80.jpg</name><display-name>ucsc-reads-text1-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>24875</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>book cover graphic</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The reading list includes diverse titles selected by faculty, students, staff, and even the chancellor.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>What happens when you ask UC Santa Cruz faculty, staff, alumni, and students from the Division of Social Sciences - and even the Chancellor - for book recommendations related to themes of social justice, citizenship, ethics, and social responsibility?</p>

<p>The Graduate Commons governance board announced in October that the contract for Joe&#8217;s Pizza and Subs, which had operated at the location since 2003, was up at the end of the academic year and that it would seek a new operator. Requests for Interest (RFIs) were sent today to 35 potential restaurant operators with a deadline of July 2 to respond.</p>
<p>A restaurant subcommittee will whittle the list to a handful, said Rachel Neuman, business and building manager for the commons. Those potential vendors will be invited to submit proposals with more details &#8211; a business vision, menu selections, experience, and financials. Neuman said the committee hopes to have a new operator in place by the beginning of fall quarter.</p>
<p>Crews are already deep cleaning the space, painting, repairing refrigeration, and replacing some appliances, Neuman said.&#160; The successful bidder will also have the opportunity to specify additional equipment as part of negotiations.</p>
<p>Top potential vendors will be able to tour the space in about a month. Requests for proposals are due August 5.

<p>UC Santa Cruz was a place of the mind in 1965, and, to a large degree, a place still in the mind; so much of what we now know as the college campus did not exist yet.</p>
<p>But the spirit of adventure, and the willingness to follow an ever-changing road map, united UC Santa Cruz's very first graduating class and the faculty and staff members who helped guide their way to graduation. The founding vision of UC Santa Cruz was grounded in a solid liberal arts education with a multidisciplinary focus. It was also centered around small residential colleges, as well as faculty members who prided themselves on their ability to challenge the young students while taking their ideas seriously.</p>
<p>This winter, <em>UC Santa Cruz Review</em> set up a "roundtable" of voices from the past and present to reflect on the campus turning 50 years old in 2015. They talked about the many changes they've witnessed, and the ways the place has stayed true to its multidisciplinary and idealistic original vision.</p>
<p><em>The following is a combination of several in-depth phone interviews with the subjects. Dan White's questions are in bold.&#160;</em></p>
<p>Our roundtablers include:</p>
<p>&#8226; Economics professor <strong>David Kaun,</strong> a faculty member since 1966</p>
<p>&#8226;&#160;Pioneer students <strong>Jock Reynolds</strong> (Stevenson '69, psychology), a renowned artist and museum director; <strong>Michael Gerber</strong> (Cowell '69, economics), a professor in UC Santa Barbara's Graduate School of Education, and his wife, <strong>Kathy Gerber</strong> (Stevenson '69, psychology), a retired teacher (the two met while working together on UC Santa Cruz's first ever yearbook); and <strong>Meg Zweiback</strong> (Merrill '69, politics), a pediatric nurse practitioner and author</p>
<p>&#8226; Staff members <strong>Katherine Beiers,</strong> a retired UC Santa Cruz librarian who worked at McHenry Library from 1967 to 1992; and retired housing administrator <strong>Jerry Walters</strong></p>
<h3>Breaking ground</h3>
<p><strong>There was a strong sense of breaking new ground, not just on the physical campus but also in the classrooms.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Gerber:</strong> It was like living in a forest. It was a beautiful setting and there was no history. Now the campus has institutional traditions you learn about, and there are also upperclassmen. Your behavior as a first-year is mapped against what you see other people doing. The university has rules and procedures, but when we got there, there was not much of that. Everything we were in contact with was being created on the spot. Cowell College was established as countercultural, an explicit experiment: How can you have a small liberal arts college embedded in a university? There were some upperclassmen, and about 100 or so transfer juniors, but they didn't live on campus. We generally didn't see them.</p>
<p><strong>It's hard for me to even imagine attending a school with all those earthmovers and a bunch of un-built structures. I think the risk would have been too much for me to handle. I would have thought, "I don't know about this. What if this new campus is going to shut down next week?"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerry Walters:</strong> But I think you're coming at this through today's eyes, and you aren't looking at the situation from the perspective of a 17- or 18-year-old. People were more rugged then. The faculty were young, too. And everybody was in the same situation, all new, all excited, coming to a new experiment.</p>
<p><strong>David Kaun:</strong> When I got here, initially in February of 1966, the physical buildings of Cowell and Stevenson (respectively, the first and second colleges constructed on campus) did not exist. It was exciting. There were 600 students, and we added another 600 with Stevenson. I had an intro course on economics, and we had four students.</p>
<p><strong>Jock Reynolds:</strong> There would be chairs and tables in the Field House and they would empty it out to hold a big World Civilization course, and empty it out again to have a meal, and empty it out again and play basketball. We were making it up as we went along.</p>
<p><strong>Meg Zweiback:</strong> At the end of the year, we had a huge comprehensive exam covering everything over the year from three quarters. Lots of people flunked the test. They hadn't figured out that if you flunked you didn't get credit for 15 units, which meant you were out. I read Bertrand Russell's History of Western Philosophy and crammed in 20 unread books, starting with Plato, in one weekend and passed! UC Santa Cruz was teaching us to think "big picture" and to create themes and to ask questions so if you were (only) a dutiful student and did your work and did not have an inquiring mind you wouldn't do as well.</p>
<p><strong>That's a lot of learning in a small amount of time! Did you retain a lot of what you learned?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meg Zweiback:</strong> Yes, because the professors, including Mary Holmes in art, had a great gift for making you see things you hadn't noticed before. I can still tell you more about medieval architecture than what I learned when I first went to Europe.</p>
<h3>Counterculture revolution</h3>
<p><strong>This was the mid-1960s before the counterculture really caught fire, before the Summer of Love. Often when people think "'60s," they impose this image that started later on.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerry Walters:</strong> Well, let's put it this way. While they may have looked a lot different when they graduated from here, they arrived clean-shaven, with haircuts and nice clothes. Those were such different times. In those days there was this idea of "In Loco Parentis," where the university was thought to be a parent in a way. As an example, our chancellor had students sign in or out so if parents wanted to find their son or daughter, all they had to do was call the preceptor. They would call up and say, "I haven't heard from my son for a while. Where is he?" We were so small, we could get in touch with people quickly. Well, that didn't go over well. A lot of students rebelled after a while. "This is our time, in our lives, and we will keep in touch with our folks (when we want to)."</p>
<p><strong>David Kaun:</strong> Stevenson used to have two sets of dormitories: one quad for men, the other for women. After the first year they realized the quad with four dorms of men turned out to be barbaric, so in the second year they intermingled the dormitories, and by the fourth year students could go into each other's dormitories through the first-floor lounge. Every single year the dormitory policy changed. It was not very long before men and women were living on the same floors. It was difficult for parents to come there. "Wait a minute! There's your room, and there are girls next door?" Not the kind of college their parents went to.</p>
<h3>Larger than life founders</h3>
<p><strong>Maybe it's because of the iconic photos: Page Smith riding a horse through campus, and Chancellor McHenry posing at a desk on an empty field, but I think of the founding figures as larger than life in those days.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katherine Beiers:</strong> When I was going to the University of Southern California, I'd read a two-volume book about John Adams by (the late historian, professor, and founding Cowell College provost) Page Smith, and those were two of the best books I'd ever read. When I moved up to Santa Cruz I had no idea he was here, that he was a professor. One day I was working on a Sunday afternoon and he called to see if we had a certain book. Normally you don't just check the stacks when people call (they, of course, had no computerized inventory of books). But this was Page Smith, so I got him the book. He rode into the big foyer of the library, where the caf&#233; is now. I gave him his book. I checked out the book, and handed to him, and off he went on his horse. I did not make that up.</p>
<h3>Town and gown</h3>
<p><strong>I would imagine that UC Santa Cruz's presence in the sleepy city of Santa Cruz changed the way of life here dramatically by the end of the '60s.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Gerber:</strong> You have to try to imagine Pacific Avenue (Santa Cruz's famous "main drag") as an old-fashioned downtown much like Soledad or Watsonville with a single movie theater, one large department store, and a bunch of small shops, a sleepy place. In 1965 it was sleepy; there wasn't much of a youth culture presence, and all of a sudden there were 500 freshmen roaming through downtown; that changed the place instantly.</p>
<p><strong>It seems to me that the social consciousness that people still associate with UC Santa Cruz&#8212; in part because of students' Peace Corps participation&#8212;was just taking shape then, and had as much to do with the campus's vision as it had to do with the foment of the '60s.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kathy Gerber:</strong> Because I was involved with social sciences, we felt a great need to be involved in making the world a better place to be, and part of the social movement but also exercise our intellectual commitment. We wanted to choose a route in the world that would affect people in the world positively. Part of that was a product of the time, part of that was the social milieu of Santa Cruz, and part of it was the passion of the people we were meeting on campus and in town.</p>
<h3>Original spirit</h3>
<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz has expanded over time. And it's changed in many ways. I know that many founding faculty were upset about the original narrative evaluations becoming supplementary when grades were instituted for all students in 2001. But I was hoping you could reflect on ways that the "original" UC Santa Cruz remains visible or recognizable in the current campus.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jock Reynolds:</strong> I've been back there enough to think the spirit of the place is in many ways very much intact though you don't expect everything to remain in stasis.</p>
<p><strong>And how does your experience at UC Santa Cruz continue to reverberate with you in your life?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jock Reynolds:</strong> I was just thrilled to get into UC Santa Cruz, and I loved every minute of it. During my senior year, they brought a huge number of amazingly important visiting artists. John Cage, Allan Kapro, George Segal, and (international avant-garde art movement member) Robert Watts.</p>
<strong>Meg Zweiback:</strong> My husband and I are 50 years out of college. We both hit 65. Neither of us plans to retire because we do things we enjoy. We're still interested in what we do, and that comes from our education. What UC Santa Cruz did for us&#8212;and this was very deliberate&#8212;was start with these big broad survey courses and then these small seminars that gave us intimate connections with faculty members who cared to probe and explore what we callow children had to say, these brilliant faculty people who thought we were worth investing in.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0d872bbf807270172b238cce5be49203"><name>game-finder</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz team introduces new web-based tools for finding videogames</title><summary>The proliferation of videogames has created a "discoverability" problem for game enthusiasts and others, but help is now just a click away.</summary><keywords>Center for Games and Playable Media, CGPM, Noah Wardrip-Fruin, GameNet, GameSage, computer games, videogames</keywords><start-date>1434987000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz team introduces new web-based tools for finding videogames</display-name><path>/2015/06/game-finder</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/game-finder</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1434746039188</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1435008733439</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computational Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Library</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/game-sage-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/game-sage-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>game-sage-400.jpg</name><display-name>game-sage-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>43199</file-size><width>400</width><height>334</height></image><image-alt>GameSage screen shot</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/game-sage-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/game-sage-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>game-sage-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>game-sage-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16857</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>GameSage screen shot</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>GameSage allows users to describe a hypothetical videogame and get a list of the existing games that are closest to the description.</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/games-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/games-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>games-400.jpg</name><display-name>games-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>97400</file-size><width>400</width><height>260</height></image><image-alt>games on library shelf</image-alt><image-caption><p>The UC Santa Cruz Library has thousands of video games in its collections. (Photo by Christy Caldwell)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The extraordinary proliferation of videogames over the past decade has created a "discoverability" problem for game enthusiasts and others, but help is now just a click away thanks to two new web-based tools developed at the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/">Center for Games and Playable Media</a>. UCSC researchers will introduce the new tools in a talk and a demonstration session at the <a href="http://www.foundationsofdigitalgames.org/">2015 Foundations of Digital Games</a> conference in Pacific Grove, California, on June 24.</p>
<p><a href="http://gamecip-projects.soe.ucsc.edu/gamenet">GameNet</a> and <a href="http://gamecip-projects.soe.ucsc.edu/gamesage">GameSage</a> were designed not only for game players looking to find new games suited to their individual tastes, but also for game designers, teachers, and scholars, said Noah Wardrip-Fruin, a professor of computational media at UC Santa Cruz. GameNet is an explorable network that allows users to enter the name of a game and get an interactive list of closely related games. GameSage is integrated with GameNet and allows users to describe a hypothetical game (or a game they can't remember the name of) and find the existing games that are closest to the description.</p>
<p>"If you're a game designer with an idea for a new game, you'd like to know what else is out there that's similar. There haven't been any good tools for doing that," Wardrip-Fruin said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Latent semantic analysis</strong></p>
<p>UCSC computer science graduate students James Ryan and Eric Kaltman led the development of GameNet and GameSage, with Wardrip-Fruin and Michael Mateas, professor and chair of computational media, as their primary advisers. Both tools are based on an analysis of Wikipedia articles describing nearly 12,000 games. The team used a natural language processing technique called "latent semantic analysis" to analyze the game descriptions and compute relatedness scores.</p>
<p>For each game in the network, GameNet provides a summary of the game extracted from Wikipedia, along with links to the Wikipedia entry, Google Images, and YouTube videos of the game. There are color-coded, interactive listings of related games and, just in case you're looking for something completely different, a list of the most disparate or unrelated games.</p>
<p>"We tried to make it informative and easy to use, so you can quickly see if a game interests you," Wardrip-Fruin said.</p>
<p>The team plans to continue adding games to the network, drawing from at least one other source in addition to Wikipedia. "There are very few notable commercial games that our system doesn't include, although we don't yet have any games released after 2014 because we extracted the Wikipedia text last year," Ryan said.</p>
<p>GameNet and GameSage were developed as part of a larger project, the <a href="https://gamecip.soe.ucsc.edu/">Game Metadata and Citation Project</a> (GAMECIP), funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. GAMECIP is a multi-year joint initiative involving the UC Santa Cruz Library, UCSC Center for Games and Playable Media, and Stanford University Library to improve library and institutional practice for computer games.</p>
<p>"All the infrastructure we have for books and films has been lacking for games," Wardrip-Fruin said. "We're trying to improve all aspects of how we find games, how we add them to collections in libraries, archives, and museums, and how we cite them in academic literature."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1cf446f4807270172b238cce1f570203"><name>robert-sinsheimer</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Robert Sinsheimer: sequencing the human genome</title><start-date>1434956400000</start-date><display-name>Robert Sinsheimer: sequencing the human genome</display-name><path>/2015/06/robert-sinsheimer</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/robert-sinsheimer</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1435004847836</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1435621781355</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/sinsheimer.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/sinsheimer.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sinsheimer.jpg</name><file-size>30867</file-size><width>300</width><height>422</height></image><image-alt>Robert Sinsheimer</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/sinsheimer-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/sinsheimer-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sinsheimer-thumb.jpg</name><file-size>3284</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Robert Sinsheimer</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Robert Sinsheimer</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In May 1985, molecular biologist and UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Robert Sinsheimer shared with a group of eminent biologists a radical proposal to launch a massive project to determine the complete DNA sequence of the human genome.</p>
<p>The technological challenges were daunting, but Sinsheimer recognized that knowledge of the human genome would have profound implications for biomedical science. Although he was unable to secure funding for it at the time, the meeting planted the idea of sequencing the human genome within a core group of scientists. Five years later, the Human Genome Project was officially launched with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>In 1999, project leaders asked David Haussler, then a professor of computer science and now director of the UCSC Genomics Institute, to help with the analysis of the human genome. Before that work could start, however, the genome sequence had to be assembled from fragmented data generated by the project's sequencing laboratories. This unexpectedly challenging task was accomplished by Jim Kent, then a UCSC graduate student, who wrote the computer program used to assemble the first working draft of the human genome sequence. Kent finished the assembly in June 2000, just days before this landmark achievement was announced at a White House press conference.</p>
<p>In 2001, Sinsheimer received the UC Presidential Medal at a ceremony during the UC Santa Cruz Human Genome Symposium, which brought together many of the original participants in the 1985 Santa Cruz Workshop, along with NIH's Francis Collins and other leaders of the Human Genome Project.</p>

 To: UCSC Faculty and Staff<br/>
 From: Associate Chancellor Ashish Sahni, Locally Designated Official for Whistleblower Matters<br/>
 Re: California Whistleblower Protection Act- Annual Notice<br/>
<br/>
 The University of California is committed to maintaining the highest standards of conduct in the fulfillment of its education, research, public service and patient care mission. The University&#8217;s Whistleblower Policy provides multiple avenues for employees to bring forward concerns of potential employee misconduct. Faculty and staff are encouraged to bring forward concerns about possible improper governmental activity directly to their supervisor, department head, Locally Designated Official (LDO) or other appropriate university offices or officials.<br/>
<br/>
 The University established a systemwide independently operated whistleblower hotline to allow for calls or web-based reporting from faculty, staff and students with a provision for anonymous reporting. The hotline relays the reported concerns to appropriate university officials for processing. This hotline is staffed seven days a week, 24 hours per day and is capable of receiving reports in a number of different languages.<br/>
<br/>
 The university-wide toll-free number is 1-800-403-4744.&#160; Web-based reports can be made by accessing <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://universityofcalifornia.edu/hotline">http://universityofcalifornia.edu/hotline</a>. More information about the whistleblower process can be found on the <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/uc-whistleblower/index.html" target="_blank">UC Whistleblower website</a>, the <a href="http://whistleblower.ucsc.edu/index.html" target="_blank">UCSC Whistleblower website</a> and on posters displayed in various employee areas. The university&#8217;s whistleblower poster identifies other channels for reporting improper governmental activity, including the California State Auditor, the California Attorney General and locations for reporting fraud and abuse involving federal programs.<br/>
<br/>
 The California Government Code requires every state agency, including the University of California, to annually distribute to its employees a message from the California State Auditor that provides an explanation of the California Whistleblower Protection Act. The 2015 CA State Auditor&#8217;s Message can also be found here: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://whistleblower.ucsc.edu/about/csa-memo2015.pdf">http://whistleblower.ucsc.edu/about/csa-memo2015.pdf</a></span><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"><br face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"/>

<p>Thirty-six college women's basketball coaches from across the country completed the invitation-only, two-and-a-half day elite leadership program. Kent was the one of the seven Division III coaches invited to take part in the program.</p>
<p>Using resources of Columbia University and the Women's Basketball Coaches Association, The Center for Coaching Excellence utilized collaborative and interaction learning sessions, along with lectures and panel discussions featuring experts in college athletics, in addressing some of the most pressing issues in college women's basketball while also establishing valuable networking opportunities with their peers and top industry leaders.</p>
<p>A member of the WBCA, Kent completed his fifth year at the helm of the Slugs' program in 2014-15.</p>
<p>"The event is designed to help coaches develop a better understanding of how to be true to themselves. With the assistance of skilled facilitators and other coaches, we spent three days creating a game plan to identify our personal strengths and weaknesses and how to capitalize on that knowledge to benefit our student-athletes,"Kent said.</p>
<p>Coaches attending the June 8-10 session included Kyle Adams of Cheyney University of Pennsylvania (II), Tennille Adams of Howard University (I), Jana Ashley of Clarion University (II), Fala Bullock of Armstrong State University (II), Jennifer Carleton of the University of Bridgeport (II), Anne Crutchfield of Emory &amp; Henry College (III), Susan Darling of Northern Arizona University (I), Brian Donoghue of King's College (Pennsylvania) (II), Brianna Finch of New Mexico Highlands University (II), Juli Fulks of Transylvania University (III), Molly Goodenbour of California State University-Dominguez Hills (II), Lauren Hall-Gregory of New York University (III), Jenerrie Harris of the University of Massachusetts Lowell (I), Kiley Hill of Valdosta State University (II), Ron Hughey of the University of Houston (I), Heather Jacobs of Adelphi University (II), Todd Kent of the University of California &#8211; Santa Cruz (II), Tim LaKose of the Dominican University of California (II), Tina Martin of the University of Delaware (I), Caroline McCombs of Stony Brook University (I), Cassandra Moorer of Stillman College (II), Alisha Mosley of Washington College (III), Allison Nichols of Randolph College (III), James Oliver Jr. of Bluefield State College (II), Katie Pate of Lenoir-Rhyne University (II), JJ Riehl of St. Edward's University (II), Kristen Rogers of Lake Superior State University (II), Carter Shaw of California State University-Los Angeles (II), David Slifer of the University of Central Missouri (II), Charlotte Smith of Elon University (I), Jennifer Smith of Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania (II), Polly Thomason of the University of Texas at Dallas (III), Tom Webb of Cameron University (II), Jaida Williams of Coastal Carolina University (I), Stephanie Yelton of the University of West Florida (II) and Mark Zacher of Norwich University (III).</p>
<p>Dr. Cathie T. Siders, a clinical psychologist, organizational consultant and executive coach, facilitated group-learning sessions. Other sessions featured panel discussions from a wide variety of leaders from both the college athletics industry and other sectors of industry.</p>

<p>While this work may cause temporary disruptions, it is critical to our ability to support and advance the UC Santa Cruz mission and to provide a safe, efficient, and functional campus. Some projects will be completed this summer, while others will take longer.</p>
<p>There's a lot going on, but it's exciting to see these projects get to this stage. I'm grateful to the talented teams that have worked behind the scenes for months&#8212;sometimes years&#8212;to bring these projects forward. Here are some of the highlights:</p>
<p><strong>Coastal Biology building at Coastal Science campus</strong><br/>
 The new Coastal Biology building will provide more than 40,000 square feet of much-needed research and teaching space for the department of Ecology and Environmental Biology and includes major improvements to the campus infrastructure. Work began in May and is slated to wrap up in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Health and Safety facility</strong><br/>
 This new building will replace the undersized, inadequate facility used for the handling and storage of hazardous waste. The 5,200-square-foot building will be located off Heller Drive and is scheduled for completion in December 2018. The project will support campus research, reduce transportation risk and cost, and increase operational efficiencies.</p>
<p><strong>Student life seismic corrections</strong><br/>
 This project will provide additional seismic strengthening to the Student Union, Redwood Building, and Cardiff House. It will also bring the facilities into compliance with accessibility standards, address major maintenance needs, and generally make the buildings more pleasant for students.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Oakes College Amphitheater</strong><br/>
 New bench seating will restore the beauty of the theater and provide space for organized activities, as well as casual interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Great Meadow bike path</strong><br/>
 To enhance safety and preserve the beauty of the path, we will recoat and restripe it.</p>
<p><strong>Stairway reconstructions</strong><br/>
 To improve safety and comply with code requirements, we will replace stairways at the Cowell Hagar bus stop, the Kerr Hall pedestrian bridge, and the Kresge pedestrian bridge. Improvements will include adding handrails and slip-resistant tread surfacing.</p>
<p><strong>Cowell and Stevenson road resurfacing</strong><br/>
 Resurfacing the Cowell/Stevenson road loop will eliminate hazards created by tree roots and potholes, beautifying the campus&#8212;and making it safer, too.</p>
<p><strong>Redwood Grove Apartment pathway replacement&#160;</strong><br/>
 Replacing pathways around the apartment complex will reduce hazards and beautify the landscape.</p>
<p><strong>McHenry Library book stack lighting upgrade</strong><br/>
 This project will provide on-demand lighting in the stacks that will automatically adjust for different levels of daylight, enhancing functionality while reducing energy use.</p>
<p><strong>Engineering complex absorption chiller installations&#160;</strong><br/>
 Replacing inefficient chillers with high-efficiency heat-driven technology will allow us to capture heat normally discharged by the central boiler plant to power the production of chilled water for cooling. This project will save money and energy.</p>
<p><strong>Thimann Laboratory air balancing&#160;&#160;</strong><br/>
 Rebalancing air circulation systems in Thimann laboratories will generate considerable energy savings.</p>
<p><strong>Redwood Grove Apartment furnace replacements</strong><br/>
 Installing new furnaces will save energy and provide more reliable heating systems for students.</p>
<p><strong>Hahn Student Services air handler replacement&#160;</strong><br/>
 Replacing inefficient units that are more than 40 years old with new technology will save energy and give building occupants more comfort control.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="20f5ab9e807270172b238cceb9e6c893"><name>bunnett-service</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Memorial service for Joseph Bunnett on Saturday, June 27</title><summary>A memorial service will be held on Saturday, June 27, for Joseph Bunnett, professor emeritus of chemistry and biochemistry.</summary><keywords>Joseph Bunnett</keywords><start-date>1435042800000</start-date><display-name>Memorial srvice for Joseph Bunnett on Saturday, June 27</display-name><path>/2015/06/bunnett-service</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/bunnett-service</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1435072048000</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1435073994559</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A memorial service celebrating the career and accomplishments of Joseph Bunnett, professor emeritus of chemistry and biochemistry, will take place on Saturday, June 27, at 3 p.m. in the Porter College Dining Hall.</p>

Binary Fission was designed as a fun and accessible way for "citizen scientists" to help increase the reliability and security of mission critical software by verifying that it is free of cyber vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>From a gaming perspective, the goal of Binary Fission is simple: sort colored atomic particles or "quarks" in as few steps as possible. Players use up to 100 filters to sort the particles into separate pools. As players move their cursor over a particular pool, they are shown in real time how successfully a particular filter would sort the quarks in that pool.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern recognition</strong></p>
<p>Binary Fission also allows more sophisticated interactions: rather than defining behavior of software elements from scratch, players can mix and match pre-made descriptions. The search for such descriptions--technically called "loop invariants"--takes advantage of visual pattern recognition that people are better at than computers.</p>
<p>"We're very excited about the play experience in Binary Fission," said lead game designer Heather Logas of UC Santa Cruz. "Informed by new research about formal software verification and inspired by the citizen science phenomenon, the game is both very playable and also should contribute well to the underlying science problem."</p>
<p>Examples of critical software behavior, along with some pre-made invariants, are used to generate each level in Binary Fission. The quarks in the game actually represent values of variables inside the critical software, and the sorting filters represent the potential invariants to be explored and applied. By combining filters efficiently, players can help to verify that the software is free of security vulnerabilities. Binary Fission also emphasizes community, an important aspect of successful citizen science projects, through integrated chat, active community management, and regular community events.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity issues</strong></p>
<p>"The auxiliary Binary Fission feature set is very light, since our goal is to keep players focused on solving problems," said John Murray, program director in the Computer Science Laboratory at SRI International and principal investigator for the overall project. "However, as a citizen science project, our recruitment policy draws in players who are interested in solving cybersecurity issues."</p>
<p>Currently, formal software verification is rarely used because relatively few people have the necessary training in verification techniques. In addition, finding loop invariants in software programs has historically been a challenging task requiring extensive training and insight.</p>
<p>"SRI is well versed in formal software verification, with over a quarter of a century spent assuring that mission-critical computer systems are error-free, secure and interoperable. We are pleased to work with our partners in DARPA's highly innovative, creative and fun program," said Patrick Lincoln, director of SRI's Computer Science Laboratory. "We learned a lot of valuable lessons with our first game of this type, Xylem. For our gaming approach to succeed, we need a more sophisticated game for a more sophisticated audience. We have leveled up our research, and with more automation, interaction and sophistication, Binary Fission is our best game yet."</p>
<p>Binary Fission is one of five games that DARPA is releasing under its Crowd-Sourced Formal Verification program. All games, including the first SRI-and-UCSC-created game, Xylem, are freely accessible through the <a href="http://www.verigames.com/">Verigames website</a>.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz and SRI are also collaborating with researchers at CEA, the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, to develop tools for software analysis and formal verification that feed into Binary Fission.</p>

The $5 million NASA grant to establish the Merced Nanomaterials Center for Energy and Sensing (MACES) includes $947,000 for UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The UCSC affiliates include Jin Zhang, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and Michael Oye, adjunct professor of electrical engineering and the UCSC co-director of the Advanced Studies Laboratories at NASA Ames Research Center. Led by UC Merced engineering professor Jennifer Lu, MACES aims to develop innovative nanotechnology solutions for space exploration missions and help develop a pipeline for highly qualified workers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Center investigators, including collaborators at UC Santa Cruz and NASA Research Centers, plan to create new materials solutions enabling high-performance, reliable, compact, and lightweight energy-conversion, storage, and sensing devices for NASA missions.</p>
<p>Zhang's lab will work on both energy conversion and chemical/biochemical sensing, the two major thrusts of the center's research program. His group will synthesize and characterize nanomaterials for photovoltaic solar cells, fabricate solar cells, and evaluate their performance. For the sensor research, Zhang's lab will develop nanomaterials for a sensor based on a platform using optical fibers and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).</p>
<p>Oye's lab will focus on the energy thrust of the proposed work. His group will synthesize and characterize metal oxide nanowires for energy harvesting devices. The Oye and Zhang labs will both contribute to the education and training of students and other outreach activities of the center. MACES will create a scholarship program to provide research opportunities for undergraduate students, particularly underrepresented students, and provide research fellowships to eight or more graduate students annually.</p>
<p>Nationally, only about 4 percent of Hispanics between the ages of 25 and 34 have associate's degrees or higher in STEM fields. Lu said this low number presents a serious challenge to meet the need for a world-leading STEM workforce. At UC Merced, 46 percent of undergraduate students are Hispanic underrepresented minorities, while 30 percent of UC Santa Cruz students fit the same category.</p>

(Photo by Melissa De Witte)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>When Katie Slocum, an anthropology major at UC Santa Cruz, got her first espresso fix at Verve, the specialty Santa Cruz coffee bar, she had no idea that a year later she would be following the company to a Honduran mountaintop on a journey through the coffee supply chain.</p>
<p class="normal">At the time, Slocum, who grew up in Sonora, knew she desperately wanted to work for the thriving local coffee company. Within a few months of tasting Verve&#8217;s special beans, she was a barista at the company&#8217;s bustling Capitola location.</p>
<p class="normal">Slocum&#8217;s passion for coffee developed an academic buzz beginning with the company&#8217;s new employee orientation. Colby Barr, co-owner and the company&#8217;s green buyer, called his new baristas to action: how can they help his company better connect coffee customers (&#8220;street level&#8221;) to growers (&#8220;farm level&#8221;)?</p>
<p class="normal">As Barr explained his commitment to bridging two opposite sides of the supply chain through buying directly from the source, &#8220;I knew I was getting into something bigger than myself,&#8221; Slocum remembered.</p>
<p class="normal"><strong>Fair trade vs. direct trade</strong></p>
<p class="normal">The more she learned about the cultural and economic disparities between fair trade versus direct trade and the disconnect between consumer and grower, the more questions she had.</p>
<p class="normal">While direct trade can provide extra money and resources to farm producers, what happens when relationships go bitter? Who ultimately carries the burden of environmental damage, drought, low cupping scores &#8211; all volatile factors in farm production? What options are available to farmers when Verve and other suppliers decide not to purchase?</p>
<p class="normal">And so Slocum&#8217;s senior thesis, <em>From Streetlevel to Farmlevel: An Ethnography of Direct Trade Coffee in Santa Barbara</em>, <em>Honduras</em> was born. Why not learn more about her employer through an ethnographic project?</p>
<p class="normal">Slocum proposed a bold idea: what if Verve were to sponsor her on a research trip to Honduras to study just how the company&#8217;s direct trade practice impacts producers, their families, and the people across the supply chain?</p>
<p class="normal">&#8220;Katie has what I like to call &#8216;the eye of the tiger,&#8217;&#8221; Barr said in an email interview. &#8220;When Katie pitched her concept, I was really impressed. It was the first time that we had one of our team put together such a thoughtful presentation on what she wanted to accomplish. She was even wearing her business suit!&#8221;</p>
<p class="normal"><strong>Central American journey</strong></p>
<p class="normal">And so, in spring of 2014, Slocum travelled with Barr to Honduras. From a long Guatemalan layover to trucking through backcountry roads of the Honduran countryside, then hiking when the roads ended, and finally trekking up mountain trails, Slocum was able to see the impact of Verve&#8217;s business approach.</p>
<p class="normal">Through buying direct, Verve is able to offer a better product to consumers and better prices for farmers. Slocum heard from one of Verve&#8217;s suppliers that the quality of specialty coffee has increased as a result of direct trade. When beans are sold to a fair-trade cooperative, they are blended with other farmers&#8217; crops, any unique flavor is lost. Offering distinct beans can earn farmers who sell directly to Verve up to three times more than its fair-trade partner.</p>
<p class="normal">Slocum also witnessed some troubling dilemmas of buying direct. As she saw crops decimated by <em>la roya</em>, a fungus infestation that is ravaging coffee plantations across Central America, she wondered what happens to a farm with unsellable beans? Without the guarantee that a fair-trade cooperative provides, what insurance policy do farmers have? How does Verve balance its commitment to the growers with its promise of quality product for consumers?</p>
<p class="normal">As she described in her thesis: &#8220;From the experience I&#8217;ve gained standing on those farms, shaking the hands of the producers that supply Verve, I&#8217;ve learned that humans have a moral imperative to support fellow humans, transcending nefarious backgrounds of colonial mercantilism and envisioning a future where the supply chain becomes more of a partnership, where people in both the Global North and the Global South can enjoy the benefits of a highly lucrative international enterprise.&#8221;</p>
<p class="normal"><strong>A transformation</strong></p>
<p class="normal">The trip transformed Slocum&#8217;s relationship to coffee, personally and professionally. As Barr observed, &#8220;I learned a lot from Katie's project. One thing was the reaffirmation of the power of origin to coffee professionals. It's one thing to love coffee, but once you visit the source it grabs hold of you in a way that is hard to explain and that never lets go. It's a powerful experience.&#8221;</p>
<p class="normal">Now that she has graduated, Slocum plans to continue improving the relationship between consumer to buyer. She <a href="https://streetleveltofarmlevel.wordpress.com/">published her project online</a>, with the hope that it can be a digital resource for coffee consumers, professionals, public, and academics alike.&#160;</p>
<p class="normal">Slocum&#8217;s thesis won the 2015 Social Sciences Dean&#8217;s Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Research.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://streetleveltofarmlevel.wordpress.com</url><title>Katie Slocum’s award-winning paper</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2cac7940807270173c4b67b165bae3e3"><name>grad-democracy-now</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Film grad lands fellowship at Democracy Now!</title><summary>Next week, 2015 graduate Juan Dávila Santiago will embark on a new chapter in his life--he’s off to New York where he landed a one-year News Production Fellowship to work at Democracy Now!.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, uc, ucsc film department, social documentaries, film news, democracy now</keywords><start-date>1435270200000</start-date><display-name>Film grad lands fellowship at Democracy Now!</display-name><path>/2015/06/grad-democracy-now</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/06/grad-democracy-now</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1435268577142</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1435348173059</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Academics</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/06/images/juan-lead-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/06/images/juan-lead-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>juan-lead-350.jpg</name><display-name>juan-lead-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>226366</file-size><width>350</width><height>525</height></image><image-alt>Juan C.

D&#225;vila Santiago</strong>&#8217;s thesis film was featured at the Del Mar Theater in Santa Cruz as part of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s annual screening of work from students graduating this year from the masters program in <a href="http://film.ucsc.edu/socdoc"><em><strong>Social Documentation</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p>Titled <em>The Stand-by Generation</em> (<em>La generaci&#243;n del estanbai</em>), his documentary examined the lives of a new generation of university graduates in Puerto Rico, caught in the world of part-time and temporary under-employment, struggling to survive.</p>
<p>Next week, D&#225;vila Santiago will embark on a new chapter in his own life&#8212;he&#8217;s off to New York where he landed a one-year News Production Fellowship to work at <a href="http://www.democracynow.org"><em><strong>Democracy Now!</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p>The daily, independent, award-winning news program--hosted by journalists Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzalez--currently airs on more than 1,300 public television and radio stations worldwide, including Pacifica, NPR, and PBS.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was applying to several jobs, but I was particularly interested in places that could serve in my development as a media producer,&#8221; said D&#225;vila Santiago. &#8220;The <em>Democracy Now!</em> fellowship is a mentored position that helps early career producers develop their skills in a news environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>I will be starting on July 6<sup>th</sup> at the Manhattan studio,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The position at <em>Democracy Now!</em> is a dream job for me. I admire what they&#8217;ve been doing and my duties assigned will be something that I will enjoy. What is better than working in something you like?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>D&#225;vila Santiago first began directing</strong> and producing low-budget short films while he was studying communications at the University of Sacred Heart in San Juan, Puerto Rico. His initial films were influenced by film noir and explored crime and corruption in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>To begin making documentary films, he founded a non-profit organization called <em>Frutos F&#237;lmicos</em> with the aim of not only producing films investigating social and environmental issues, but also of telling stories that mainstream media often ignores. His first feature-length documentary <em>Compa&#241;eros de lucha</em> screened internationally at various film festivals and received a distribution deal from Cinema Libre Studio.</p>
<p>In 2013, he came to UC Santa Cruz to pursue his master&#8217;s degree in Film and Digital Media, with an emphasis in Social Documentation. Santiago noted that his experience in the &#8220;Soc Doc&#8221; program was instrumental in helping him get the position at <em>Democracy Now!</em></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not your regular film program,&#8221; said D&#225;vila Santiago. &#8220;You engage with other disciplines, depending on your interests. You learn how to produce a documentary film, but also how to tell a story, how to do good research, and become a better writer. The program is very diverse. I think these skills learned were very important to get the fellowship at <em>Democracy Now!.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Once the fellowship is over, I wish to continue my career as a media maker,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I want to be able to live off this, while also keeping my ethics intact.

A new study by scientists at UC Santa Cruz, published June 26 in <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150626/ncomms8567/full/ncomms8567.html"><em>Nature Communications</em></a>, explains what drives this global process and how the flow is sustained.</p>
<p>About 25 percent of the heat that flows out of the Earth's interior is transferred to the oceans through this process, according to Andrew Fisher, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz and coauthor of the study. Much of the fluid flow and heat transfer occurs through thousands of extinct underwater volcanoes (called seamounts) and other locations where porous volcanic rock is exposed at the seafloor.</p>
<p>Fisher led an international team of scientists that in the early 2000s discovered the first field site where this process could be tracked from fluid inflow to outflow, in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. In a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6923/abs/nature01352.html">2003 paper published in <em>Nature</em>,</a> Fisher and others reported that bottom seawater entered into one seamount, traveled horizontally through the crust, gaining heat and reacting with crustal rocks, then discharged into the ocean through another seamount more than 50 kilometers away.</p>
<p>"Ever since we discovered a place where these processes occur, we have been trying to understand what drives the fluid flow, what it looks like, and what determines the flow direction," Fisher said.</p>
<p>For the new study, first author Dustin Winslow, a UCSC Ph.D. candidate who graduated this month, developed the first three-dimensional computer models showing how the process works. The models reveal a 'hydrothermal siphon' driven by heat loss from deep in the Earth and the flow of cold seawater down into the crust and of warmed water up out of the crust.</p>
<p>"Dustin's models provide the best, most realistic view of these systems to date, opening a window into a hidden realm of water, rock, and life," Fisher said.</p>
<p>The models show that water tends to enter the crust ('recharge') through seamounts where fluid flow is easiest due to favorable rock properties and larger seamount size. Water tends to discharge where fluid flow is more difficult due to less favorable rock properties or smaller seamount size. This finding is consistent with field observations suggesting that smaller seamounts are favored as sites of hydrothermal discharge.</p>
<p>"This modeling result was surprising initially, and we had to run many simulations to convince ourselves that it made sense," Winslow said. "We also found that models set up to flow in the opposite direction would spontaneously flip so that discharge occurred through less transmissive seamounts. This seems to be fundamental to explaining how these systems are sustained."</p>
<p>Winslow's project was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation through a graduate fellowship and as part of the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI). UCSC is a partner in C-DEBI, which is headquartered at the University of Southern California.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150626/ncomms8567/full/ncomms8567.html</url><title>Sustainability and dynamics of outcrop-to-outcrop hydrothermal circulation</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2004/06/520.html</url><title>UCSC scientist leads expedition to establish seafloor observatories</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2003/02/295.html</url><title>Volcanic seamounts siphon ocean water through the seafloor</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="30d663a6807270173c4b67b13d59c648"><name>rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-perry</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Profile / Kris Perry: Standing for equality </title><summary>Kris Perry (Merrill '86) doesn’t think about the way historians will tell her story.

<p>Instead, the 1986 Merrill College graduate with degrees in sociology and psychology thinks how life will be different for children nationwide because of what she did.</p>
<p>Perry was the named plaintiff in a lawsuit that challenged, and eventually overturned, Proposition 8, a 2008 California constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages. The decision opened the door for same-sex unions in the state.</p>
<p>Her effort also was part of the groundswell that led to a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court in June, legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. Her case, <em>Hollingsworth vs. Perry,</em> provided a foundation for other district court cases and for the marriage-rights movement in general. In addition, the public education she engaged in was part of the change in public opinion that led to more acceptance of gay marriage nationwide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sandy (Steir, Perry&#8217;s wife and co-plaintiff) and I are elated and relieved that we now live in a country where everyone can be married,&#8221; Perry said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve both experienced not only the joy of marriage these past two years but also the sense of permanence and protection marriage provides.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled for our family and for all the families across the country who can celebrate their love and connection today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Born in Bakersfield, Calif., Perry always felt like she was different. She just wasn&#8217;t sure why until she came to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;The middle of my freshman year, I started to figure it out,&#8221; Perry said. &#8220;I felt very supported as a person, and I found my voice, and how to be committed to a cause, and to put myself in situations where I made a difference. All the values that were emblematic of UC Santa Cruz were perfect for me at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2004, she married her longtime partner, Stier, at a ceremony at San Francisco City Hall. &#8220;A couple of months later, we got a letter from the City of San Francisco saying they had to rescind the marriage,&#8221; Perry remembered. &#8220;They&#8217;d attached the $35 check we&#8217;d paid for the marriage license. That really was a punch to the gut.&#8221;</p>
<p>Four years later, Prop. 8 passed and Perry was asked if she and Stier would be plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging the same-sex marriage ban. Perry was working for celebrity activist Rob Reiner on early childhood education at the time.</p>
<p>It was not a hard decision, said Perry, although she knew it would put her family, including the couple&#8217;s four children, under scrutiny. What was difficult, she said, was the pressure of having to represent an entire group of people with her story &#8220;in an authentic and useful way.&#8221;</p>
<p>On June 26, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to overturn a lower-court decision that declared the amendment unconstitutional, and Perry got a call from President Barack Obama telling her he was proud of what she had done.</p>
<p>Two days later, after the lower court unexpectedly lifted its stay of the ruling, Perry and Stier were married in a rushed ceremony at San Francisco City Hall.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was elated, overwhelmed, excited, happy, and a little bit in shock,&#8221; said Perry of her marriage. &#8220;I probably felt as happy as I have ever felt except for the day the boys (her twin sons) were born.&#8221; (The couple&#8217;s two other children are Stier&#8217;s from a previous marriage.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The part for me that thinks about history is how generations won&#8217;t be limited the way I was,&#8221; said Perry from her Washington, D.C.. office where she advocates for early childhood education. &#8220;I felt shame about who I was partially because of the laws (regarding same-sex marriage) that were in place. Those laws will be ancient history before kids today are old enough to fall in love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Perry is executive director of the First Five Years Fund, an advocacy group promoting early childhood education, and is happily settled with Stier in the nation&#8217;s capital.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not hard for Perry to summon the memory of the early days when she felt shame, when she was bombarded by the judgments of others because of who she was.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expended a huge amount of emotional energy just to feel OK or to be OK when other people were using their energy for totally different things like their careers and relationships,&#8221; Perry said. &#8220;I spent my life in a defensive posture.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://psychology.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/perry-recap.html</url><title>Alumna Kris Perry shares how she overturned Prop 8, the same-sex marriage ban</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/perry-talk.html</url><title>Campus role in overturning Proposition 8</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/02/karen-thompson-lecture.html</url><title>Winner of groundbreaking historic gay rights case spoke on campus: “Love is a Dangerous Promise”</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.supremecourt.gov/ObergefellHodges/AmicusBriefs/14-556_Family_Law_Scholars.pdf</url><title>Amicus Curiae brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in Obergefell v.

<p>Titled <em>All The Years Combine: Deadhead Treasures from the Grateful Dead Archive and GDTS Too</em>, the exhibition at the <a href="http://www.fieldmuseum.org"><strong><em>Field Museum</em></strong></a> features material from every part of the Grateful Dead&#8217;s career--documenting the extraordinary connection between the Grateful Dead and their family of fans.</p>
<p>&#8220;We contributed 93 pieces,&#8221; noted Nicholas Meriwether, the Grateful Dead Archivist at UC Santa Cruz, who also co-curated the exhibition. &#8220;The museum&#8217;s business director and the promoter of the Dead farewell tour wanted to do an exhibition that honored the band&#8217;s history and would help commemorate the final shows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meriwether will also be contributing an epic essay to the massive 80-disc, $700 collectors box set that will be released on September 18 to celebrate the band&#8217;s 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a book-length essay&#8212;approximately 80,000 words,&#8221; said Meriwether. &#8220;No one has actually ever written a tour-by-tour account of the band&#8217;s history. Since the box set focuses on unreleased live recordings, one from each year of their history, focusing on their performing career just seemed like the logical route to take.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that the Grateful Dead Archive at UC Santa Cruz has already been providing visual materials for all of the bands recent historical releases.</p>
<p>&#8220;One interesting challenge and great pleasure of my work for the past five years has been when the Dead&#8217;s legacy manager David Lemieux has asked for supporting materials for their releases. I get to look for correspondence, tickets, artwork&#8212;anything that helps to tell the story and give the historical context. But for this box set, I got to do this for 30 years of shows!&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Grateful Dead Archive</strong> has also shared items and artifacts with several other high profile venues in recent years, including the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/03/3582.html"><strong><em>New York Historical Society</em></strong></a> and the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/04/dead-hall-of-fame.html"><strong><em>Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame</em></strong></a>. This summer, it is also currently supporting a local exhibit on Jerry Garcia at the Museum of Art &amp; History in downtown Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The museum has reciprocated by lending their space to the campus to hold a fundraising dinner for the archive on Jerry Garcia&#8217;s 73<sup>rd</sup> birthday, August 1.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker will be Dennis McNally, the band&#8217;s longtime publicist and author of <em>A Long Strange Trip: The Inside History of the Grateful Dead</em>. &#8220;It&#8217;s the most exhaustive and authoritative account of the band&#8217;s history that has yet appeared,&#8221; noted Meriwether. <a href="http://specialevents.ucsc.edu/jerry-garcia/"><strong><em>Tickets</em></strong></a> for this special event are limited to just 73 guests.</p>
<p>Meriwether is also the curator of an <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/07/dead-book-exhibition.html"><em><strong>exhibition</strong></em></a> on the literary history of the Grateful Dead at the Archive&#8217;s home exhibition space, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/05/brittingham-dead-central.html"><strong><em>Dead Central</em></strong></a>, located at McHenry Library on the UC Santa Cruz campus. Titled <em>All the Pages Are Our Days: The Books of the Grateful Dead</em>, this exhibition runs through the end of the year and admission is free.</p>
<p>In addition to housing the Grateful Dead Archive, McHenry Library is also home to a number of other notable archives in its <a href="http://guides.library.ucsc.edu/speccoll/"><strong><em>Special Collections</em></strong></a> that hold particular historical and cultural significance to an international scholarly community. They include the archive of composer <strong>Lou Harrison</strong>, the personal mycology collection of <strong>John Cage</strong>, artwork by <strong>Lawrence Ferlinghetti</strong>, photography collections of <strong>Ansel Adams</strong> and <strong>Pirkle Jones</strong>, as well as the archives of the &#8220;dean&#8221; of American science fiction <strong>Robert Heinlein</strong>.</p>
<p>Meriwether reflected on the fact that both UC Santa Cruz and the Grateful Dead are this year now both commemorating their <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu"><strong><em>5</em></strong><strong><em>0<sup>th</sup> anniversary</em></strong></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful to be celebrating the band&#8217;s 50<sup>th</sup> at a campus that is also celebrating its 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary,&#8221; said Meriwether.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s given me a great opportunity to think of the surprising parallels between these remarkable cultural institutions&#8212;both of whom were pioneers in applying old fashioned standards of excellence and rigor in innovative, non-traditional, cutting-edge ways,&#8221; he added. <em><br/>

<p>Sure, it&#8217;s a bit sleepier than usual, and lots of the bustle has died down. But without the crowds, there is more room for contemplation and taking in the views. And <a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/parking/index.html">parking</a> will be a snap.</p>
<p>Just walking around is a wonderful way to begin exploring the campus. But if you want an even better sense of this lovely, hilly, 2,000-acre university, its groundbreaking research, and its unique programs, reserve your spot on a <a href="https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/see/tour_reservation_tool/visitor/welcome.cfm">90-minute walking tour</a>; the guided explorations run through the summer.</p>
<p><strong>McHenry and Science and Engineering libraries</strong></p>
<p>While the study carrels and quiet rooms may be free of nervous students studying for finals, McHenry and the Science &amp; Engineering libraries are both open to the public and pleasantly situated among towering redwoods.</p>
<p>The summer session hours, which run through August 28, are from Monday through Thursday 8 a.m.&#8211;8 p.m., on Friday from 8 a.m&#8211;5 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday, (McHenry only) from 12 p.m.&#8211;5 p.m. Stroll the stacks and take in the forest views. And remember that the campus&#8217;s one-of-a-kind Grateful Dead exhibit&#8212;the Brittingham Family Foundation&#8217;s Dead Central Gallery on the second floor of McHenry Library, featuring Dead memorabilia, writings, fan art, and much more&#8212;is open during regular library hours. The materials come from UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s world-famous <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/grateful-dead-archive">Grateful Dead Archive.</a></p>
<p><strong>Art galleries</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in artistic frame of mind, check out UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s intimate on-campus art galleries such as the <a href="http://art.ucsc.edu/galleries/sesnon/home">Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery</a> and <a href="http://art.ucsc.edu/galleries/sesnon/galleries">others</a>.</p>
<p>Work by renowned sculptor Coeleen Kiebert (M.S. psychology, &#8217;80) will be presented in a two-day exhibit at the <a href="http://cowell.ucsc.edu/smith-gallery/">Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery</a> on August 14 and 15 from 11 a.m.&#8211;7 p.m. both days. For the past four decades, Kiebert&#8217;s ceramic and bronze sculptures have been exhibited nationwide in museums and galleries.</p>
<p><strong>Fitness center</strong></p>
<p>It is hard to imagine a gym with a more stunning, sweep-around view then the one you get at the futuristic-looking, 6,500-square-foot <a href="http://opers.ucsc.edu/facilities/East%20Field%20House.html">OPERS Wellness Center,</a> which offers a fine selection of cardio and weight machines. Watch the Monterey Bay shimmer in the distance as you burn calories by the second. The OPERS complex is open Monday through Friday, 6:30 a.m.&#8211;7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m.&#8211;6 p.m. The facility is closed on July 4<sup>th</sup> weekend.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz OPERS Wellness program, which changed its name last year to UC Santa Cruz FitLife, is also available for non-students. By buying a facility usage membership card, or paying a day-use fee, community members have access to its&#160; recreation facilities, which include tennis, racquetball, and basketball courts; the wellness center; running track and playing fields; and a swimming pool. Enrollment is available online. Prices vary. For more information, call (831) 459-2531. Alumni Association members receive discounts on cards and day-use fees.</p>
<p><strong>On-campus dining</strong></p>
<p>Think the campus dining options dry up when the students take off? Think again. The convenient Global Village Caf&#233; at McHenry Library is open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m.&#8211;5 p.m., and Saturday through Sunday, noon&#8211;5 p.m. (the caf&#233; closes for the Independence Day holiday). Or if you are feeling insufficiently perky, you can always hit the PERK coffee bar at the Physical Sciences Building, open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m.&#8211;2 p.m., until September 1, and from September 8&#8211;18. It closes July 3 as well as from September 2&#8211;7. The coffee bar at University Center (located above Colleges Nine and Ten dining hall) is open through August 28, 8 a.m.&#8211;2 p.m. Monday through Friday. All these places are open to the general public.</p>
<p>Other standbys including Banana Joe&#8217;s, College Eight Caf&#233;, Cowell Coffee Shop, Crown/Merrill Dining Hall, Terra Fresca, and Oakes Caf&#233; all close for the summer. Take a look at the <a href="http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/dining/summer/index.html">online summer dining</a> schedule for more specifics about these eateries as well as three college-affiliated cafeterias on campus, which are also open to the public&#8212;and keep in mind that hours are subject to change.</p>
<p><strong>Market cart</strong></p>
<p>If all these cultural explorations make you a little bit peckish, drive on up (or jump on your cruiser bike) to the UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden&#8217;s market cart at the corner of Bay and High streets at the base of the UC Santa Cruz campus. The cart is open Tuesdays and Fridays from 12 noon&#8211;6 p.m., and features fresh, organic produce and flowers grown at the campus Farm &amp; Garden. For more information, call (831) 459-3240 or email <a href="mailto:casfs@ucsc.edu">casfs@ucsc.edu</a>. Read more about the <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu/community/produce-sales/index.html">Farm &amp; Garden&#8217;s produce sales options</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong>Arboretum</strong></p>
<p>Drive up Empire Grade between the two entrances to campus to find the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum and its unrivaled collection of flora from California as well as the southern hemisphere. Summer is always a good time to enjoy the ocean breezes and watch hummingbirds zip through the air or stroll among the famous Australian rock garden.</p>
<p>The Arboretum offers free admission on Community Day, which falls on the first Tuesday of every month. Visit the Arboretum&#8217;s <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu/">website</a> for <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu/visit/directions/">directions</a> or to <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu/visit/tours">schedule</a> a docent-led group tour. Regular admission is $5 for adults, $2 for children, and free for UC Santa Cruz students and members of Friends of the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. The Arboretum also offers a docent-led tour of its extensive gardens on the first Saturday of every month. Tours leave at 11 a.m. at <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu/shop">Norrie&#8217;s Gift and Garden Shop</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Seymour Marine Discovery Center</strong></p>
<p>If you venture away from the main campus area and down to the coast, you will find another UC Santa Cruz satellite where hard-working marine researchers are delving into the mysteries of the deep.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, it would be highly inadvisable to pet a shark (for instance, while you are surfing off the coast of Santa Cruz and see a 20-foot great white hanging around). But the swell sharks at the <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> are mellow, and amenable to petting.</p>
<p>Here in the center, volunteers will assist visitors and their young ones who wish to stroke one of these creatures. By the way, they&#8217;re called &#8220;swell sharks&#8221; not because they are excellent sharks&#8212;although they are&#8212;but for their tendency to gulp large amounts of water to make themselves swell up.</p>
<p>This museum&#8212;one of the best ways to become acquainted with the beautiful Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary without actually plunging into it&#8212;is also a great opportunity to see how marine scientists work. It is a special favorite of the little ones, who enjoy the behind-the-scenes tour where they can say hello to the dolphins. And of course, a visitor would not want to miss the colossal blue whale skeleton out front affectionately known as &#8220;Ms. Blue.&#8221;</p>
<p>The center is open from 10 a.m.&#8211;5 p.m., seven days a week in July and August, Tuesday through Sunday the rest of the year. Admission is $8 for adults, and $6 for students, seniors, and youth from 3 to 16. Children 2 and younger, members, and UC Santa Cruz undergraduates get in for free. For visitor information, call (831) 459-3800.</p>
<p><strong>Lick Observatory</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an extension of UC Santa Cruz that is even farther afield than the Seymour Center&#8212;and requires a trip &#8220;over the hill&#8221; to Silicon Valley, followed by a dramatic ascent of a peak&#8212;head out to the <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/public/visitors.html">Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton</a>, a state-of-the-art research facility for astronomers. The observatory is about 20 miles from downtown San Jose along Mt. Hamilton Road, which climbs to an elevation of 4,200 feet.</p>
<p>The Gift Shop &amp; Visitor Center is open Thursday through Sunday from 12 p.m.&#8211;5 p.m. year-round.</p>
<p>Lick Observatory is also home to the ever-popular <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/summer/">Music of the Spheres</a> series&#8212;but keep in mind that these events sell out very quickly.</p>
<p>For more information on the observatory, contact the Lick Observatory Guides Office/Gift Shop at (408) 274-5061 or <a href="mailto:giftshop@ucolick.org">giftshop@ucolick.org</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="466c136f807270173c4b67b163ac7b35"><name>apprenticeship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scholarships available for UC Santa Cruz organic farming apprenticeships</title><summary>Aspiring organic farmers and gardeners are invited to apply for the 2016 Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture at UC Santa Cruz.

Now in its 48th year, the Apprenticeship is the longest running university-based organic farming training program in the U.S.</p>
<p>The upcoming six-month program starts in April 2016. Scholarship support at different levels is available, including the Simply Organic annual scholarship. AmeriCorps funding can also be used to cover tuition costs.</p>
<p>The Apprenticeship is managed by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems at UC Santa Cruz. It is open to all participants 21 years or older, regardless of educational background.</p>
<p>Program information, application materials, details on scholarship support, and a list of dates for upcoming orientation tours are available online at <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu/apprenticeship">http://casfs.ucsc.edu/apprenticeship</a>. Application deadlines for the 2016 program are Aug. 15, 2015 for international applicants, and Sept. 30, 2015 for U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>The six-month, full-time residential program is based at the 30-acre organic farm and 3-acre Alan Chadwick Garden on the UC Santa Cruz campus. The program trains adults in the concepts and practices of organic gardening and small-scale sustainable farming. The Apprenticeship blends experiential learning with traditional classroom studies on topics that include soil management, composting, pest and weed control, crop planning, irrigation, farm equipment, direct marketing techniques, business planning, and social and environmental issues in the food system.</p>
<p>The 39 apprentices accepted into the program each year come from all regions of the U.S. and abroad, and represent a wide spectrum of ages, backgrounds, and interests.</p>
<p>Program graduates have established their own commercial farms and market gardens, developed farm- and garden-based educational programs, run urban garden programs, and more. You can read more about Apprenticeship alumni&#8217;s work at <a href="http://www.growafarmer.org">www.growafarmer.org</a></p>
<p>For examples of the Apprenticeship curriculum, see the newly revised and expanded <em>Teaching Organic Farming and Gardening: Resources for Instructors</em>, and <em>Teaching Direct Marketing and Small Farm Viability: Resources for Instructors</em>. New editions of both manuals were produced by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems in 2015, and are available free online at casfs.ucsc.edu/about/publications.</p>
