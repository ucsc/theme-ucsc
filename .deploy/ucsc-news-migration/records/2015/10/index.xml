<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines service animals as dogs individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability. The work or task that the dog performs is directly related to the individual's disability, and can include a wide variety of services, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>assisting those with low vision;</li>
<li>alerting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing;</li>
<li>pulling a wheelchair;</li>
<li>retrieving items such as medicine or a telephone;</li>
<li>recognizing and assist during seizures;</li>
<li>reminding handler to take medication;</li>
<li>detecting, preventing or interrupting the onset of a panic attack, or unwanted behaviors; and</li>
<li>assisting with balance or stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please be aware that some individuals using service animals do not have an obvious disability. Service dogs are not required to wear a vest or carry an identification card. To prevent misunderstandings and inappropriate inquiries, if you see a dog that you believe is not a service animal, <strong>please do not directly confront or question the person with the dog.</strong></p>
<p>The campus policy regarding service animals may be found <a href="http://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/BAS/BAS-001.html">online</a>.</p>
<p>Concerns about a service animal's behavior may be directed to the Associate Vice Chancellor of Risk and Safety Services, 831-459-3031. If an emergency related to safety, please call 911.</p>
<p>We appreciate your help in making UCSC a welcoming environment for people with disabilities and their service animals.</p>

<p>Carter's research focuses on energy-related technology including photovoltaics, solid-state lighting, and luminescent solar concentrators. With expertise in thin-film technologies and printable semiconductor materials, she has developed processes that can lower the manufacturing costs for solar cells. Carter has also been actively engaged in entrepreneurship, launching three start-up companies ranging from photovoltaic technologies to K-12 science education. She directs the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The citation from APS recognizes Carter "for contributions to the science required to improve production and utilization of energy, and efforts to exploit this understanding in both the world of commerce and in public policy."</p>
<p>Carter earned her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and worked at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories as a postdoctoral fellow and IBM Almaden Research Center as a visiting researcher before joining the UCSC faculty in 1995.</p>
<p>Election as an APS Fellow is a distinct honor signifying recognition by one's professional peers. Each year, elected fellows number no more than one-half of one percent of APS membership. APS represents over 50,000 members, including physicists in academia, national laboratories, and industry in the United States and throughout the world.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="255c694a8072701721067acf050d5285"><name>state-and-federal-notices</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Required State and Federal Notices</title><summary>The Annual Campus Security and Fire Safety Report 2014 is now online.</summary><start-date>1443682800000</start-date><display-name>Required State and Federal Notices</display-name><path>/2015/10/state-and-federal-notices</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/state-and-federal-notices</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1443735824626</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1444068995374</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>The University of California, Santa Cruz, is committed to assisting all members of the community in providing for their own safety and security.

<div><strong>Information about registered sex offenders</strong></div>
<div>Pursuant to the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, annually institutions of higher education must provide the campus community with how law enforcement agency information concerning registered sex offenders may be obtained. &#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The State of California requires sex offenders to register with the police department in the jurisdiction in which they reside. The state makes this information available to law enforcement agencies. This information is available to the public at the local police/sheriff&#8217;s department. For the UC Santa Cruz campus, information on registered sex offenders is available at the Santa Cruz County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, 701 Ocean St., Santa Cruz, CA 95060, <a href="tel:831-454-2242" target="_blank" value="+18314542242">831-454-2242</a>.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Additionally, the Federal Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act provides for the tracking of convicted sex offenders enrolled at or employed at institutions of higher education.</div>
<div></div>
<div>California Penal Code &#167;290.01 requires sex offenders who are enrolled as a student, or is, with or without compensation, a full-time or part-time employee, or is carrying on a vocation for more than 14 days, or for an aggregate period exceeding 30 days in a calendar year to register with the UC Santa Cruz Police Department within five working days of commencing enrollment or employment.

<div></div>
<div><strong>California Mandatory Reporting Laws</strong></div>
<div>As outlined by Penal Code &#167;368 and Welfare and Institutions Code &#167;15600 et al., the California Legislature enacted recent laws to require elderly and dependent adult care custodians, health practitioners, Adult Protective Services staff, law enforcement, and other designated agencies to report and to investigate incidents of abuse/neglect. The categories of abuse and neglect that must be reported by mandated parties now include: physical, sexual, financial, isolation, abandonment, abduction, neglect, mental suffering, and self-neglect.</div>
<div></div>
<div>California Penal Code &#167;11160 requires prompt, mandatory reporting to the local law enforcement agency by healthcare practitioners (such as those at the Cowell Student Health Center) when they provide medical services to a person they know or reasonably suspect is suffering from wounds inflicted by a firearm or as a result of assaultive or abusive conduct.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Child Abuse Neglect and Reporting Act (CANRA), codified in California Penal Code &#167;&#167;11164-11174.3, requires that employers of mandated reporters (as defined in the Act) promote identification and reporting of child abuse or neglect. It is the policy of the University of California to comply with its obligations under the Act; to require that all university employees and administrators who are mandated reporters make required reports to child protection or law enforcement agencies; and, more broadly, to encourage all members of the university community who observe, have actual knowledge of, or reasonably suspect child abuse or neglect at a university facility or perpetrated by university personnel to promptly report the concern to appropriate law enforcement, external officials and university officials.&#160; More information about the University of California CANRA Policy can be found at: <a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000603/CANRA" target="_blank">policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000603/CANRA</a>. &#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Student Safety Bill (AB 1433)</strong></div>
<div>Pursuant to California Education Code &#167;&#167; 67380(a)(6)(A), 67381 and 67383(a), the UC Santa Cruz Police Department must report immediately or as soon as practicably possible to the appropriate local law enforcement agency, all reports received by a campus security authority (CSA) of any Part 1 violent crime, sexual assault, or hate crime, committed on or off campus. This includes reports victims make directly to CSAs as well as reports victims make to other University employees that are then conveyed to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department or other CSAs. &#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Such reports will include, when the victim has consented to being identified:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The name and characteristics of the victim;</li>
<li>The name and characteristics of the perpetrator if known;</li>
<li>Description of the incident, including location and date and time; and</li>
<li>Any report number assigned to the police incident report documenting the investigation being conducted by the jurisdictional agency.</li>

<p>The campus was able to meet Santa Cruz city mandatory water usage restrictions because of nearly 10 years of previous planning and collaboration with city water officials. From June 2014 to January 2015, the campus saved 27.81 million gallons of water and approximately $280,000 in water utility bills.</p>
<p>"This project highlights the effectiveness of collaborative relationships in meeting seemingly impossible goals," said Campus Energy Manager Patrick Testoni. The savings resulted from water efficiency projects, web-based water management, and extensive campus engagement, he said.</p>
<p>The award came in the 2015 Energy Efficiency and Sustainability Best Practice competition in the category of Water Efficiency and Site Water Quality.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2007, the campus developed a strategic water master plan that then served as the basis for water conservation efforts when the drought became apparent four years ago. Representatives from units across campus meet monthly to review water usage. UCSC first tested a web-based water management system that allows individual campus users to view their water usage on an hourly basis. Then, based on its success, the campus has installed the cellular-based transmitters on all campus water meters.</p>
<p>A water conservation student intern team helped communicate the conservation message to students and staff and helped identify and report leaks.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/06/water-meters.html</url><title>Campus deploying cellular water meters to aid in conservation</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="256eac018072701721067acf3d56a1a4"><name>crotty-art-stargazing</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Internationally acclaimed artist to lead evening of stargazing at UC Santa Cruz   </title><summary>Acclaimed artist Russell Crotty and the grad student-led Astronomy Club will present an evening of stargazing on the hillside above UC Santa Cruz’s Great Meadow on October 14.</summary><keywords>UC Santa Cruz, UCSC, Institute of the Arts and Sciences, Russell Crotty, UC Santa Cruz news</keywords><start-date>1443739200000</start-date><display-name> Artist Russell Crotty to lead evening of stargazing at UC Santa Cruz   </display-name><path>/2015/10/crotty-art-stargazing</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/crotty-art-stargazing</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1443737021391</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1444174313753</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/RCrotty_M15inPegasus-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/RCrotty_M15inPegasus-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>RCrotty_M15inPegasus-375.jpg</name><display-name>RCrotty_M15inPegasus-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>79378</file-size><width>375</width><height>433</height></image><image-alt>Russell Crotty, M15 Globular Cluster in Pegasus, 2001, Ink on paper on fiberglass sphere 4</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/RCrotty-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/RCrotty-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>RCrotty-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>RCrotty-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19784</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Russell Crotty, M15 Globular Cluster in Pegasus, 2001, Ink on paper on fiberglass sphere 4</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Russell Crotty,&#160;<em>M15 Globular Cluster in Pegasus, 2001</em>, Ink on paper on fiberglass sphere 45 inch diameter, Collection of MOCA Miami.</p>

(Photo by John Weber)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Acclaimed artist <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/07/warhol-ias-grant.html"><em><strong>Russell Crotty</strong></em></a> and the grad student-led Astronomy Club will present an evening of stargazing on the hillside above UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Great Meadow on October 14.</p>
<p>Observers will have the opportunity to examine the night sky through a battery of the club&#8217;s telescopes trained on the stars and planets, as well as look at the cosmos through the eyes of the 2015 Guggenheim Award-winning artist.</p>
<p>Crotty is known internationally for his drawings and sculpture based on direct astronomical observation--investigating the cosmos and exploring the nature of the universe through art. His astronomical drawings, sculpture, and large-scale artist-made books are in major collections throughout the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>He is currently <a href="http://ias.ucsc.edu/content/2015/artist-residence-russell-crotty"><em><strong>artist-in-residence</strong></em></a> at the Institute of the Arts and Sciences, collaborating with the UC Lick Observatory and&#160;Theoretical Astrophysics Santa Cruz to create a new body of work, which will be exhibited at the San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA)&#160;beginning in Fall 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suspect that this will be quite different from any star party I&#8217;ve been to,&#8221; Crotty noted. &#8220;It will be different because there will be a lot of really smart grad students from astrophysics that bring out the telescopes and will probably rattle off a lot of really interesting information about everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, I&#8217;m a visual observer,&#8221; he added. &#8220;When I sweep the cosmos with my own telescopes, I&#8217;m always looking for something indescribably beautiful: an ancient star cluster in our own galaxy, or a globular star cluster, or the subtlety of a planetary image. So for me, it&#8217;s kind of a very special visual experience. It&#8217;s very hard to convey as a visual artist, but I&#8217;ve made attempts for 20 years to do that. It&#8217;s always a challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The evening will begin</strong> with a brief talk by Crotty about his art practice and his experience at Lick, and with the Theoretical Astrophysics Santa Cruz (TASC) working group on campus. Everyone will then move onto the hillside above the Great Meadow, where the graduate students will bring out the UC Santa Cruz telescopes. Warm beverages will be provided by the Institute of the Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people look at the stars and have no idea that if you magnify an area of the sky, you&#8217;re going to see some amazing things,&#8221; said Crotty. &#8220;If you&#8217;re not an observer and haven&#8217;t really looked at telescopes, it&#8217;s a breathtaking experience. At this time of year, we have a lot of beautiful things--in fact, October is one of the best months to observe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crotty described what people might expect at the event, which takes place in the dark of a new moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think people will see things like planetary nebulae: very subtle stars that have died, they&#8217;ve expanded and lost their shell of gas, illuminating a shape that is very ghostly,&#8221; said Crotty. &#8220;If they have any interest at all and want to see something bigger than themselves and the controlled world we live in, this is a great way to use your imagination and look at these things that way."</p>
<p>"Meanwhile, I think the grad students will fill people in--on the distance to a certain object, what the components are of the object, how the object happened, how old is the object--all of these things.&#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m eternally enthusiastic about this stuff,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It&#8217;s just so exciting to be able to do this, and have super smart kids working with the scopes, because I want to hear what they have to say too!&#160; And I can wax lyrical as an artist about&#160; the subtlety, and the beauty, and the colors&#8230;&#8221;</p>

Her research has taken her to 18 gardens across central California.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>From Watsonville &#160;to Salinas, San Jose, and Santa Cruz, Philpott discovered that each urban garden is different with cultural and economic factors influencing its biodiversity.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This is reflected in the Beach Flats Community Garden near the Boardwalk in Santa Cruz. Only half an acre, it is the only green space in the area, a lush oasis tucked behind urban grit.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It is in an area with a troubled past, known for a higher than average crime rate, dense urbanization and poverty. But for more than 20 years, the garden has helped build community in the area and is now under threat of being closed next month.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;It seems more than other gardens to be a community space. We often see folks shelling beans together, or playing games, or just having weekend conversations &#8211; more so than many of the other community gardens where we are working,&#8221; Philpott said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Research findings discussed</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Philpott, holder of the Ruth and Alfred Heller Chair in Agroecology and the interim director of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), will discuss her research in the Beach Flats Community Garden and other urban gardens when the Division of Social Sciences holds its annual Research Frontiers Evening Nov. 5, 2015 at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History.</span> <a href="http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/research/research-frontiers/index.html"><span>Learn more</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;It is a refuge here,&#8221; said undergraduate student researcher Montse Plascencia (Stevenson, &#8216;15, environmental studies and ecology &amp; evolutionary biology).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But the residents also share the garden with something else. "It is a safe spot for people and also bugs,&#8221; Plascencia said</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Like many of the urban gardens Philpott and her team study, the Beach Flats Community Garden plays a significant role in the diversification of both insects and a community. It provides an ecosystem for at least 12 species of bees, nine species of ladybugs, seven species of ground spiders, and four superfamilies of parasitoids.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Just this week when we sampled there I found six species of ladybugs,&#8221; said Monica Egerer, a Ph.D. student and researcher on the project. &#8220;In other gardens, however, I find on average just one or two species of ladybugs in a sampling. For many this may be counterintuitive, but I think it reflects that the garden is obviously an urban oasis for biodiversity,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;It is really important for maintaining biodiversity and movement of organisms from one location to another,&#8221; &#160;Philpott said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Effects of culture on ecolog</strong>y</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Philpott and her team also notice cultural factors that contribute to a garden&#8217;s ecological diversity and environment. &#160;What people grow impacts the types of bugs, birds, and bees in a garden&#8217;s habitat. And what people are likely to grow depends on their cultural background and ethnic heritage.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For example, 46 percent of the Beach Flats residents are Latino (compared with the citywide average of 17 percent.) The garden features food reflective of a Latino cuisine&#8211;beans, squash, and corn as well as popular condiments like cilantro and cactus. Some of the team&#8217;s data show that the crops and varieties grown in Beach Flats differ significantly from those in other nearby gardens.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In comparison, another urban garden Philpott studies is in an Iranian-populated neighborhood of San Jose where common cultural foods like cucumbers and mint are grown. These cultural and ethnic differences in what people decide to plant likely enhances overall biodiversity in the region, as different crop species likely attract different types of bugs and birds, Philpott said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There are many other variables that contribute to a green spaces&#8217; diversity as well. Philpott considers factors such as as how wooded an area is, what the shrubbery is like, whether the beds are mulched to study what impacts ecological and environmental habitat.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Community learning and research</strong> &#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I get inspired by these gardens.&#8221; Plascencia said about the role in science education these spaces provide. When Plascencia graduates, she hopes to find an active educational role in urban gardens in Los Angeles where she is from.</span></p>

The new findings, published October 5 in <em>Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology</em>, reveal how the enzyme carries out a crucial function involved in protecting the ends of chromosomes.</p>
<p>Repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, called telomeres, serve as protective caps (often compared to the plastic tips on shoelaces). As cells divide, their telomeres get progressively shorter, until eventually the cells stop dividing. The telomerase enzyme lengthens telomeres by adding more of the repetitive DNA sequence. It is active in cells that need to keep dividing indefinitely, such as stem cells, and in about 90 percent of malignant tumors.</p>
<p>"Since the discovery of telomerase and its over-activation in cancers, people have recognized the huge therapeutic potential for anticancer drugs that target telomerase. But there still is no such drug in the clinic, and part of the reason is our lack of understanding of the detailed structure of the enzyme," said Michael Stone, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz and senior author of the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Unusual enzyme</strong></p>
<p>Telomerase is an unusual enzyme in that it is composed of a protein component and an RNA component. The protein is a type of enzyme called a reverse transcriptase, which makes DNA copies of RNA sequences. The RNA component provides the template that the enzyme copies to generate the telomere DNA sequence.</p>
<p>"The template is the track that the enzyme train runs along, and what's so unique with telomerase is that the track is an integral component of the enzyme itself," Stone said.</p>
<p>The enzyme copies the same short segment of RNA template over and over again to generate the repetitive DNA of the telomere. One of the mysteries has been how the copied sequence is so precisely defined, since it is a relatively small segment of the much larger telomerase RNA. Stone's group solved the structure of a region called the RNA binding domain, and their findings explain how the boundary of the template is defined by the interplay between the protein and RNA components of the telomerase.</p>
<p>Essentially, the binding domain tethers one end of the RNA so that only a defined sequence can move through the active site of the enzyme where copying takes place. As the enzyme copies the template sequence, it pulls the RNA through the active site until there is no more slack left, at which point a molecular "tug of war" between the binding domain and the reverse transcriptase stops the movement of RNA into the active site.</p>
<p>"The reverse transcriptase is pulling on the RNA, but the structural resistance of the RNA binding domain prohibits the movement of more RNA, and that's how the template boundary is defined," Stone said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Reset</strong></p>
<p>The enzyme then resets to the beginning of the template sequence and starts over. Stone's group showed that the section of RNA that is tethered to the protein forms a structure known as an RNA stem loop, and a protein structure in the binding domain is wedged into the base of the RNA stem, anchoring it in place.</p>
<p>"Our model is consistent with the findings of other studies of telomerase and directly reveals the functional mechanism involved," Stone said. "What makes this interesting for rational drug design is that template boundary definition is a very specific feature of telomerase. Our cells are full of other kinds of polymerase enzymes, so it's important to design a drug that targets only telomerase."</p>
<p>Linnea Jansson, a graduate student in molecular, cell and developmental (MCD) biology at UC Santa Cruz, is first author of the paper, which Stone said is the culmination of more than six years of work by numerous researchers in his lab. The researchers performed x-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the RNA binding domain, using the <a href="http://strucbiol.pbsci.ucsc.edu/">Macromolecular Structure Function Core Facility</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In addition to Jansson and Stone, the coauthors include Ben Akiyama, now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado School of Medicine; Alexandra Ooms, who worked in Stone's lab as an undergraduate and is now at Stanford University; postdoctoral researcher Cheng Lu; and Seth Rubin, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry.</p>

In a paper published October 5 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, researchers describe a novel method to perform diagnostic assays for multiple strains of flu virus on a small, dedicated chip.</p>
<p>"A standard flu test checks for about ten different flu strains, so it's important to have an assay that can look at ten to 15 things at once. We showed a completely new way to do that on an optofluidic chip," said senior author Holger Schmidt, the Kapany Professor of Optoelectronics in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Schmidt and his collaborators at BYU have developed chip-based technology to optically detect single molecules without the need for high-end laboratory equipment. Diagnostic instruments based on their optofluidic chips could provide a rapid, low-cost, and portable option for identifying specific disease-related molecules or virus particles.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplexing</strong></p>
<p>In the new study, Schmidt demonstrated a novel application of a principle called wavelength division multiplexing, which is widely used in fiber-optic communications. By superimposing multiple wavelengths of light in an optical waveguide on a chip, he was able to create wavelength-dependent spot patterns in an intersecting fluidic channel. Virus particles labeled with fluorescent markers give distinctive signals as they pass through the fluidic channel depending on which wavelength of light the markers absorb.</p>
<p>"Each color of light produces a different spot pattern in the channel, so if the virus particle is labeled to respond to blue light, for example, it will light up nine times as it goes through the channel, if it's labeled for red it lights up seven times, and so on," Schmidt explained.</p>
<p>The researchers tested the device using three different influenza subtypes labeled with different fluorescent markers. Initially, each strain of the virus was labeled with a single dye color, and three wavelengths of light were used to detect them in a mixed sample. In a second test, one strain was labeled with a combination of the colors used to label the other two strains. Again, the detector could distinguish among the viruses based on the distinctive signals from each combination of markers. This combinatorial approach is important because it increases the number of different targets that can be detected with a given number of wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>For these tests, each viral subtype was separately labeled with fluorescent dye. For an actual diagnostic assay, fluorescently labeled antibodies could be used to selectively attach distinctive fluorescent markers to different strains of the flu virus.</p>
<p><strong>On-chip bioanalysis</strong></p>
<p>While previous studies have shown the sensitivity of Schmidt's optofluidic chips for detection of single molecules or particles, the demonstration of multiplexing adds another important feature for on-chip bioanalysis. Compact instruments based on the chip could provide a versatile tool for diagnostic assays targeting a variety of biological particles and molecular markers.</p>
<p>The optofluidic chip was fabricated by Schmidt's collaborators at Brigham Young University led by Aaron Hawkins. The joint first authors of the <em>PNAS</em> paper are Damla Ozcelik and Joshua Parks, both graduate students in Schmidt's lab at UC Santa Cruz. Other coauthors include Hong Cai and Joseph Parks at UC Santa Cruz and Thomas Wall and Matthew Stott at BYU.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/ebola-detection.html">another recent paper</a>, published September 25 in <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14494"><em>Nature Scientific Reports</em></a>, Schmidt's team reported the development of a hybrid device that integrates an optofluidic chip for virus detection with a microfluidic chip for sample preparation.</p>
<p>"These two papers represent important milestones for us. Our goal has always been to use this technology to analyze clinically relevant samples, and now we are doing it," Schmidt said.</p>

At the outset, everyone agreed that the Carbon Neutrality Initiative would require all hands on deck from staff, faculty and students alike to make its ambitious goal a reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re on our way to becoming the very first university system to wipe out our carbon footprint for good,&#8221; said UC President Janet Napolitano. &#8220;It&#8217;s a daring goal, and one that will take both individual and collective action to make happen. Part of that is building awareness about easy steps each of us can take to reduce our carbon footprint.&#8221;</p>
<p>Launching Oct. 6 and running through Dec. 10, the first <a href="http://www.coolcampuschallenge.org">Cool Campus Challenge</a> aims to get everyone across the UC campuses on board with the carbon neutrality effort with a bit of friendly competition to get things moving.</p>
<p>During the 10-week contest, UC faculty, staff and students will be challenged to take steps to reduce their carbon footprints using an online tool to track their activity and earn points for their campus. The reward? Bragging rights for the winning campus and progress toward carbon neutrality for the university as a whole.</p>
<p>"Reaching carbon neutrality at UC within the next 10 years will definitely be a team effort comprised of a wide variety of ideas for innovative implementation, research and technological solutions," said Elida Erickson,&#160;sustainability programs manager and interim director&#160;for the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu">Sustainability Office</a>. "The Cool Campus Challenge provides a fun avenue for all UCSC Slugs, whether faculty, staff or students, to join that team effort!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Who&#8217;s the coolest?</strong></p>
<p>Modeled on the Cool California Cities Challenge, which gives Californians the tools they need to take action to protect the climate and keep California cool, the Cool Campus Challenge focuses on actions that individuals can take to put their campus on track to reach carbon neutrality.</p>
<p>Each week, the Cool Campus Challenge will highlight an important sustainability theme, from food waste to lighting to transportation. To earn points for their campuses, participants will make pledges and take actions to directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions or increase awareness about climate disruption, and record their actions on the Cool Campus Challenge website to earn points for their school. Proud participants are encouraged to show off their efforts on social media (and egg on their competition) with the hashtag #UCool. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>Cool in action</strong></p>
<p>In many cases, the activities in the challenge will be simple things that a lot of us already do: turning off lights when you leave a room, taking public transportation, composting food waste. Others may require extra thought or effort: replacing incandescent lightbulbs with LEDs or eliminating single-use items from your life.</p>
<p>Participants can also earn bonus points for completing actions within a time limit or for taking new and creative actions beyond those suggested in the challenge.</p>
<p>While the challenge will be more fun and perhaps even more productive in teams, it also can be a great showcase for the power of individuals to make a difference.</p>
<p>At the end of the contest, the campus with the highest point count will be crowned the &#8220;Coolest UC Campus.&#8221; There also will be rewards and recognition for the campuses that are leading throughout the competition.</p>

<h3>Lawrence Weschler</h3>
<p>nonfiction author, former <em>New Yorker</em> staff member</p>
<p>Asked to recall a hinge moment, Lawrence (Ren) Weschler (Cowell '74, philosophy, Western civilization), a much-praised author of narrative nonfiction and former <em>New Yorker</em> staff member, offered up two classics.</p>
<p>"My first week at Cowell College, in a seminar for the Western Civ core course with 12 of us students being led by Harry Berger, I was mouthing off about how stupid Plato's <em>Republic</em> was. 'No&#160;wonder Socrates wins all these arguments,' I declared. 'The people he is arguing with are a bunch of doofuses!' Harry looked over at me and said, 'The thing of it is, Ren, that Plato is a genius and you are a freshman, and he is playing you like a piano. Maybe you should try to make out to the music. Does it occur to you that as far as Plato was concerned, the tragedy of Socrates's life was that he never found someone to talk to&#8212;a worthy interlocutor&#8212;in his lifetime? And that the dialogues were sent out into the future in search of someone for him to have a conversation&#160;with.'</p>
<p>That was a pretty good lesson to hear one's first week in college&#8212;for starters that you should not assume that you necessarily know more than these masters, but more to the point, that you should always read actively, both read and monitor how you are reading and how you are being read. Which proved a good life lesson, whether engaging texts, or, later on, any sort of reportorial situation."</p>
<p>Along the same lines, Weschler relates how once, when studying with Marine Biology Professor Todd Newberry, he presented himself during office hours, floundering over some over-broad essay assignment.</p>
<p>"Newberry advised, 'Were you to be walking on a beach and come upon a dead walrus and wonder why it had died, you could do one of two things. You could pick up a piece of driftwood and start bashing its flanks, and all you would do is make a complete hash of things. Or you could take that same stick, go over to a boulder, pick up a stone and spend several hours sharpening the stick, at the end of which you would have a blade&#8212;thanks to which within minutes all would become clear.'</p>
<p>He paused and continued: 'When you are dealing with huge, amorphous issues, don't ask huge, amorphous questions. Spend 95 percent of your time honing the questions, after which the topic will open itself up to you.' Another lesson I regularly take to heart to this day."</p>

<h3>Hector Tobar</h3>
<p>Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning journalist and author</p>
<p>For Hector Tobar (Oakes '85, Latin American studies/sociology), now a Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning journalist and author, there were many decisive moments&#8212;and they started happening from the minute he set foot on campus as a 17-year-old in 1980.</p>
<p>"I'd grown up in a very flat, very dry series of Los Angeles neighborhoods&#8212;from the inner-city to the suburbs," he said. "I was awed by the landscape of the campus, with its soaring redwoods and expansive vistas. More than that, UC Santa Cruz was a cauldron of causes, of idealism and activism. I was a pre-med major, but quickly switched to the study of Latin American history, and to the theories of injustice and social change. Writing became my passion, in part because I was often in small classrooms where my professors worked hard at critiquing and editing my papers.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz made me a thinker and a writer. I spent many long hours in my apartment at Oakes College, and those of my friends, discussing and debating ideas and how the world worked and how we might make it better. I wrote for the 'minority'-run quarterly paper <em>TWANAS</em> (as in <em>Third World and Native American Student Press Collective</em>)&#8212;and I wrote, for the first time in my life, very long essays and papers.</p>
<p>Back then, you might write a 40-page final paper for a class. I hacked these out on my typewriter, and then in the computer lab where something called 'word processing' was being introduced to us, on computers that were so big we weren't even in the same room with them. And then when we were done we'd drive or bike into town to celebrate, and then ride back, up to the meadows and the forests."</p>

<h3>Martha Mendoza</h3>
<p>Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning AP reporter and author</p>
<p>Martha Mendoza (Kresge '88, journalism and education), Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning Associated Press reporter and author, had an awakening with personal, political, and professional implications.</p>
<p>"My pivot moment came when I landed in Conn Hallinan's journalism class," she said. "He was lively and engaging, and as angry as I was about the wrongs of the world. For the first time I saw work I could do that had real meaning.</p>
<p>I had just spent a summer visiting Central America and was really perplexed by the role the U.S. was playing in several small Central American countries. Our military was getting involved in civil wars and domestic issues, going well beyond humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>To see what war looked like, in person, as a 19-year-old was outrageous. The refugee camps, bombed homes, towns made uninhabitable because of land mines were fundamentally disturbing. I was aggravated that there was very little public awareness about this.</p>
<p>Conn told me 30 years ago I had 'enormous potential as a professional journalist.'</p>
<p>No one had ever said anything like that to me. I believed him, and still work to live up to his belief in me."</p>

<h3>Reyna Grande</h3>
<p>award-winning author</p>
<p>Reyna Grande's hinge moment happened during one of those longstanding UC Santa Cruz traditions: a protest.</p>
<p>The future award-winning author (Kresge '99, creative writing, film and video) attended UC Santa Cruz on the advice of her junior college English teacher, who thought it would be good for her to get out of Los Angeles and see something new.</p>
<p>"At UC Santa Cruz, it was my first time being immersed in nature. The redwood forest offered peace and tranquility to my troubled spirit. I had left a home where I had been physically and emotionally abused by my father. In my dorm at Kresge College, I was free from the abuse. I finally felt liberated, and the beautiful surroundings helped me heal from my psychological traumas. It was there where I began to flourish.</p>
<p>When I chose to live at Kresge, I didn't know that most Latino students (there weren't many of us back then) were at Oakes College! Coming from L.A. where the Latino population is 50 percent, it was a shock to me to find myself as the minority. Often in my literature and creative writing classes at Kresge, I was the only Latina student. One day, as I was heading to class, one of my roommates&#8212;a Caucasian girl&#8212;asked me why I wasn't down at Hahn Hall with my people, protesting with them. I didn't know what she was talking about and I insisted that I needed to get to class. But she took me by the arm and dragged me to Hahn Hall because she said I needed to support my people in their protest.</p>
<p>When I arrived, I was in for a shock. There they were, the Latino students. Several hundred of them linking hands, chanting 'S&#237; Se Puede!' ['Yes, We Can!'] and 'El Pueblo Unido Jam&#225;s Ser&#225; Vencido' ['The People United Will Never Be Defeated']. They were protesting Proposition 209, which abolished California's affirmative action program, a program that had benefited me.</p>
<p>That day I suddenly didn't feel alone anymore at seeing all those Latino students. And as I joined hands with them I silently thanked my roommate for bringing me there. I found it incredible that a non-Latina had held me accountable and made me support my people! That first protest showed me that we all have a voice, and that together, we need to speak up for the injustices that we see in the world.</p>
<p>I felt different after that day. I had more confidence in myself. I was more determined than ever to get a college education and really make a difference in my family, my Latino community, and my country."</p>

<h3>Matt Skenazy</h3>
<p>assistant editor, <em>Outside</em> magazine</p>
<p>Matt Skenazy (Cowell '08, literature), assistant editor at <em>Outside</em> magazine, wasn't interested in writing before coming to UC Santa Cruz. But when he arrived on campus, he found out that Conn Hallinan, who so greatly influenced alumna Martha Mendoza, was about to teach his last class on campus. Also, Hallinan was a family friend (Skenazy's father is Paul Skenazy, a UC Santa Cruz professor emeritus of literature).</p>
<p>"For those reasons alone, I figured I should take it," Skenazy said. "The class changed everything."</p>
<p>By the time he left to travel in New Zealand and Indonesia after graduating, UC Santa Cruz had provided a focus and framework for those journeys. "On those trips, I didn't bring a camera. If I wanted to remember anything, I had to write it down."</p>
<p>Looking back, he is grateful for Hallinan and another alumna and faculty member, lecturer and student media adviser Susan Watrous (Kresge '87, American studies), for encouraging him to write.</p>
<p>"When I was away, I'd send them stories. Nine months later, I came back to join the soccer team for preseason in Brazil. I wrote a feature story for the school paper about the trip, which was the first piece I ever had published. I guess what I'm getting at is that though UC Santa Cruz no longer had a formal journalism program [the program ended in 2003], there were ways to develop as a nonfiction writer anyway; that is why we have such a long and wonderful list of alumni writers&#8212;Martha Mendoza, <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer Bill Finnegan, Lawrence Weschler, etc.</p>
<p>Later, I wrote a story for <em>City on a Hill</em> about noted author and magazine writer Dan Duane (Ph.D. '96, literature), also a UC Santa Cruz alum. He had a job I thought sounded great&#8212;traveling around and writing about adventures for <em>Outside, The Surfer's Journal,</em> and <em>National Geographic Adventure.</em> When I went to interview him, he was doing something in another room, but told me to look out the window and write down what I saw so I would have a scene to set the article in.</p>
Of course, I started the story with him telling me to look out the window. So those trips, my experiences at UC Santa Cruz, and Dan taught me to look out windows, so to speak."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3f49ab0e8072701721067acf4fa7710b"><name>living-writers-series</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Fall 2015 Living Writers Series kicks off October 8 </title><summary>Each quarter, the Humanities Division’s Living Writers Series brings visiting authors and poets into UC Santa Cruz classes to give students an in-depth look into the world of the working writer.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, living writers series, al young, uc santa cruz events, uc santa cruz news, ucsc news</keywords><start-date>1444173300000</start-date><display-name> Fall 2015 Living Writers Series kicks off October 8 </display-name><path>/2015/10/living-writers-series</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/living-writers-series</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1444170803954</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1444778160952</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/tonya-foster-3501.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/tonya-foster-3501.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tonya-foster-3501.jpg</name><display-name>tonya-foster-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>157047</file-size><width>350</width><height>351</height></image><image-alt>Tonya M.

Alison will be returning to her research and teaching in anthropology.<br/>
<br/>
 I am thankful for Alison's service and leadership over the last five years, especially during some very challenging budget years. She has been responsible for the day-to-day academic and administrative operations of the campus, including budget oversight and long-term planning.<br/>
<br/>
 Alison's commitment to student success is highlighted by her initiatives to increase retention rates for undergraduate students, enhance academic pathways to allow students to graduate in four years or less, and secure recognition as a Hispanic Serving Institution.<br/>
<br/>
 Alison and I have worked together on many important campus projects. I have enjoyed our collaboration and teamwork over the years. UC Santa Cruz has been well-served by her deep roots on campus and in the community, as well as by her passion for the university and its students, faculty, and staff.<br/>
<br/>
 Alison joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1990. She had served as chair of the Anthropology Department, as well as chair and vice chair of the UCSC Academic Senate. Just prior to her current appointment, Alison served as Vice Provost of Academic Affairs and Dean of University Extension.<br/>
<br/>
 Throughout her tenure as CP/EVC, Alison had continued to be one of the nation's leading forensic scientists. She is frequently asked by law enforcement officials to analyze and identify human remains. Because many of the cases she works on are homicides, she has referred to her work as "giving voice to victims." Alison earned her Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Arizona and her B.A. in anthropology from UC Berkeley.<br/>
<br/>
 A search committee for the national recruitment of a new CP/EVC will be convened and announced soon. In the meantime, please join me in expressing appreciation to Alison for her many outstanding contributions to UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="44860d3e8072701721067acf1aac9703"><name>classroom-without-walls</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A classroom without walls</title><summary>Imagine studying California's richly diverse landscapes, from sea to Sierra, right in the thick of the actual habitat.</summary><keywords>California Ecology and Conservation course, Don Croll, Gage Dayton</keywords><start-date>1444201200000</start-date><display-name>A classroom without walls</display-name><path>/2015/10/classroom-without-walls</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/classroom-without-walls</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1444258647323</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1444259182943</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Terri Hunter-Davis, UC Newsroom</name><title></title><phone/><email>Terri.Hunter-Davis@ucop.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/nrs-class-425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/nrs-class-425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nrs-class-425.jpg</name><display-name>nrs-class-425.jpg</display-name><file-size>81296</file-size><width>425</width><height>260</height></image><image-alt>Class at Bodega Marine Reserve</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/nrs-class-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/nrs-class-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nrs-class-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>nrs-class-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18700</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Class at Bodega Marine Reserve</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>The Bodega Marine Reserve is one of several field sites visited by students in the California Ecology and Conservation course, offered through the UC Natural Reserve System.</span> (Photo by Don Croll)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Imagine studying California's richly diverse landscapes, from sea to Sierra &#8212; and not in the confines of a classroom, but right in the thick of the actual habitat.<br/>
<br/>
 That's exactly what the immersive California Ecology and Conservation course offers. Students from across the UC system spend seven weeks living and learning at <a href="http://nrs.ucop.edu/">UC's natural reserves</a>, in habitats ranging from rocky coast and freshwater marsh to oak savanna, conifer forest, and desert.<br/>
<br/>
 Participants learn about plant and animal ecology, conservation science, climate, California ecosystems and more.<br/>
<br/>
 The course, offered by UC's Natural Reserve System for the first time this fall, is akin to study abroad in reverse: Students are immersed in a "foreign" culture that's right at hand. And much like one might practice language skills and observe customs in another country, participants get the opportunity to practice field techniques and observe the environment in preparation for scientific research.<br/>
<br/>
 This term, the course is taught by Blake Suttle (who will lead next term's course), Don Croll and Gage Dayton from UC Santa Cruz. It is open to undergraduates from any UC campus &#8211; but don't delay: Enrollment (capped at 27 students) for the spring 2016 course closes Oct. 30.<br/>
<br/>
 Michael May, a fifth-year student at UC San Diego, "thought [the course] would end up being a sheltered version of what actual ecologists do." Far from it: "We have been thrown right into the life of a field ecologist," he said.<br/>
<br/>
 Classmate Hannah Spinner, a sophomore at UC Berkeley, agreed. "I&#8217;ve never learned so much in such a short time with such incredible people," she said. "The first day at the Angelo Coast Reserve, we thought of, executed, and presented a small research project to a class. In any other class this would take days."</p>
<p><strong>Enroll now</strong><br/>

The award will be presented at the AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco in December.</p>
<p>The Dansgaard Award recognizes exceptional promise for continued leadership in paleoceanography or paleoclimatology and contributions to the field such as research impact, innovative interdisciplinary work, educational accomplishments and mentoring, and societal impact.</p>
<p>"In addition to being a leading scientific figure in our discipline, Dr. Paytan also finds time to contribute to substantial outreach, education, and professional service," wrote Figen Mekik, president-elect of the AGU's Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology group, in a letter of commendation. "Dr. Paytan is a well-respected, prolific scientist and mentor who tirelessly promotes the professional growth and success of her students and colleagues and contributes to the leadership in paleoceanography and paleoclimatology."</p>
<p>Encompassing both marine and terrestrial ecosystems, Paytan's research includes studies of groundwater discharge into coastal systems, nutrient cycling, ocean acidification, and paleoceanography. She has over 160 scientific publications in prestigious journals such as <em>Science, Nature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, and <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. Since 2001, she has supervised more than 20 students receiving graduate degrees and 12 postdoctoral scientists, and she currently advises 10 graduate students, three postdocs, and several undergraduate students.</p>
<p>"Paleoceanography is a fascinating field of research," Paytan said. "It is a humbling endeavor to try and read the pages of Earth's history from indirect clues preserved in rocks, mud, and fossils."</p>
<p>These records, she said, hold the key to a better understanding of one of the most fascinating questions of all time: How does our planet work?</p>
<p>"It is a great honor to be a participant in this grand challenge of understanding the processes and feedbacks operating in the Earth system and how they relate to global changes in climate and tectonics," Paytan said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="497a3c978072701721067acf04c90cbf"><name>vawa-revisions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Systemwide review of proposed revisions to Presidential Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence</title><summary>The University invites comments on the proposed revisions to the Presidential Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence.</summary><start-date>1444287600000</start-date><display-name>Presidential Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence</display-name><path>/2015/10/vawa-revisions</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/vawa-revisions</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1444341759082</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1444778945100</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University invites comments on the proposed revisions to the Presidential Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence. This policy applies to all members of the UC community. &#160;</p>
<p>The proposed revisions are intended to update the policy in accordance with the Final Regulations for implementing the requirements of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) reauthorized by President Obama in 2013. These Final Regulations were issued by the U.S. Department of Education on October 20, 2014 and became effective July 1, 2015.&#160;</p>
<p>Additionally, proposed revisions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>incorporate any new VAWA regulations and recent legislation requirements.&#160;</li>
<li>assure that the policy is consistent with the efforts of the President&#8217;s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault.</li>
<li>reorganize the Policy for clarity.</li>
<li>update the definition of consent and add additional definitions to improve readability, consistency and understanding.&#160;</li>
<li>include an &#8220;amnesty&#8221; provision for reporting as per California Statute for students and applies the amnesty possibility for faculty and staff.</li>
<li>clarify that the policy addresses only harassment that is sexual in nature, as required by VAWA.</li>
<li>comply with the President&#8217;s directive to disclose disciplinary actions to complainants.</li>
</ul>

<p>Embedded in the Arts Division&#8217;s <a href="http://havc.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>History of Art and Visual Culture Department</strong></em></a>, its aim is to develop useful research tools to examine how cultural practitioners&#8212;filmmakers, new media strategists, photojournalists, architects, writers, activists, and interdisciplinary theorists&#8212;are critically addressing and creatively negotiating environmental concerns such as global warming and habitat destruction.</p>
<p>On October 13-27, the Center will present <em><strong>Global Climate Justice Today</strong></em>, a series of free public talks exploring the current meanings of climate justice for communities ranging from California to the Ecuadorian Amazon.</p>
<p>The concept of climate justice is built on the realization that addressing environmental change must include the consideration of structural inequalities, and that any solution must prioritize political and economic justice, as well as the participation of those most vulnerable to environmental impacts.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this series will address ongoing questions relevant to artists and activists alike, such as:</p>
<p>&#8226; How have new legal orders&#8212;such as the rights of nature enshrined recently in the constitutions of Ecuador and Bolivia&#8212;bolstered Indigenous environmental activism, as well as been contradicted by government-supported resource extraction as in Ecuador&#8217;s Yasuni National Park?</p>
<p>&#8226; How is climate change being currently addressed within religious communities in the North inspired by Pope Francis&#8217; influential 2015 Encyclical on the Environment?</p>
<p>&#8226; How does climate change relate to histories of colonial violence and how is this legacy being challenged presently?</p>
<p>&#8226; What creative ecologies exist within artistic-activist practice that provide resources for addressing climate justice today?</p>
<p>The series is curated by History of Art and Visual Culture professor <a href="http://havc.ucsc.edu/faculty/tj-demos"><strong><em>T.J. Demos</em></strong></a>, who is also the director of the Center for Creative Ecologies at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Demos writes on contemporary art, visual culture, and global politics. He is the author of <em>The Migrant Image: The Art and Politics of Documentary During Global Crisis</em> (2013), <em>Return to the Postcolony: Spectres of Colonialism in Contemporary Art</em> (2013), and a new book, titled <em>Decolonizing Nature: Contemporary Art and Political Ecology</em>, due out later this year.</p>
<p>He co-curated <em>Rights of Nature: Art and Ecology in the Americas</em>, at Nottingham Contemporary, one of Britain&#8217;s largest and leading centers for contemporary art, in January 2015, and organized <em>Specters: A Cin&#233;-Politics of Haunting</em>, at the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid in 2014.&#160;</p>
<p>Demos will participate in the series, along with featured guests:</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Valentin Lopez</strong> (Amah Mutsun Tribal Band)<br/>
 &#8226; <strong>Flora Lu</strong> (UC Santa Cruz)<br/>

Accreditation is a system of quality assurance where the campus defines educational goals and shows that students progress to achieving those goals.</p>
<p>Our regional accreditor is the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) Senior College and University Commission, which includes most institutions in California, Hawaii, and the Pacific. UC Santa Cruz was previously reviewed 10 years ago, so this year we are being reviewed again.</p>
<p>The WASC review team is visiting campus this week, today through Thursday and is holding open forum meetings Wednesday Oct. 14 at McHenry Library.&#160; The open meetings are in Room 4286.; faculty from 1:15-2 p.m.; staff 2:15-3 p.m.; and students 3:15-4 p.m.</p>
<p>The focus of accreditation is the quality of education in degree programs&#8212;majors for undergraduates, and masters and doctoral degree programs for graduate students. University efforts are evaluated using a number of metrics, including how faculty ensure the effectiveness of the curriculum and approaches to teaching.</p>
<p>It is expected that each program explicitly defines what students should know or be able to do by the time they graduate. These skills and knowledge sets are called Program Learning Outcomes, and they are posted for every undergraduate major in both the course catalog and on the program webpages. Most graduate programs have posted their outcomes on their webpage and in their graduate handbook. For our students, these outcomes can provide the big picture of what they learn in that degree.</p>
<p>Our faculty don&#8217;t just say what they expect their students to know and be able to do, but they make sure that the curriculum provides sufficient opportunities for students to develop these skills, and they measure student progress. To evaluate graduating students&#8217; skills and knowledge, program faculty look at key assignments in the final year, such as a capstone project, an exam in a senior-level course, or a thesis.</p>
<p>Assessment of student learning provides information to faculty on the success of the program and where to focus efforts for improvement. The main goal of assessment is to ensure that students are learning effectively so that they graduate well prepared to pursue careers and/or continue on to graduate school.</p>
<p>&#160;Our faculty have made significant efforts in the past few years in developing program learning outcomes, conducting assessment, and using their results to inform faculty discussions and teaching practices. A number of programs are planning changes as a result of what they have learned from these assessments. In sum, our program faculty, who are the most qualified to define and assess the learning outcomes, have established a discipline-specific process for ensuring a high quality education for all students in a way that we believe is the most appropriate for a research university.</p>
<p class="paragraphtext">We are hosting our second annual Symposium on Assessment of Learning for faculty and graduate students on November 20, 2015, in collaboration with UC Merced. This annual event provides opportunities to discuss critical issues in teaching and assessment, to share approaches and results, and to envision future directions for our campuses.&#160;More details are available at: <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/irps/assessment/symposium2015.asp">http://planning.ucsc.edu/irps/assessment/symposium2015.asp</a></p>
<p>The accreditation review also looks more broadly at the campus, including processes such as advising, enrollment management, infrastructure, and faculty governance; overall graduation rates, and rates by different demographic subgroups, are monitored. Achieving accreditation assures that an institution meets high standards of quality and effectiveness, and is, for instance, important for student access to Federal financial aid and faculty access to Federal research funding.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6334d54a8072701721067acf585d2e5e"><name>improving-cybersecurity</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Important changes to improve cybersecurity</title><summary>The University of California has been working to address systemwide challenges in cyber-security and develop a culture to effectively manage and respond to these on-going threats.</summary><start-date>1444719600000</start-date><display-name>Important changes to improve cybersecurity</display-name><path>/2015/10/improving-cybersecurity</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/improving-cybersecurity</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1444773418277</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1444773418277</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>The University of California has been working to address systemwide challenges in cyber-security and develop a culture to effectively manage and respond to these on-going threats. A core element of President Napolitano's plan to strengthen the university's defenses and fortify against future cyberattacks is a new Cyber-Risk Governance Committee.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We would like to update you on three important recommendations that have emerged from the Cyber-Risk Governance Committee.</div>
<div></div>
<div>1) All of us have a responsibility to safeguard the information that's entrusted to us. All employees are now required to take Cyber-Security Awareness Training, which will be delivered through the UC Learning Center. The training should take about 50 minutes and must be completed by January 31, 2016. It will be required annually. We will soon share more details about the training and when it will be available.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Further, ITS managers will identify staff members responsible for our campus cyber-security so that those people can take UC-sponsored in-person technical training on IT security topics, taught by leading information security experts. Additionally, an IT Security Symposium on emerging security trends and approaches will be offered to all UC IT staff.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2) Each campus has appointed an individual to serve as a Cyber-Risk Responsible Executive (CRE). For our campus, Vice Chancellor for Information Technology Mary Doyle will serve in that role.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3) The UC system will pilot a cyber incident escalation protocol through the end of this calendar year. The protocol establishes a consistent means and clear responsibilities across UC for assessing, responding to, escalating, and communicating cyberattacks. In January, the Cyber-Risk Responsible Executives will meet and review the protocol for effectiveness and manageability, and recommend changes, if necessary.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Systemwide leaders recognize that it can be a challenge to balance the number of events that occur in a system of our size with the need to create a culture of reporting for visibility and measurability. The pilot is meant to see if we have the best approach.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Relevant staff members have been briefed on the protocol. However, it is equally important that everyone in our campus community <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/security/report.html">report all security incidents</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>These changes come in the midst of National Cyber Security Awareness Month, a time to think about all the technology-related threats we face in our professional and personal lives and a reminder to make sure we have the resources needed to stay safer and more secure online.</div>
<div></div>

I plan to send it each month to share news, celebrate achievements, and give you a heads up on campus issues.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m delighted to welcome everyone back to campus, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/fall2015-start.html"></a>as we celebrate our 50<sup>th</sup> year, and I especially want to welcome our 51st&#160;class &#8212; 3,600 freshmen, 1,150 transfers, and 550 graduate students. It&#8217;s a smart group distinguished by academic achievement and diversity. You are joining an exceptional teaching and research university committed to your success, (and I hope by now you are finding your way around this beautiful campus).</p>
<p>I am also excited to welcome 35 new faculty, each with an impressive background of scholarship and teaching.</p>
<p>At our <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/founders/">&#8220;Fiat Fifty&#8221; Founders Celebration</a> last weekend, I was fortunate to see many of the visionaries and trailblazers who helped found UC Santa Cruz. I enjoyed two full days of wonderful events, topped by the bestowing of the Fiat Lux award, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJCCrT1Eb_c">fabulous tribute to the pioneer staff and faculty</a>, who, 50 years ago, charted the course for the UC Santa Cruz of today. It was a spectacular weekend, and I could not be more proud of our campus.</p>
<p>Kathy Sullivan, Cowell &#8217;73, was a terrific master of ceremonies for the Fiat Fifty dinner on the East Field. After graduating, Kathy became a space shuttle astronaut, the first American woman to walk in space, and now heads the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. During her remarks, she shared how she was surprised to discover a love for science while at UC Santa Cruz, a discovery that ultimately led to her successful career.</p>
<p>Alice Waters, the incomparable restaurateur and food activist, winner of our Foundation Medal, called UC Santa Cruz a true leader in a &#8220;delicious revolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the excitement around our anniversary has led to some pretty impressive media coverage. The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-uc-anniversaries-20150923-story.html"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a> had an excellent article on our 50th, &#160;(alongside similar milestones at UC Irvine and Cal State San Bernardino.) The <a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/social-affairs/20150926/uc-santa-cruzs-inaugural-year-was-unlike-any-experience-before-or-since"><em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em></a> published nice stories before and after the Founders Celebration. And I hope you didn&#8217;t miss the amazing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/opinion/mark-bittman-the-roots-of-organic-farming.html"><em>New York Times</em> column and video</a> by food writer Mark Bittman on the farm and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.</p>
<p>When you watch the video you&#8217;ll notice that it was actually raining on the day Bittman visited. Until yesterday&#8217;s sprinkle, I think that was the last time we had seen rain. During this exceptional drought, everyone on campus has done a tremendous job conserving water, efforts that resulted in an award from the California Higher Education Sustainability Conference this summer.</p>
<p>We are poised for a great year ahead, and there are two campaigns I want to mention.</p>
<p>First, you&#8217;ll be seeing a new <a href="http://safe.ucsc.edu">&#8220;Consent is Sexy&#8221;</a> campaign on posters and other media around campus. As a campus we are committed to preventing and responding to sexual violence and sexual assault.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also be hearing more about the <a href="http://www.coolcampuschallenge.org/">Cool Campus Challenge</a>, a friendly, fun competition among all UC campuses aimed at reducing UC&#8217;s carbon footprint and creating a culture of sustainability across campuses.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is a tremendous place to learn, work, and excel. As the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> noted, we now leave the prestigious list of best universities under 50. (We were listed 2nd in the U.S.) As I told the reporter, our 50th anniversary recognizes adulthood &#8212; our campus has matured.</p>
<p>I encourage you all to attend, or even better, participate in the <a href="http://www.downtownsantacruz.com/slug/">Banana Slug Parade and Expo</a> on Sunday morning, October 25 to celebrate 50 years of partnership between the city and university. The city of Santa Cruz and the Downtown Association of Santa Cruz are organizing the celebration. Learn more at <a href="http://www.downtownsantacruz.com/slug/">http://www.downtownsantacruz.com/slug/</a>. It&#8217;s sure to be fun.</p>
<p>Look for my next message in November, and remember, you can always reach me at <a href="mailto:chancellor@ucsc.edu">chancellor@ucsc.edu</a>.

Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The David and Lucile Packard Foundation has awarded a Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering to Kristy Kroeker, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The Packard Fellowship, one of the nation's most prestigious honors for young faculty members, gives Kroeker $875,000 over the next five years to support her research on environmental change in dynamic environments and complex ecosystems. Kroeker is interested in how the rapidly accelerating changes in our environment will alter the fundamental ways that marine ecosystems work in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Ocean acidification</strong></p>
<p>Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are driving widespread changes in the temperature and chemistry of the oceans. Ocean acidification refers to changes in seawater chemistry occurring as surface waters absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. At the same time, global warming is raising ocean temperatures.</p>
<p>"Our ability to actually predict how ecosystems are going to be affected by something like ocean acidification or climate change is limited because ecosystems are inherently complex," Kroeker said. "The organisms in an ecosystem are all interconnected and responding to each other and to the environment in which they live, and it's hard to predict what's going to happen when you overlay ocean acidification and climate change on top of that."</p>
<p>With the Packard funding, Kroeker plans to conduct large-scale studies of marine ecosystems to understand how these global changes will affect not only individual species but complex assemblages of multiple species. She noted that various environmental changes can have different and sometimes opposing patterns of occurrence and effects on species, yet they are often studied in isolation. "While many species are already responding to warming trends by shifting into cooler climates, ocean acidification is progressing most rapidly in these cooler environments," she said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Kelp forests</strong></p>
<p>Kroeker plans to study how kelp forest communities are organized across their entire range, from Alaska to Baja California. Kelp forests are important not only to marine life but also to people, supporting fisheries and coastal economies. By studying kelp forests in environments ranging from warm to cold and from low to high acidity, she hopes to gain an understanding of how these ecological communities work and how they are likely to respond to cumulative stresses.</p>
<p>"One thing we know is that change in ecological communities is unlikely to be gradual," Kroeker said. "Climate change is happening fairly gradually, but ecological communities don't change that way. We tend to see sudden shifts or tipping points."</p>
<p>If scientists can develop a better understanding of how ecosystems work in all their complexity, they'll be less likely to be caught off guard by dramatic shifts in major ecosystems. "If we understand how all these things combine, maybe we can predict when some of these shifts are likely to occur and develop strategies to minimize the impacts on people," Kroeker said.</p>
<p>The Packard Fellowships are among the nation's largest nongovernmental fellowships, designed to allow maximum flexibility in how the funding is used. Kroeker is the 11th UCSC faculty member to receive a Packard Fellowship, awarded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation to support young scientists and engineers who show exceptional promise and creativity. Previous recipients include astronomers Charlie Conroy in 2013 and Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz in 2008.</p>
<p>Kroeker earned her B.S. in marine biology at UC Santa Cruz in 2000 and her Ph.D. in biology at Stanford University. She joined the UCSC faculty in 2014.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.packard.org/what-we-fund/conservation-and-science/science/packard-fellowships-for-science-and-engineering/fellows-highlights/2015-packard-fellowships-in-science-and-engineering-awarded-to-eighteen-researchers/</url><title>Packard Foundation Announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/kristy-kroeker-295x120.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/kristy-kroeker-295x120.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kristy-kroeker-295x120.jpg</name><display-name>kristy-kroeker-295x120.jpg</display-name><file-size>11567</file-size><width>295</width><height>120</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Kristy Kroeker</thumb-alt><title>Kristy Kroeker</title><description>Kristy Kroeker was awarded an $875,000 Packard Fellowship to support her research on environmental change in dynamic environments and complex ecosystems.

<p>She remembers the years when her father, Jose Cervantes, would have to cross and re-cross the Mexican border just to find work to sustain the family.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, she did well in high school and got into UC Santa Cruz. After her first year here, she got a confidence boost when she got a prestigious summer internship at the Genome Technology Center at Stanford University with the help of two caring mentors.</p>
<p>Her two summers at Stanford eventually led her to the research she is doing today at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology Department.</p>
<p>"It's been a long road, but I'm happy to be here," said Cervantes (College Eight '16, molecular, cell and developmental biology).</p>
<p>Her research focuses on evolution, which can be mimicked in the laboratory by introducing a variation into a gene.</p>
<p>Using a rapidly-dividing organism such as E. coli or yeast as a host allows scientists to go though many generations of evolution in the laboratory. This approach is known as &#8220;directed evolution.&#8221; It is valuable for exploring the evolution of drug resistance, with applications in everything from laundry detergents to metabolic engineering.</p>
<p>She hopes her research will help people fine-tune protein functionality, a goal with broad health-based and industrial applications as it will help predict the evolutionary trajectory of rapidly evolving bacteria.</p>
<p>She admits it wasn&#8217;t easy for her at first. While she had all the support and encouragement of her family to go to college, she never acquired the study habits necessary to succeed academically. At one point, early on in her studies, her GPA dropped to a 2.8 because of a lack of good study techniques and reluctance to reach out for assistance.</p>
<p>"I underestimated how challenging it would be, and unfortunately I have a very hard time asking for help," she said.</p>
<p>She overcame this trepidation thanks to Zia Isola, director of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Research Mentoring Institute and Diversity Awards, which serves outstanding undergraduate and graduate students from any discipline who are interested in pursuing research projects in areas relevant to the human genome.</p>
<p>The beginning of Cervantes&#8217;s research career at UC Santa Cruz started with a caring and observant professor, Manel Camps, associate professor in microbiology and environmental toxicology, who recognized her talent and potential and decided to give her a chance.</p>
<p>Now his faith in her, combined with Cervantes&#8217;s strong resolve, are paying off.</p>
<p>Camps, who is also the provost of Crown College, was not at all surprised when Cervantes, whom he considers a "great scientist," was given a prestigious Undergraduate Research Award this year for her work.</p>
<p>He knew Cervantes faced a bit of a "psychological barrier" because of her humble upbringing and lack of academic role models growing up. She liked her research but felt unsure about her abilities as scientist in an academic environment.</p>
<p>But the research award&#8212;made possible by a generous private contribution&#8212;gave her the chance to prove herself. The award included a cash prize that enabled Cervantes to attend the Emerging Researchers Conference in Washington, D.C., in February. The conference added another layer to her growing confidence. It was a venue for her to share her work with scientists all over the country, including one who invited her to apply to the graduate school where he teaches.</p>
<p>Cervantes attributes her success to the mentors she has had, to her best friend, her parents, and sisters. All have given her the strength she needed for the rigors of long-term experiments and demanding academic life.</p>
<p>&#160;In the opinion of Camps,&#160; Cervantes has "great hands." He uses this informal expression to talk about her reliability, resolve, talent, and strong work ethic in his lab. &#8220;Science seems to be her natural habitat,&#8221; he said.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;Cervantes agreed, saying, "Science is a comfort for me.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6cd51ca58072701721067acfb4d86ee5"><name>benner-book</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>More than economics: New book explores how equality helps economies grow</title><summary>Communities that know together, grow together is the premise of UC Santa Cruz professor Chris Benner’s new book, 'Equity, Growth, and Community: What the Nation Can Learn From America’s Metro Areas.'</summary><start-date>1444935000000</start-date><display-name>Chris Benner</display-name><path>/2015/10/benner-book</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/benner-book</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1444934917254</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1444937320893</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value><value>Sociology</value><value>Community Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdwitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/Benner_Chris-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/Benner_Chris-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Benner_Chris-300.jpg</name><display-name>Benner_Chris-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>111618</file-size><width>300</width><height>434</height></image><image-alt>Chris Benner</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/Benner_Chris-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/Benner_Chris-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Benner_Chris-80.jpg</name><display-name>Benner_Chris-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>17654</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Chris Benner</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Chris Benner, professor of environmental studies and director of the Everett Program at UC Santa Cruz.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/equity-growth-cover-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/equity-growth-cover-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>equity-growth-cover-300.jpg</name><display-name>equity-growth-cover-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>111072</file-size><width>300</width><height>451</height></image><image-alt>book cover</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Communities that know together, grow together is the premise of UC Santa Cruz professor Chris Benner&#8217;s new book, <em>Equity, Growth, and Community: What the Nation Can Learn From America&#8217;s Metro Areas</em> (University of California Press, 2014).<br/>
<br/>
 Benner, a professor of environmental studies and sociology, co-wrote the book with Manuel Pastor, a UCSC alumnus and former UCSC professor now with the University of Southern California. <em>Equity, Growth, and Community</em> looks at almost 200 U.S. metropolitan regions to better understand what makes a city economically sustainable. The authors argue that long-term economic growth during the 1990s and 2000s is tied to &#8220;epistemic,&#8221; or knowledge communities.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Our research suggests that such communities &#8211; ones that are diverse in their membership and sources of knowledge, and dynamic in their ability to withstand shocks, continuously learn, and adjust over time &#8211; can actually help construct and sustain regional social norms that facilitate the achievements of growth, resilience, and inclusion,&#8221;&#160; Benner and Pastor write.<br/>
<br/>
 In other words, ideas matter.<br/>
<br/>
 The more diverse ideas a community can develop and share, the more it can cooperate and collaborate. The more a region can work together, the more equal it will be. And, the authors suggest,&#160; the more equal an area is, the more an economy will expand.<br/>
<br/>
 Benner and Pastor&#8217;s book is one of the first titles to be offered online for download free of charge by a new UC Press open-access publishing platform called Luminos that disseminates&#160; social science and &#8203;humanities research in a digital format.<br/>
<br/>
 Funding for Luminos titles is shared among multiple entities including libraries, said Ivy Anderson, interim executive director of UC's California Digital Library. &#8220;The Luminos funding model is a wonderful example of the kind of innovation that is needed to identify sustainable models for academic publishing in the future,&#8221; she said.<br/>
<br/>
 In their research, Benner and Pastor visited 11 regions across the U.S. to better understand how a community responded to specific issues choking growth. A jobs crisis, political fragmentation, education and income disparities, or all of the above &#8211; present new problems to communities. How quickly cities respond to these challenges is related to how equal and epistemic its community is.<br/>
<br/>
 For example, they found that Salt Lake City and Sacramento are examples of effective city and community planning. Grand Rapids, Mich.,&#160; Charlotte, N.C. and Oklahoma City show how business can drive regional stewardship. In Greensboro, N.C., Fresno, and San Antonio, the authors discovered that partnership is possible even in conditions of conflict. Silicon Valley, Raleigh-Durham, and Seattle offered novel ways to collaborate in a new information-based economy.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;We find that one of the most important factors that can shorten a growth spell is a region&#8217;s initial level of inequality,&#8221; say Benner and Pastor. &#8220;We also find that measures of social cohesion, including residential segregation, fragmented metropolitan governance, and sharp difference in city-suburb poverty levels, all play a role.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 As inequality in the U.S. continues to dramatically expand, Benner and Pastor&#8217;s analysis is a timely response to show how regions can successfully come together to make for a better community and country.</p>
<p>Benner joined UC Santa Cruz last year from UC Davis and holds the Dorothy E. Everett Chair in Global Information and Social Entrepreneurship. He is the director of the Everett Program, dedicated to building social innovation through technology.</p>
<p>Benner and Pastor previously collaborated on <em>Just Growth: Inclusion and Prosperity in America&#8217;s Metropolitan Region</em> (Routledge, 2012).</p>

 Our 2015-2016 Winter Campus Curtailment is scheduled for December 24, 2015 through January 3, 2016:<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 &#8226; December 24, 25, 31 and January 1 are paid university holidays (if eligibility criteria are met)<br/>
 &#8226; December 28, 29, and 30 are not paid university holidays<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 These curtailment days may result in employees using vacation, accrued compensatory time off, or leave without pay for December 28, 29 and 30, 2015. For employees who may not have sufficient accumulated vacation, up to three days of vacation leave may be used in advance of actual accruals during the campus curtailment period.&#160; In addition, those employees who are normally required to wait six months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their accrued vacation hours even if the required waiting period has not been completed.<br/>
<br/>
 Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during campus curtailment.<br/>
<br/>
 Units planning to maintain operations as usual during the campus curtailment period must receive approval from their respective principal officer or designee and should refer to the "Exceptions to Campus Closure" memo that will be forthcoming from Physical Plant. This memo will explain the required procedure to ensure that heat is supplied to appropriate working areas.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 This year&#8217;s winter curtailment period will affect the delivery of monthly paid employee paper paychecks.&#160; These checks will be available for pick-up at the Payroll Office, 2300 Delaware Ave. from 9 to 11 a.m. on Wednesday December 30. &#160;A picture ID is required.&#160; Paychecks that are not picked up will be delivered to the appropriate campus unit on Tuesday January 5, 2016.&#160; More information is available on the Financial Affairs website, <a href="https://financial.ucsc.edu/Pages/Payroll_Direct_Deposit.aspx">https://financial.ucsc.edu/Pages/Payroll_Direct_Deposit.aspx &#160;</a><br/>

<p>Of course it all starts with an idea, but there are also countless behind-the-scenes deals that contribute to making it happen.</p>
<p>On Friday, November 6, in partnership with the Arts Division, six executives in the entertainment business--including several UC Santa Cruz alums--will share their knowledge with students and the community in a special panel discussion at the Music Center Recital Hall.</p>
<p>Titled <em><strong>The Business of Entertainment</strong>,</em> it will cover the many hidden aspects of &#8216;making the deal&#8217;--such as content creation; what convinces a network executive to acquire a project; legal aspects of protecting directors, on-air and creative talent; and the challenges and pitfalls of physical production and distribution.</p>
<p>"As I have reconnected with many of our alumni in the film and television industry over the years, it was clear that they wanted to not only financially support our efforts in the arts, but also find a way to be involved with our students,&#8221; noted UC Santa Cruz arts dean David Yager.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time, our students need more exposure to real-life industry experience, so putting together this panel was a way to address both of these needs. It&#8217;s truly a win-win, for both our alumni and our students.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am extremely grateful to our panelists who are giving so generously of their time and expertise,&#8221; Yager added.&#160;&#8220;Our students have the opportunity to gain a better understanding of how their studies may lead to a career in the film or television industry. For some of our students this could be life-changing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The panel will be moderated by Emmy-nominated UC Santa Cruz alumnus <strong>Brannon Braga</strong>, who recently received a <em><a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/07/braga-peabody-award.html"><strong>Peabody Award</strong></a> &#160;</em>as executive producer and director for the science documentary television series, <em>Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey</em>.</p>
<p>A creator, writer and executive producer of more than 300 episodes of the <em>Star Trek</em> series, Braga is currently a writer, executive producer, and co-creator of the drama series <em>Salem</em>, WGN America&#8217;s first original scripted series. His film credits include <em>Mission: Impossible II</em>, <em>Star Trek: Generations,</em> and <em>Star Trek: First Contact</em>.</p>
<p>The panelists will include <strong>Andrew Z. Davis</strong>, President of Production Administration at Sony Studio&#8217;s Columbia and TriStar Pictures. Davis has executive produced such films as <em>In Time</em>, starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried; the comedies <em>Your Highness</em>, starring James Franco, Danny McBride and Natalie Portman and <em>Role Models</em> starring Paul Rudd; the critically acclaimed coming-of-age drama, <em>Love &amp; Basketball;</em> and <em>Enemy of the State</em>. His other producer credits include <em>Sid and Nancy</em> and <em>Tapeheads</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Steven Lafferty</strong> is a partner and managing director at Creative Artists Agency (CAA). He oversees the television department, which represents many of the world&#8217;s most accomplished actors, writers, producers, directors, and production companies. CAA&#8217;s clients have created, executive produced, or starred in many of the most popular shows on television, including <em>Empire, The Walking Dead, Orange Is The New Black, Scandal, Grey&#8217;s Anatomy, The Good Wife, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, American Idol, CSI, House of Cards, and Veep</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Jon Moonves</strong> is a senior partner at one of the nation&#8217;s premier entertainment law firms, Del, Shaw, Moonves, Tanaka, Finkelstein &amp; Lezcano. He represents actors, comedians, digital influencers, writers, producers, executives, and production groups in all aspects of the film, digital and television industries. Moonves has been consistently named to <em>Variety&#8217;s</em> &#8220;Hollywood Impact List&#8221;, <em>The Hollywood Reporter&#8217;s</em> &#8220;Power Lawyer&#8221; list, and &#8220;The Best Lawyers in America&#8221; list as one of the nation&#8217;s top entertainment lawyers.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz alumna <strong>Jennie Morris</strong> is Executive Vice President of Acquisitions, Research and Network Operations for the television network, Pivot. A seasoned television executive, she has nearly two decades of experience in domestic and international programming and marketing. Prior to joining Pivot, she was Vice President of Marketing for AMC/Sundance Channel Global, as well as Senior Director of Program Planning and Scheduling for the Sundance Channel. Earlier in her career, she also spent six years at Showtime Networks working in programming, international and new media departments.</p>
<p><strong>David Korduner</strong> earned a B.A. with Honors in Economics from UC Santa Cruz (1985), a M.Sc. in Regional and Urban Planning Studies from The London School of Economics and Political Science (1987), and a J.D. from the UCLA School of Law (1992).

<p>UC Santa Cruz is No. 8 nationwide and the second in the state with a Social Mobility Index of 81 percent.</p>
<p>The SMI is computed from five variables: published tuition, percent of student body whose families are below the US median income, graduation rate, reported median salary zero-to-five years after graduation, and endowment, according to CollegeNET. The first two variables are weighted the highest.</p>
<p>Tuition and fees at UC Santa Cruz are $13,398, and 41 percent of its undergraduate students are from low-income families. The median early career salary for UC Santa Cruz graduates is $48,400.</p>
<p>Some of the top employers of UC Santa Cruz alumni include Apple, Google, Kaiser Permanente, and Cisco, according to LinkedIn. Some of the top fields include education, research, and media and communications.</p>
<p>CollegeNET&#8217;s Social Mobility Index differs from most other rankings by focusing directly and broadly on the problem of economic mobility.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="72ea7586807270176d1201787f106a5b"><name>ocean-circulation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Formation of coastal sea ice in North Pacific drives ocean circulation and climate</title><summary>New understanding of changes in North Pacific ocean circulation could lead to better global climate models.</summary><keywords>Christina Ravelo, Karla Knudson, Bering Sea, NPIW, North Pacific Intermediate Water</keywords><start-date>1445353200000</start-date><display-name>Formation of coastal sea ice in North Pacific drives ocean circulation and climate</display-name><path>/2015/10/ocean-circulation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/ocean-circulation</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1445036979550</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1445356362651</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/coastal-sea-ice-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/coastal-sea-ice-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coastal-sea-ice-450.jpg</name><display-name>coastal-sea-ice-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>76102</file-size><width>450</width><height>299</height></image><image-alt>coastal sea ice</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/coastal-sea-ice-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/coastal-sea-ice-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coastal-sea-ice-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>coastal-sea-ice-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15542</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>coastal sea ice</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The formation of coastal sea ice, seen here in the Arctic Ocean, plays an important role in driving "overturning circulation" in the North Pacific Ocean.

Coastal sea ice formation takes place on relatively small scales, however, and is not captured well in global climate models, according to scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who conducted the study.</p>
<p>A paper on the new findings will be published in a future issue of the journal <em>Paleoceanography</em> and is <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015PA002840/abstract">currently available online</a>.</p>
<p>"We have identified an important process that current global climate models don't adequately capture. Coastal sea ice formation may be important to future climate change because the arctic and subarctic regions are warming at twice the rate of other parts of the world," said first author Karla Knudson, a graduate student in Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Cold deep water</strong></p>
<p>When sea ice forms, it expels salt into the surrounding water, increasing the density of the water and causing it to sink, carrying oxygenated surface water into the depths. One result is a flow of cold deep water toward the equator and warm surface water toward the poles, and this "overturning circulation" plays a crucial role in moving heat around the globe.</p>
<p>"It helps to modulate the climate by transferring heat from the equator to the poles," said coauthor Christina Ravelo, professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>This process (also called "thermohaline circulation") has received less attention in the North Pacific than in the North Atlantic, where the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water is a powerful driver of global ocean circulation and climate. In the North Pacific, overturning circulation driven by formation of the North Pacific Intermediate Water is not as strong as in the North Atlantic, but it plays a major role in the region's climate.</p>
<p>In 2009, when Ravelo led an expedition of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) to the Bering Sea (with co-chief scientist Kozo Takahashi of Kyushu University, Japan), one of her main goals was to investigate the role of the North Pacific Intermediate Water in climate change. The expedition drilled sediment cores from the floor of the Bering Sea that preserve records of the regional climate and ocean circulation covering the past 1.2 million years, much longer than any other oceanographic records from that region. By analyzing these records, Knudson and Ravelo found that the strength of the overturning circulation in the North Pacific is inherently linked to global climate changes, but not in the way scientists had previously thought.</p>
<p><strong>Climate cycles</strong></p>
<p>The sediment cores used in this study cover a period when the planet went through many climate cycles driven by variations in Earth's orbit, from extreme glacial periods such as the Last Glacial Maximum about 20,000 years ago, when massive ice sheets covered the northern parts of Europe and North America, to relatively warm interglacial periods with climates more like today's.</p>
<p>Previous studies based on global climate models indicated that the overturning circulation in the North Pacific and North Atlantic responded in opposite ways to major shifts in global climate. During glacial periods, sea level falls as water gets locked up in the ice sheets, and in extreme cases the Bering Strait connecting the Bering Sea to the Arctic Ocean closes and becomes a land bridge. This shuts off the flow of relatively fresh North Pacific water into the saltier North Atlantic, leading to increased salinity in the North Atlantic and stronger overturning circulation there.</p>
<p>At the same time, the thinking went, a fresher North Pacific would have weaker circulation. This oceanic "seesaw" would result in a cooling effect in one ocean and a warming effect in the other. But that's not what the sediment cores revealed. "We found that the overturning circulation actually strengthens in both oceans when the Bering Strait is closed," Knudson said.</p>
<p>What the climate models were missing, she said, was the strong brine production from sea ice formation in the Bering Sea. The global climate models do a good job of simulating the process of sea ice formation over large areas in the open ocean. But the critical coastal process, which actually generates more of the deep water, occurs on smaller scales and is only captured in high-resolution regional climate models, Knudson said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Sea of Okhotsk</strong></p>
<p>The Bering Sea is less important during warm periods like today, when wintertime sea ice formation in the Sea of Okhotsk generates most of the North Pacific Intermediate Water. But the same process of sea ice formation and brine production along coastal shelves plays a critical role wherever it occurs.</p>
<p>"These small-scale processes might be important to understanding the full impact of climate change," Ravelo said. "As the climate gets warmer, we could see reduced sea ice formation in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Arctic. So it would be nice for the climate models to have sufficient resolution to be able to predict the impact of changes in coastal sea ice."</p>
<p>Knudson and Ravelo based their findings on an analysis of carbon and oxygen isotopes in the calcium carbonate shells of tiny marine organisms called foraminifera, which are preserved in seafloor sediments. Chemical signatures of the ocean water the organisms lived in are locked into the composition of their shells, and researchers can analyze them for evidence of past water temperatures and other oceanographic conditions.</p>

<p>First came the arrival of the U.S. Navy during World War II, bringing hundreds of ships, thousands of men, bulldozers that scoured runways through taro patches, and landing barges that scraped angrily over delicate coral reefs.</p>
<p>Then it was the importation of rice and Spam to supplement the taro fields and fishing that were lost. Along with that came cash payments so the people who&#8217;d once fished with canoes now bought motorboats, nets, and freezers, leaving behind their old ways of catching fish.</p>
<p>Climate change and ocean acidification arrived next so that, by the first decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, those who lived on the atoll not only noticed an alarming decline in their fish catch but also a rise in hypertension and diabetes.</p>
<p>Thanks to help from a dedicated group of scientists, led by UC Santa Cruz Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Giacomo Bernardi and his wife, Cabrillo College Biology Professor Nicole Crane (College Eight &#8217;86, biology), the fish and traditions that, for centuries, sustained the ecological health of the islands &#8212; and the islanders &#8212; are now coming back.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the real deal,&#8221; Bernardi says of the five-year conservation effort dubbed &#8220;<a href="http://ulithimarineconservation.ucsc.edu/">One People One Reef</a>.&#8221; &#8220;These people are protecting their reefs in order that they can live.&#8221;</p>
<p>Along with four other scientist-friends, Bernardi and Crane arrived on the largest of the atoll&#8217;s islands, Falalop, in 2010 after days of travel that only the most Zen-like voyager could survive. They came at the invitation of islanders, armed with years of scientific knowledge, some basic equipment &#8212; and their kids.</p>
<p>The scientists enlisted the help of John Rulmal Jr. who lived on Falalop and who introduced them to the ins and outs of Ulithi culture &#8212; including the specific roles of men and women, and governance by local chiefs.</p>
<p>They dove on the reefs to record coral health and count fish. They talked with residents, watched their kids play with island children, and sweated for hours in the men&#8217;s meetinghouse as stories slowly emerged about old fishing traditions and the severity of problems the 1,000 or so people on the island faced.</p>
<p>What they did not do was to come up with some amazing, Western-based management plan. Instead, they simply reported what they found.</p>
<p>They explained to islanders how using motorboats, spear guns, and nets caused the depletion of certain fish, which was unhealthy for the ecology of the area. They noted how the high cost of fuel had concentrated fishing in a few areas and pointed to poor sewage treatment that allowed organic waste onto the reefs and encouraged the growth of algae. They described how certain fish were good for the reef and talked about how old traditions had kept the fishery in balance.</p>
<p>For instance, Crane says, tradition used to dictate that some reefs were closed at the death of a chief or an important person on the islands and that others were shut down during certain times of year. Complex rituals had also slowed fishing. For instance, the killing of a sea turtle used to require a blessing from a certain chief on a certain island. The long trip often gave turtle harvesters second thoughts.</p>
<p>Bernardi, Crane, and Rulmal enlisted women, who traditionally cleaned the fish the men caught, to help scientists measure and sex the day&#8217;s catch and keep records of what was taken. They laid out their findings about the health of the reef. &#160;</p>
<p>Then they left.</p>
<p>&#8220;We said (to the islanders): &#8216;We don&#8217;t want to tell you what to do. These are your islands, your reefs,'&#8221; Bernardi says. &#8220;'We are just going to tell you what we see.'&#8221;</p>
<p>When Bernardi and Crane came back a year later, the chief &#8212; after hours-long meetings with island residents &#8212; had set up a system of reef closures, which was already beginning to show an increase in fish populations.</p>
<p>&#8220;All we were doing was reviving tradition,&#8221; Crane says. &#8220;These people have been managing these reefs for thousands of years. It was the recent changes that had caused problems: changes in fishing technique, cultural changes, loss of traditional leadership, and the advent of money&#8230;All we did was reconnect them to traditional management which had always been very effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon word got out and other islands in the atoll requested the scientists&#8217; help. Since then, Bernardi and Crane have come back year after year, bringing other scientists and, once, a doctor to talk about nutrition and health.</p>
<p>While scientific data are still being collected in order to judge the effectiveness of the change, the islanders are now reporting an increase in the amount and type of fish they are catching, according to Crane.</p>
<p>Bernardi said proof of the effectiveness of the islanders&#8217; plan came in 2015 when super typhoon Maysak hit Ulithi head-on.&#160; Homes were washed into the sea, thousands of coconut trees were turned into stumps, and islanders lost their possessions.&#160; The chiefs opened the reserved fishing areas &#8220;and there were fish and that is what saved them,&#8221; Bernardi says.</p>
<p>The One People One Reef project, started with a $44,000 UC Pacific Rim grant, has now won more funding, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#8217;s Saltonstall-Kennedy award and a National Science Foundation grant. Recently, the program was selected as one of 15 semi-finalists out of 420 entries for the Buckminster Fuller Institute&#8217;s Fuller Challenge award.</p>
<p>As for the future, Crane sees the islanders &#8220;dancing a fine line between traditional cultural practices and the modern world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s reasonable to suggest they throw away their ties to Western culture and revert back to only traditional ways. I see, in the future, a way for them to bridge these two and bring their cultural knowledge into a modern context. They can, and are doing, something different than most of the world is doing when it comes to navigating these challenging times &#8212; bridging science with tradition their own way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they have a rare shot of making this work.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="820beb57807270176d12017821f61475"><name>AASHE-water-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus exceeds goal for water savings, seeks to do more</title><summary>The campus and its efforts to save water were recognized by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education.</summary><keywords>water, saving, award, drought</keywords><start-date>1445288400000</start-date><display-name>Campus exceeds goal for water savings</display-name><path>/2015/10/AASHE-water-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/AASHE-water-award</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1445290830645</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1445290830645</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/student-water-pledge-500px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/student-water-pledge-500px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>student-water-pledge-500px.jpeg</name><display-name>student-water-pledge-500px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>132865</file-size><width>499</width><height>301</height></image><image-alt>Student pledging to save water</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/Sammy-80px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/Sammy-80px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>Sammy-80px.jpeg</name><display-name>Sammy-80px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>11544</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sammy the Slug</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Today, total annual campus water use is 20 million gallons less than 20 years ago, even though campus population has grown.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC Santa Cruz, which has reduced its water usage by more than 25 percent, was recently recognized nationally as a top performer in water conservation</article-subhead><article-text><p>Like cities across California, UC Santa Cruz has been working hard to further reduce its water usage in the midst of the state's historic drought.</p>
<p>In the past fiscal year, the campus cut water use by 27 percent, exceeding the city's Stage 3 Water Emergency reduction goal of 25 percent, and water managers continue to look for ways to save even more.</p>
<p>The campus and its efforts were recognized as a top performer in conserving water and protecting water quality by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education and is featured in its 2015 Sustainable Campus Index.</p>
<p>The success is the result of hard work from people across campus who stepped up to help lower campus consumption in a variety of ways - reducing irrigation, encouraging behavior modification, sharing more information with users, and installing low-flow faucets, toilets, and pumps.</p>
<p>"Conserving water on campus is everyone's job," said Elida Erickson, interim director of sustainability. "In addition to reducing usage, the campus is looking at ways to harvest and reuse water."</p>
<p>Since spring 2014, a group of staff and students, has met monthly as the Water Working Group. Members come from all parts of campus - labs, the farm, the arboretum, housing and more. Santa Cruz Water Department conservation manager Toby Goddard offers an update on the city's usage and the status of the San Lorenzo River and the Loch Lomond reservoir.</p>
<p>The group shares campus usage and savings, and explores ways to do more.</p>
<p>In a recent meeting, Energy Manager Patrick Testoni reported that the campus is off to a strong start for the 2015-16 year, lowering its summer months' usage by a cumulative 24.3 percent.</p>
<p>"Achieving water reduction targets on campus requires effective engagement of students, staff, and faculty," Testoni said, "and our success speaks to the collaborative approach we have had between these groups on campus."</p>
<p>The Water Working Group put together a list of projects that could quickly reduce usage. The projects included laboratory equipment and ultra-low-flow toilets and faucets retrofits in some of the busiest campus areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, low-flow shower heads were installed in campus residence halls along with reminders to aim for a 5-minute shower.</p>
<p>The campus also has invested in cellular broadcasters connected to its 400 water meters that allows it to track usage across campus by the hour. This level of detail also alerts water managers to identify potential leaks. Several have been detected - and fixed - since the retrofits began in May.</p>
<p>Campus water use per capita has declined for more than a decade. The campus baseline use - a three-year average from fiscal years 2003-2005 - is 14,200 gallons per person a year.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2012, the campus used 9,100 gallons per person, a 36 percent reduction from the baseline. Today's per capita use is at about 8,400 gallons per year, a 40 percent decline from the baseline.</p>
<p>Today, total annual campus water use is 20 million gallons less than 20 years ago, even though campus population has grown.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="821279eb807270176d120178e30decce"><name>rev-fall-15-big-ideas-0815</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Big ideas</title><summary>From saving falcons to peering into the universe, sequencing the human genome, and putting organic food on American tables, UC Santa Cruz has become known as the small university where big things happen.</summary><keywords>falcons, astronomy, sequencing the human genome, organic food</keywords><start-date>1445238000000</start-date><display-name>Big ideas</display-name><path>/2015/10/rev-fall-15-big-ideas-0815</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/rev-fall-15-big-ideas-0815</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1445291260345</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1445291916637</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value><value>Ocean Sciences</value><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/ramirez-ruiz-enrico.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/ramirez-ruiz-enrico.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ramirez-ruiz-enrico.jpg</name><display-name>ramirez-ruiz-enrico.jpg</display-name><file-size>147079</file-size><width>380</width><height>380</height></image><image-alt>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz is chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, where innova</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/ramirez-ruiz-enrico-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/ramirez-ruiz-enrico-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ramirez-ruiz-enrico-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ramirez-ruiz-enrico-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24833</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz is chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, where innova</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz is chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, where innovative faculty have led breakthroughs in everything from telescope design to theoretical astrophysics.

<p>A private firm named Celera Genomics was beating a path to the prize with a big budget and what was reported to be the most powerful computer cluster in civilian use.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an international consortium of public scientists&#8212;which Haussler had only recently been invited to join&#8212;was lagging behind.</p>
<p>The public institutions assigned to write a program that would assemble the 600,000 fragments of DNA the consortium had decoded into a comprehensible sequence were having trouble. On top of that, the heads of Celera Genomics and the public consortium had agreed to jointly announce the results of their work at the White House on June 26. The deadline was approaching like a speeding bullet.</p>
<p>What happened next was the stuff of movies, and also a reflection of the kind of maverick, can-do ethos that has pervaded UC Santa Cruz for all of its 50-year history.</p>
<p>Haussler, a tall man with a penchant for Hawaiian shirts, managed to wrangle 100 Dell Pentium III processor workstations&#8212;each with less power than one of today's smart phones&#8212;and assemble a makeshift "supercomputer." He then started a behind-the-scenes attempt to write an assembly program. The going was slow, however.</p>
<p>Enter Jim Kent, an unruly-haired UC Santa Cruz graduate student in molecular, cell, and developmental biology. He worried that if a private corporation sequenced the human genome first, thousands of genes might be patented&#8212;meaning that, for a time at least, "open science" would have meant "open only to those who could pay."</p>
<p>On May 22, Kent, who'd cut his coding teeth in the commercial world of paint and animation programming, e-mailed Haussler saying he thought he had found a way to write an assembly program using a simpler strategy.</p>
<p>Haussler replied with one word: "Godspeed."</p>
<p>"So Jim went for it," Haussler said. "It was a classic scene. I knew Jim was a genius and I thought, 'It may be hopeless but, at this point, what have we got to lose?' Celera had one of the most powerful computer systems at the time, and we, basically, had 100 cell phones."</p>
<p>Kent spent the next month huddled in the garage office at his Seabright home, writing 10,000 lines of code so furiously and for so many hours, he had to ice his wrists.</p>
<p>On June 22, four days before the White House announcement&#8212;and three days before Celera finished its computer assembly&#8212;Kent ran the first successful draft sequence of the human genome using the UC Santa Cruz computer farm and 13 sets of data sources.</p>
<p>The announcement of the successful sequencing of the human genome was hailed around the world.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, on July 7, Haussler and Kent had the honor of posting the first human genome on the Internet. In September, they also debuted the UCSC Genome Browser, a graphic web-based "microscope" for exploring the human genome that continues to be free to anyone who wants it.</p>
<p>Today, thousands of biomedical researchers worldwide use the UCSC Genome Browser in their work to uncover the causes of disease and develop treatments. The browser has been mentioned in more than 20,000 different scholarly papers in biomedical literature, an indication of its impact in disease research. The site gets about a million hits per day.</p>
<p>It was an audacious achievement but not the only time UC Santa Cruz has beaten the odds to make a difference. From saving falcons to peering into the universe and putting organic food on American tables, UC Santa Cruz has become known as the small university where big things happen.</p>
<p>Here are just a few examples.</p>
<h3>Bring back the birds</h3>
<p>Peregrine falcons are the F-16s of nature. They can dive to speeds of up to 300 mph, snatch other birds out of mid-air, and have a ratcheting function in their feet that allows them to lock onto prey and hold it with very little energy.</p>
<p>But by 1970, there were only two breeding pairs left in California thanks to the pesticide DDT, which thinned the shells of the falcons' eggs, causing them to break under the weight of the nesting adult.</p>
<p>Today, there are nearly 300 productive pairs of the iconic bird, and their return is due in large part to a seat-of-the-pants organization started in 1975 on the UC Santa Cruz campus by the late Natural History Professor Ken Norris.</p>
<p>Like Haussler, the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, as it was known, had to MacGyver its way to success. Led by a tireless scientific researcher named Brian Walton, the group sent climbers up rock walls with homemade plywood backpacks to retrieve falcon eggs, which they would replace with fake eggs created by the UC Santa Cruz Art Department.</p>
<p>According to Glenn Stewart, now director of the program, the falcon eggs would then be transported by volunteers to the research group's makeshift headquarters in the Lower Quarry&#8212;which Norris had threatened to power with the "world's longest extension cord" until administrators agreed to supply electricity to the site. There, the eggs would be hatched in modified chicken incubators and the chicks warmed on heating pads placed in cement-mixing tubs. The birds would be fed with ground pigeon or quail meat raised by staff and volunteers, watched 24/7 by program employees and students, and finally transported back to the nest for their "rebirth," often to the surprise of their avian parents.</p>
<p>By 1999, the peregrine falcon had recovered enough to be removed from the federal endangered species list.</p>
<p>It was an impudent fight, headquartered on a campus known mostly for its lack of grades, and one that included a lot of improvisation, more than a few bent rules, and even the threat of arrest. (One volunteer was swarmed by a Los Angeles SWAT team while trying to capture pigeons from a freeway billboard in order to supplement the program's food budget.)</p>
<p>"It's one of the greatest environmental success stories of all time," Stewart said.</p>
<h3>In a galaxy&#8230;</h3>
<p>About the same time the peregrine falcon population was taking flight, a group of scientists from UC Santa Cruz were revolutionizing the way we studied the heavens.</p>
<p>Two physicists, Jerry Nelson and Terry Mast, had recently arrived on campus from UC Berkeley. The two had conceived a radical telescope design that used segmented, hexagonal mirrors to peer more deeply into space than ever before. The result was a multimillion-dollar project to build two of these breakthrough 10-meter telescopes on the slopes of Mauna Kea in Hawaii.</p>
<p>In order to work, the telescopes also needed precisely crafted secondary mirrors, and, even though a few outside companies could make them, UC Santa Cruz scientists decided to tackle the difficult assignment themselves.</p>
<p>Then&#8211;professor of astronomy Joe Miller remembered: "I said, 'We've got the well-equipped optical laboratory, a very experienced and great optician (Dave Hilyard), and superb support from Jerry Nelson, Terry Mast, and Harland Epps, who is the leading designer of astronomical optics in the U.S.'"</p>
<p>Today, the twin Keck telescopes use secondary mirrors built in a series of unassuming metal-roofed shops amid the redwoods of UC Santa Cruz. The Kecks are considered the most productive telescopes in the world.</p>
<p>Their success also inspired a new effort to build a 30-meter version of the Keck telescopes&#8212;an international endeavor with roots still deep in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>But secondary mirrors were not the only instruments born amid the woods. Instruments conceived by astronomer Steven Vogt and by National Medal of Science winner Sandra Faber have allowed researchers to discover scores of extrasolar planets, find direct evidence for the Hot Big Bang theory, and make major progress in mapping the evolution of the universe for the last 5 billion years.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was also at the vanguard of adaptive optics, technological advances that combat atmospheric distortion so the images scientists see through telescopes are sharp and clear.</p>
<p>"We've developed and built these absolutely forefront instruments," said Michael Bolte, UC Santa Cruz professor of astronomy and astrophysics, sitting in his campus office underneath a photo of one of the Keck telescopes. "The place where it all happened is right here."</p>
<h3>Lights, science, action</h3>
<p>Down the hill and a few years earlier, a couple of research biologists and confessed seabird freaks from UC Santa Cruz embarked on a mission that would grow to save 389 species from possible extinction on more than four dozen islands in the world.</p>
<p>It was the 1980s, and Don Croll and Bernie Tershy had loaded up their surfboards and headed to a pair of wind-wracked Mexican islands where feral cats were obliterating Cassin's Auklets, Scripps's Murrelets, and Black Storm-petrels.</p>
<p>The men knew what was happening on those specks of land was emblematic of a larger problem: Nowhere were extinctions greater than on the world's islands, home to 20 percent of bird, reptile, and plant species.</p>
<p>With the help of a legendary bobcat trapper, the determined but underfunded environmental tacticians went to work, managing to clear the islands of the destructive felines. Within five years, the two assembled a rag-tag team of graduate students, trappers, and Mexican conservationists, freeing nine islands off of Baja California of invasive rats, feral cats, rabbits, goats, and burros&#8212;allowing native birds and plants to return. They turned the group into a nonprofit called Island Conservation and established its headquarters in a rented space on the UC Santa Cruz marine-lab campus.</p>
<p>Today, Island Conservation is an independent, Santa Cruz&#8211;based nonprofit with a $6.5 million budget and projects around the world.</p>
<p>"To us, it was: Why apply science just to describe problems?" Croll said. "Using science to find solutions seemed way more interesting."</p>
<p>It was a culture born from early faculty like Michael Soul&#233;, a professor of environmental sciences known as the father of modern conservation biology, and the late Ken Norris, a UC Santa Cruz natural history professor who not only helped craft the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 but also co-founded the 756,000-acre UC Natural Reserve System, according to Croll.</p>
<p>Since then, the UC Santa Cruz researchers have helped bring about policy changes like a West Coast ban on fishing for krill, shrimp-like crustaceans that are a major food source for marine life, and are now working with postdoc Asha de Vos to examine a possible modification of shipping lanes that could help save Sri Lankan blue whales. Their students have helped stop construction of a liquefied natural gas plant in an environmentally sensitive area of Mexico and supported modification of rules so oil-spill money for seabird restoration can be used beyond spill boundaries to places the winged victims travel and breed.</p>
<p>"The ethos of this place is to encourage people to go out and do things," Croll said.</p>
<h3>Beyond bars</h3>
<p>When Psychology Professor Craig Haney arrived in Santa Cruz in 1977, he'd already witnessed the psychological damage prison could cause.</p>
<p>He had been one of the principal researchers in the famous Stanford Prison Experiment, which had student volunteers playing the roles of guards and inmates in a simulated prison setting, and which had to be halted because of the psychological mistreatment and breakdowns that ensued.</p>
<p>But now Haney found himself in the real world of prisons, talking to inmates in windowless solitary confinement cells where the smells of 23-hour-a-day living and a sense of grief created an almost palpable heaviness in the air.</p>
<p>He witnessed prisoners break under the pressures of isolation and documented how others clung to slivers of humanity by imposing an almost obsessive order on their solitary lives. He saw inmates transition from a fear of being alone to apprehension about being around people, and chronicled the rise of the use of isolation in prisons around the country.</p>
<p>In 2012, he told a U.S. Senate subcommittee that, for many inmates, "solitary confinement precipitates a descent into madness."</p>
<p>Haney's four decades of prison research has taken him from frightening prisons in Texas to medieval-looking facilities in Pennsylvania and to a federal supermax prison in Colorado. In California he saw men packed into a sweltering gymnasium with bunks stacked three high as armed guards patrolled catwalks above them.</p>
<p>"Men were living not for weeks or months but for years in these abysmally overcrowded, dangerous, and unhealthy environments," he said.</p>
<p>In 2011, Haney's testimony about the psychological effects of this kind of treatment became the cornerstone for a U.S. Supreme Court decision that forced California to reduce its prison populations because of cruel and inhumane conditions.</p>
<p>Sitting in his office in advance of a CNN interview about solitary confinement, Haney reflected on his work both inside and outside the university.</p>
<p>"I think when you see injustices that other people haven't, it's important to communicate those observations beyond an academic world," Haney said. "We have an obligation to share knowledge not just with students but with a larger society. Especially when that knowledge bears directly on things about which the public should know and care about."</p>
<h3>The past is present</h3>
<p>If you want to know about climate change, you may want to look deep into the Earth. That's what Christina Ravelo, UC Santa Cruz professor of ocean sciences, has done, and what she discovered has rattled the way scientists go about predicting the effects of climate shifts.</p>
<p>Ravelo, a paleoclimatologist with a shock of dark, curling hair, has spent countless hours studying sediment cores harvested from deep beneath the ocean in hopes the past would shed clues on the present. Her interest is in an epoch known as the Pliocene Warm Period 3.5 to 4.5 million years ago, when temperatures were a few degrees higher and CO2 levels roughly the same as today.</p>
<p>What she discovered was evidence of a permanent El Ni&#241;o&#8211;like state in the tropics with its resulting drought, floods, and damaging storms. Her discovery shook the scientific community because modern climate-prediction models did not forecast that kind of result.</p>
<p>"The issue has fueled a lot of debate and a lot of scrutiny about how Earth responds to high CO2 levels," said Ravelo. "There may be even more radical changes that the models aren't picking up yet because we haven't been able to simulate a tropical climate accurately. We're trying to figure out why the models and the data from the Pliocene don't agree."</p>
<p>Her findings, along with those made by her colleague Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences Jim Zachos, and her use of a laser system to analyze the geochemistry of fossils in order to understand climate and ocean dynamics, has put her&#8212;and UC Santa Cruz&#8212;on the forefront of climate research.</p>
<h3>Seed to table</h3>
<p>If you've ever picked up a carton of organic strawberries from your local supermarket, you have an eccentric English gardener, a passionate farmer/plant ecologist, and UC Santa Cruz to thank.</p>
<p>The odyssey of those strawberries began in 1967 when a quirky master gardener named Alan Chadwick arrived at UC Santa Cruz. Tasked with creating a student garden, Chadwick and a host of young acolytes grabbed digging fork and spade, and soon turned a rocky hillside on the upper campus into a garden overflowing with flowers and vegetables. His technique, which he called the French Intensive Biodynamic method, would come to lay the groundwork for organic gardens around the world.</p>
<p>But by 1981, Chadwick had left, and a campus farm born out of that first garden was struggling under a financial drought. Things looked bleak until an enthusiastic plant ecologist and farmer who'd just come from southern Mexico, where he'd worked the soil using traditional farming systems, arrived on campus. His name was Steve Gliessman.</p>
<p>Hired to teach a spring natural history field quarter, Gliessman was also asked to revive the struggling UC Santa Cruz Farm. His idea was to tie the Farm to academics in a science he called agroecology&#8212;the application of ecological principles to agriculture as opposed to factory farms' reliance on chemicals and what he saw as unsustainable practices.</p>
<p>Cobbling funds from philanthropist Alfred Heller and a state program that generated money from custom license plate sales, Gliessman turned the Farm into an outdoor classroom&#8212;the first formal academic agroecology program in the world and a program that would also help launch a movement that has changed the way America eats.</p>
<p>As part of the program, Gliessman and students began working with local farmer Jim Cochran in 1985 to study whether organic berry growing could be an economically viable venture.</p>
<p>The answer is evident in the organic produce grown by large-scale farms and sold in the likes of Safeways and Wal-Marts today.</p>
<p>"What we've done is call attention, on one hand, to the non-sustainability of the industrial approach to farming," said the now-retired Gliessman while sitting under the silvery branches of an olive tree he had planted years before at the campus's Sustainable Living Center. "And, on the other hand, we've developed a system of food health and justice from the soil to the people around the table."</p>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned big ideas, UC Santa Cruz is responsible for an impressive list of other groundbreaking achievements, including the following.</p>
<p><strong>The Cancer Genomics Hub,</strong> built and operated by the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, is an essential resource for scientists studying cancer genomics data with the goal of developing targeted treatments against the disease. CGHub is the largest public database of cancer genome sequences in the world and the first "NIH Trusted Partner" authorized to distribute genome sequence data to biomedical researchers.</p>
<p><strong>By mapping, at the atomic level,</strong> the structure of the ribosome, a complex molecular machine found in all cells that translates the DNA molecular machine into functioning proteins, Harry Noller, professor of molecular biology at UC Santa Cruz, and his colleagues have helped provide a basis for the development of targeted antibiotics.</p>
<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz Professor</strong> of Anthropology Adrienne Zihlman's critique of the "Man the Hunter" model changed the idea that male-dominated activities like hunting were responsible for evolutionary adaptations like big brains. Her notion that female gathering activities could just as easily account for these adaptations was responsible for a shift in evolutionary perspective that is now mainstream.</p>

In a controlled study conducted in experimental ponds, researchers found dramatic differences in pond ecosystems depending on the ratio of males to females in the mosquitofish populations. In ponds dominated by female fish, the researchers observed more pronounced ecological changes, including fewer zooplankton and a greater abundance of algae, than in male dominated ponds.</p>
<p>Mosquitofish, which are often used to control disease-spreading mosquitos, are probably the most widely introduced freshwater species in the world, according to Eric Palkovacs, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. They are also listed among the world's 100 worst invasive species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>
<p>"Mosquitofish are known to have detrimental effects on native freshwater fauna, and in a lot of places there are efforts to control and extirpate them. It's been called the 'plague minnow' in Australia and New Zealand because its effects are so drastic," Palkovacs said.</p>
<p>Palkovacs and graduate student David Fryxell are senior author and first author, respectively, of a <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1817/20151970">paper on the new findings</a> published October 21 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Trophic cascade</strong></p>
<p>In addition to eating mosquito larvae, mosquitofish prey on other insect larvae, amphibian larvae, and zooplankton such as <em>Daphnia,</em> tiny crustaceans that graze on algae in freshwater ecosystems. Female mosquitofish prefer larger food items than males, have higher feeding rates, and spend more time foraging in the presence of other females. High levels of predation can ripple through the food web in what ecologists call a "trophic cascade." When mosquitofish consume a lot of <em>Daphnia</em>, the resulting trophic cascade leads to an increase in algae.</p>
<p>"<em>Daphnia</em> are the principle grazers in freshwater ponds, keeping algal populations in check," Palkovacs explained. "We found that female-dominated mosquitofish populations cause much more dramatic trophic cascades. When there are more males, the <em>Daphnia</em> population remains higher and algal abundance is lower."</p>
<p>Other effects seen in female-dominated ponds included increased temperature and pH.</p>
<p>Palkovacs noted that many studies have looked at the evolutionary biology of sexual dimorphism (differences between the sexes in traits such as body size or coloring) and variations in sex ratios (when populations deviate from a one-to-one ratio of males to females). But little attention has been paid to the ecological consequences of these phenomena.&#160;</p>
<p>"When males and females of a species differ in traits like body size, they might use different resources or interact with the ecological community in different ways. As a result, the species can shape the ecosystem differently depending on the sex ratio of the population," Palkovacs said.</p>
<p><strong>Control strategies</strong></p>
<p>Sex ratios in natural populations of mosquitofish vary considerably from place to place around the world. Furthermore, several of the methods used or proposed for use in controlling mosquitofish populations can lead to changes in the sex ratio. For example, trapping or netting selectively removes larger fish, so would principally target females. "In this case, removing more females than males is a good thing because females have the biggest effects on the ecosystem," Palkovacs said.</p>
<p>Another strategy has been proposed that would involve genetically manipulating the fish so that females only produce male offspring. "The idea was to reduce the reproductive output of the population. Our research shows that this strategy could be doubly beneficial, leading to smaller populations in the long run while also creating more male-biased populations in the short run with less severe ecological impacts," Palkovacs said.</p>
<p>Beyond its practical implications for mosquitofish management, the study highlights an important phenomenon that may be widespread in nature. "Sexual dimorphism is very common, as is sex ratio variation. It's not just a mosquitofish phenomenon," Palkovacs said.</p>
<p>To conduct the experiment, the researchers set up an array of large stock tanks on a level field at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory. They added sediment and plankton collected from a nearby pond to establish a small freshwater ecosystem in each tank. Mosquitofish were obtained from a California mosquito vector control district, sorted by sex, and introduced into the tanks at five different sex ratios, plus a fish-free reference treatment.</p>
<p>Bird netting kept out birds and mammals that might prey on the fish, but allowed naturally occurring insects and amphibians to lay eggs in the tanks. In the experiment, amphibians laid eggs in all of the treatments, but larval amphibians (tadpoles) were only found in tanks without mosquitofish.</p>
<p>The detrimental effects of mosquitofish on native biodiversity have been widely studied. Sex ratios may play an important role in this, although additional studies in natural settings will be needed to see what the effects of sex ratio variation are in the wild, "in the midst of all the other natural variation," Palkovacs said.</p>

<p>When a star comes too close to a black hole, the intense gravity of the black hole results in tidal forces that can rip the star apart. In these events, called "tidal disruptions," some of the stellar debris is flung outward at high speeds, while the rest falls toward the black hole. This causes a bright flare of radiation that can last for a few years.</p>
<p>NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, Swift Gamma-ray Burst Explorer, and ESA's XMM-Newton collected different pieces of this astronomical puzzle in a tidal disruption event called ASASSN-14li, originally discovered in an optical search by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) in November 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Theory confirmed</strong></p>
<p>This is the first tidal disruption event from which astronomers have been able to observe radiation emitted at both x-ray and optical wavelengths, according to Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. The observations confirm a theoretical model of tidal disruptions developed by Ramirez-Ruiz and James Guillochon, a former UCSC graduate student now at Harvard University. They are both coauthors of a paper on the new findings published October 22 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>According to their model, x-rays are emitted from near the "event horizon" where stellar debris is falling into the black hole. The optical flare is the result of x-rays being absorbed and re-emitted at longer wavelengths by material that was flung outward from the black hole. In past observations of tidal disruptions, astronomers have only been able to see this re-emitted light.</p>
<p>"The black hole is behind a cloak of debris that changes its appearance, but now we are able to see the inner beast," Ramirez-Ruiz said. "James and I had predicted that we should be able to see both x-ray and optical emissions."</p>
<p>The event occurred near a supermassive black hole estimated to weigh a few million times the mass of the sun. The black hole is located in the center of PGC 043234, a galaxy that lies about 290 million light years from Earth, making it the closest tidal disruption event discovered in a decade.</p>
<p>"We have seen evidence for a handful of tidal disruptions over the years and have developed a lot of ideas of what goes on," said Jon Miller of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who led the study. "This one is the best chance we have had so far to really understand what happens when a black hole shreds a star."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Surge of x-rays</strong></p>
<p>After the star is destroyed, the black hole's strong gravitational forces pull most of the remains of the star toward it. This infalling debris is heated to millions of degrees and generates a huge amount of x-ray light. Soon after this surge of x-rays, the amount of light decreases as the material falls beyond the black hole's event horizon, the point beyond which no light can escape.</p>
<p>Gas often falls toward black holes by spiraling inward in a disk. But how this process starts has remained a mystery. In ASASSN-14li, astronomers were able to witness the formation of such a disk by looking at the x-ray light at different wavelengths (known as the "x-ray spectrum") and tracking how that changed over time. The researchers determined that the x-rays being produced come from material that is either very close to or is actually in the smallest possible stable orbit around the black hole.</p>
<p>"This proves that the accretion disk is the energy source for the x-ray emissions," Ramirez-Ruiz said. "But it is not a naked disk. It's cloaked by a lot of material that gets ejected during disk formation, and this ejected material leaves imprints in the x-ray emissions."</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz and Guillochon plan to publish a more detailed theoretical analysis of the observations in a forthcoming paper. Astronomers also hope to find more events like ASASSN-14li, which they can use to continue to test theoretical models about how black holes affect their environments and anything that might wander too close.</p>

Max’ premieres on the Al Jazeera America television channel Oct. 25</article-subhead><article-text><p>&#8220;<em>Daisy and Max</em> is not the film I had planned to make,&#8221; says UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of film and digital media Jennifer Maytorena Taylor.<br/>
<br/>
 Taylor had originally chosen Max, a former gang member, and Daisy, a victim of gang violence, to be model characters for a new documentary film about a successful violence intervention program.<br/>
<br/>
 As a teenager, Daisy had watched her older sister bleed to death in the driveway of her family&#8217;s house after being shot by a gang member. She had gone on to become a social worker, now studying for a doctorate in counseling,<br/>
<br/>
 Max was in and out of prison before he turned his life around working for the City of Los Angeles&#8217;s pioneering gang intervention program.<br/>
<br/>
 They had a new baby named Sarah, but agreed to be filmed over the summer to document how the couple balanced their lives while working in an often dangerous and emotionally demanding field.<br/>
<br/>
 But four days before they were set to begin filming, things changed.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Daisy texted me that our project was off,&#8221; says Taylor. &#8220;The FBI had just raided their house in the middle of the night, broken their door in, arrested Max on three-year-old minor drug charges&#8212;and then called the county social workers to take Sarah (their new baby) into what they called &#8216;protective custody&#8217;.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Max suddenly disappeared into the federal prison system, and Daisy was left to fight to save her family.<br/>
<br/>
 Despite the extraordinary turn of events, they did begin filming a few days later after all.<br/>
<br/>
 The result is an hour-long documentary, filmed on location in South Los Angeles. Descibed by the <em>Village Voice</em> as &#8220;urgent and illuminating, humane and infuriating,&#8221; it features the voice of acclaimed Chicano actor Jesse Borrego (<em>Mi Vida Locas, La Mission, American Crime</em>) reading from Max&#8217;s letters.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Daisy &amp; Max will screen at the Carmel International Film Festival</strong>, which runs October 21-25, and will also debut on the Al Jazeera America television channel on Sunday, Oct. 25.<br/>
<br/>
 The film is also set to screen at a number of other upcoming festivals, including the ALBA Human Rights Film Festival in New York City, and the Saint Louis International Film Festival.<br/>
<br/>
 Taylor joined the Film and Digital Media Department at UC Santa Cruz in 2014. She is an award-winning documentary producer and director of character-based, documentary films--often focusing on youth, Latinos, and life in communities affected by poverty, surveillance, the correctional system, and state-sponsored violence.<br/>
<br/>
 Her credits include the award-winning films <em>New Muslim Cool, Special Circumstances, Paulina, Home Front, Immigration Calculations; Ramadan Primetim</em>e; and the <em>Street Knowledge 2 College</em> series for PBS, Latino Public Broadcasting and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting&#8217;s American Graduate Initiative.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>The two-year Scialog initiative brings together early career scientists in astronomy, astrophysics, and computational science to pursue collaborative research in "time domain astrophysics," which refers to the study of astronomical events that change over relatively short timescales, such as exploding stars, gamma-ray bursts, and active galactic nuclei. The advent of automated telescopes and surveys that cover most of the sky has led to new opportunities to study and understand these events.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has been at the forefront of research in this area. Ramirez-Ruiz noted that the Scialog Fellows for Time Domain Astrophysics include former UC Santa Cruz graduate students Andrew MacFadyen (now at New York University) and Laura Lopez (now at Ohio State University), as well as former UCSC postdoctoral researchers Daniel Kasen (now at UC Berkeley), Kevin Moore (now at Claremont McKenna College), and Mike Zingale (now at SUNY Stony Brook).</p>
<p>"UCSC is clearly seen as a pivotal incubator of talent in this emerging field," Ramirez-Ruiz said. "Transient objects have always played a crucial role in the development of astronomy and in the use of astronomical observations to illuminate new physics. In the next few years, the largest growth area is in surveys of the transient sky."</p>
<p>He explained that, in terms of the volume of the universe in which the surveys are sensitive for the detection of transient phenomena, current surveys have effective volumes more than ten times larger than previous observational efforts. Future surveys, such as the <a href="http://www.lsst.org/">Large Synoptic Survey Telescope</a> (LSST), are expected to be at least 100 times larger than current ones.</p>
<p>"We are confident that the new surveys will yield a wide variety of new transients and supernovae, in part because smaller volume surveys have recently yielded a handful of very unusual events," said Ramirez-Ruiz, who has studied and interpreted many of these observations.</p>
<p>Two Scialog conferences, in fall 2015 and 2016, are planned for the Time Domain Astrophysics initiative. The conferences will be attended by the early career Scialog Fellows and 10 distinguished senior scientists, with the goal of identifying bottlenecks, finding avenues for breakthroughs, and building new scientific teams to pursue these ideas with funding from RCSA.</p>
<p>RCSA's Scialog program supports research, intensive dialog, and community building to address scientific challenges of global significance. Within each multi-year initiative, Scialog Fellows collaborate in high-risk discovery research on untested ideas and communicate their progress in annual closed conferences. RCSA is a private foundation that supports basic research in the physical sciences at U.S. colleges and universities.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9179c07c807270176d1201785e4630b7"><name>news-article</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Physicist Joel Primack honored by American Physical Society</title><summary>Primack will receive the 2016 Leo Szilard Lectureship Award from the APS.</summary><keywords>Joel Primack, APS</keywords><start-date>1445497200000</start-date><display-name>Physicist Joel Primack honored by American Physical Society</display-name><path>/2015/10/news-article</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/news-article</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1445549686878</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1445549936084</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/joelprimack-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/joelprimack-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>joelprimack-250.jpg</name><display-name>joelprimack-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>48013</file-size><width>250</width><height>306</height></image><image-alt>Joel Primack</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/joelprimack-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/joelprimack-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>joelprimack-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>joelprimack-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17734</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Joel Primack</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Joel Primack</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Leading physicist recognized for promoting the use of physics for the benefit of society</article-subhead><article-text><p>The American Physical Society (APS) has announced that Joel Primack, distinguished professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, will receive the 2016 <a href="http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/awards/szilard.cfm">Leo Szilard Lectureship Award</a>.</p>
<p>The award recognizes Primack "for a crucial role in establishing the Congressional Science and Technology Policy Fellowships." The Leo Szilard Lectureship Award recognizes outstanding accomplishments by physicists in promoting the use of physics for the benefit of society in such areas as the environment, arms control, and science policy. The honoree's lecture at an APS meeting is intended to increase the visibility of those who have promoted the use of physics for the benefit of society.</p>
<p>A leader in particle astrophysics and cosmology, Primack helped create the now-standard Cold Dark Matter theory of galaxy and cosmic large-scale structure formation. In 1988, he became an APS Fellow "for pioneering contributions to gauge theory and cosmology," and in 1999 he received a Humboldt Research Award. He and his wife, Nancy Ellen Abrams, have written two popular books on modern cosmology and its relevance to the world.</p>
<p>Primack has also long been a leader in science and technology policy. He co-authored with Frank von Hippel the book <em>Advice and Dissent: Scientists in the Political Arena</em> (1974), and he worked with von Hippel and Senator Ted Kennedy to create the NSF Science for Citizens program. He helped initiate the APS program of studies on public policy issues in 1974 and co-authored with Freeman Dyson the proposal for the APS Nuclear Reactor Study. Primack helped organize the APS Forum on Physics and Society, and he shared the 1977 Forum on Physics and Society Award with von Hippel. He chaired the Forum in 2005.</p>
<p>In 1988, Primack led the Federation of American Scientists program on space nuclear reactor arms control and helped stop the launching of Soviet reactor-powered satellites. In 2004, as a member of the APS Panel on Public Affairs, he organized and chaired the committee that wrote a critical APS report on President Bush's Vision for Space Exploration.</p>
<p>Primack also started the program on Science and Human Rights at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). In 1995, he was made a Fellow of the AAAS "for pioneering efforts in the establishment of the AAAS Congressional Science Fellows Program and for dedication to expanding the use of science in policymaking throughout government." He chaired the AAAS Committee on Science, Ethics, and Religion from 2000 to 2002.</p>
<p>Primack earned a bachelor's degree in physics at Princeton University and Ph.D. in physics at Stanford University. He joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1973.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="917f5db4807270176d120178a6475f42"><name>car-sharing-opportunities</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Carsharing opportunities</title><summary>UCSC subscribes to Zimride, a campus-specific ride-matching service and the cost of the service is free to all UCSC students, staff, and faculty.</summary><start-date>1445497200000</start-date><display-name>Carsharing opportunities</display-name><path>/2015/10/car-sharing-opportunities</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/car-sharing-opportunities</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1445550054803</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1445550054803</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>UCSC subscribes to&#160;<span>Zimride</span>, a campus-specific&#160;<span>ride</span>-matching service.&#160;<span>Zimride</span>&#160;helps you offer or request rides for regular commutes or one-time road trips (such as getting to local airports, or getting home for Thanksgiving).

Global Food Initiative (GFI) fellowships for the 2015&#8211;2016 academic year. They will be involved in one of the ongoing GFI projects at UCSC, which include efforts to address food equity and improve food security for students on UC campuses, and to increase opportunities for experiential learning at the campus&#8217;s farm and gardens</p>
<p>Graduate students Hamutahl Cohen and Katherine Ennis, and undergraduates David Robles and Judy Xie are among the 44 GFI fellows from throughout the UC system who are advancing work to increase food system sustainability and improve food access and nutrition at the state, national, and international levels.</p>
<p>A public workshop to meet UCSC&#8217;s new fellowship recipients and learn more about GFI initiatives at UCSC is being planned for later in fall quarter. Check the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) website, casfs.ucsc.edu, for additional information. Moe information about UCSC&#8217;s Global Food Initiative work is at casfs.ucsc.edu/research/gfi.html.</p>
<p>The four new UCSC GFI fellowship recipients are:</p>
<p><strong>Hamutahl Cohen</strong>, a Ph.D. candidate in environmental studies. Her research on the landscape epidemiology of pathogens in domesticated and wild bees sits at the&#160;intersection of urban agroecology, pollinator conservation, and California food systems.</p>
<p>This research draws from Cohen&#8217;s first-hand experiences as an undergraduate working with the Student Organic Garden Association (SOGA) at UC Berkeley and as an apprentice and then graduate student at UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS). Having benefited from experiences in urban and school gardens at the University of California, Cohen is excited to serve as GFI Fellow to promote experiential learning in campus farms and gardens, as well as enhance food access through UC food security initiatives.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Katherine Ennis,</strong> a Ph.D. Candidate in environmental studies studying the effects of climate change on insect communities and ecosystem services in agriculture, with much of her research focused on shaded coffee systems in Central America. As a master's student at the University of Michigan, Ennis worked as a student leader for Cultivating Community's campus and community gardens, where she led garden workshops and activities for students and community members.</p>
<p>Since beginning her Ph.D. at Santa Cruz she has worked with several CASFS staff to design, organize, and lead field-based learning activities at the UCSC Farm for underrepresented high school and college students in California's central coast region. As part of the GFI, Katherine plans to continue working on projects to improve agroecology experiential learning programs and promote food security for UC students and all Californians.</p>
<p><strong>David Robles</strong> is an undergraduate studying plant sciences and history. Robles's inspiration for working and studying ways to improve food systems began with his employment at CASFS. Serving three years as an assistant Farm and Garden manager has exposed him to nearly every aspect of the food system in preparation for what he hopes will be a career in social justice centered around agriculture. As a GFI Fellow David hopes to use his experiences and holistic approach to education as tools for inspiring interest and creating demand for experiential learning opportunities within the UC system.</p>
<p><strong>Judy Xie</strong> is an undergraduate student majoring in environmental studies and biology. Her growing interest in and passion about environmental-related issues began in fourth grade when she decided to write a story about a peanut saving the forest for a short story assignment.</p>
<p>From then on, she has been involved with clubs and organizations that worked together to bring awareness about environmental issues and doing hands on work to improve city and state parks. Looking to explore other fields, Xie got involved with food through the Real Food Calculator team that works on food procurement and research analysis of UCSC Dining and has enjoyed learning about the food systems. With the GFI fellowship, she is looking forward to learning from her GFI peers and being involved with food equity and food access projects.</p>
<p>In addition to their on-campus work, UCSC&#8217;s GFI Fellows will join other fellowship recipients from across the UC system for a series of activities, including an orientation, leadership training, spring field trip and joint summer symposium with Carbon Neutrality Initiative fellows.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="96e1b296807270176d1201784b1f3e33"><name>climate-action-champion</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Physicist Sue Carter named Faculty Climate Action Champion for 2015-16</title><summary>Carter plans to establish a campus sustainability lab to support student-led research and training.</summary><keywords>Sue Carter, Climate Action Champion, Sustainability Lab, S-lab, carbon neutrality</keywords><start-date>1445878800000</start-date><display-name>Physicist Sue Carter named Faculty Climate Action Champion for 2015-16</display-name><path>/2015/10/climate-action-champion</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/climate-action-champion</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1445640385129</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1445876037925</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/sue-carter-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/sue-carter-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sue-carter-350.jpg</name><display-name>sue-carter-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>74367</file-size><width>350</width><height>386</height></image><image-alt>Sue Carter</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/10/images/carter-sue-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/10/images/carter-sue-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>carter-sue-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>carter-sue-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18558</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sue Carter</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Sue Carter (Photo by C. Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As the first recipient of the Faculty Climate Action Champion Award, physics professor Sue Carter will establish a campus sustainability lab to support student-led research and training. Carter, who was chosen for the award by the Sustainability Office and the Academic Senate's Committee on Research, submitted a proposal that includes a strong plan for student and community engagement.</p>
<p>The sustainability lab will promote carbon emissions reductions and sustainable use of natural resources, providing students with indoor and outdoor laboratory space, educational tools, and resources.</p>
<p>"We'll set up both indoor and outdoor spaces with the facilities, equipment, and mentorship for students to pursue their great ideas about how to make the world more sustainable," Carter said. "There is a big demand among students for more opportunities for experiential learning and hands-on experience, particularly working with the built environment and finding solutions to the problems of sustainability and climate change."</p>
<p>Carter is among the UC experts joining Gov. Jerry Brown, UC President Janet Napolitano, and others at the <a href="http://uc-carbonneutralitysummit2015.ucsd.edu/index.html">UC Summit on Carbon and Climate Neutrality</a>, October 26 to 27 at UC San Diego.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation and leadership</strong></p>
<p>The Faculty Climate Action Champion Award promotes faculty innovation and leadership in climate change research, teaching, and engagement. The award was developed through the Office of the President's <a href="http://ucop.edu/sustainability/programs-initiatives/global-climate-council/index.html">Global Climate Leadership Council</a> to support UC's <a href="http://ucop.edu/initiatives/carbon-neutrality-initiative.html">Carbon Neutrality Initiative</a>, which commits UC to emitting net zero greenhouse gases from its buildings and vehicle fleet by 2025, something no other major university system has done.</p>
<p>The Climate Action Champion Award provides $25,000 and institutional support for Carter's efforts to deepen climate change teaching and research on campus. According to Carter, the involvement of students is essential to meeting the campus's sustainability and carbon neutrality goals.</p>
<p>"If we can mobilize our students to start working toward solutions, they can be a source of innovative ideas for how to meet those goals," Carter said.</p>
<p>She plans to use the Climate Action Champion Award to develop a sustainability curriculum, online course materials and training modules, and a web site where students and faculty can find resources.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Community engagement</strong></p>
<p>Plans for community engagement include public events and a K-12 Climate Action Summer Camp at the sustainability lab in summer 2016. Carter also plans to develop a curriculum and mentorship network for entrepreneurship focused on sustainability and climate action. An entrepreneur herself, she has launched several start-up companies, including two based on her research in solar energy technologies. Carter also directs the UCSC Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development (CIED) and plans to incorporate sustainability into CIED programs. For example, she will include a sustainability module in a summer entrepreneurship academy to train students about entrepreneurial skills and resources that are specific to sustainable innovations.</p>
<p>For the mentoring network, Carter plans to involve entrepreneurs from Santa Cruz and Silicon Valley who have been successful in launching "green" enterprises and who will serve as mentors for the student teams.</p>
<p>"We hope that at least some of the ideas developed in the sustainability lab will get spun out into innovations that can be licensed or incorporated into existing companies or startups," Carter said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

<p>But the yellow mollusk was anything but reclusive Sunday when the City of Santa Cruz marked UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary with a &#8220;first-on-the-planet&#8221; Banana Slug Parade right through the heart of downtown.</p>
<p>With more than 40 entries &#8212; from a startlingly yellow Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District bus to the enchanting Anak Swarasanti gamelan troupe and UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s all-female a capella group, The High Tones, belting out Queen&#8217;s &#8220;Fat Bottomed Girls&#8221; &#8212; the parade was a whimsical and entertaining celebration of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s five-decades-long residence in the county.</p>
<p>"The university is a major contributor to our community,&#8221; said Santa Cruz Mayor Don Lane, who began planning for the event more than a year earlier. He noted the 4,000 jobs the university provides, the millions of dollars pumped into the local economy, the thousands of service hours donated by student volunteers, and the vibrant arts scene fed by a creative campus.</p>
<p>The parade and student expo that followed, he said, was a way to honor that contribution and also serve as a &#8220;bridge-building&#8221; event between campus and town.</p>
<p>For the crowd that lined the streets and sipped their morning brews on coffee shop patios, the parade was 30 minutes of DIY fun.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz fire engines tooted sirens while motorcycle riders from UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity revved their engines and the campus cheer team barked out snappy chants.</p>
<p>Jody Ryker, a UC Santa Cruz graduate student in pure mathematics, performed Cirque du Soleil-like moves on a hoop suspended from a moving truck as part of Aerial Arts Santa Cruz while 11 members (five of them campus alum) of the Santa Cruz Public Library&#8217;s Precision Book Truck Drill Team turned librarian chores into art.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Long Marine Lab got literal, trailering a decorated 22-foot Anderson research boat along the parade route &#8212; a float that actually floated, noted UC Santa Cruz Earth Sciences Professor Gary Griggs. Not only did the entry win Best in Show but the group was so enthusiastic, it circled the parade route twice.</p>
<p>Campus athletic teams from women&#8217;s basketball to the sailing squad and a triathlon group marched along with members of the campus Alumni Association who brought a crowd-pleasing 12-foot Sammy the Slug balloon sculpture and carried a banner that marked the 100,000 alumni the campus has turned out.</p>
<p>Aspiring alumna, 10-year-old Xochitl Leyva of Aptos, rode her slug-yellow unicycle along the parade route.&#160; Her uncle Jesse Velez, the son of immigrant field workers, graduated from UC Santa Cruz in the early '90s and now heads up the IT Department for the City of Clovis. He was the first in his family to graduate from college.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go to UCSC because my <em>tio</em> went there and he was a Banana Slug,&#8221; said the fifth-grader at Lincoln Elementary School in Salinas. &#8220;I want to live up to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Appearing just ahead of the enthusiastic young unicyclist, University Council-American Federation of Teachers pedaled tree-scraping puppet heads along the route while singing lyric-bending pop songs to mark contract negotiations for UCSC lecturers.</p>
<p>After the celebratory procession, UC Santa Cruz showed off its research side with a Banana Slug Expo on Cooper Street.</p>
<p>Mini robots spun and turned to the delight of youngsters as UC Santa Cruz computer engineering grad student Max Lichtenstein touted &#8220;Slug Wars: The Slime Awakens,&#8221; a December campus tournament featuring student-created robots.</p>
<p>Across the way, Xochitl Clare (Kresge &#8217;16, marine biology and theater) described her research into what elephant seals eat and whether the energy cost of diving into the depths was worth the nutrition the pinnipeds got by eating the fish there. Nearby, Taylor Gotfrid (Crown &#8217;17, computer engineering and cognitive science) explained her work creating computer games that makes speech therapy fun for kids who had cleft palate surgery.</p>
<p>For Donna Mekis, president of the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association, the parade marked a positive change in town/gown relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a first,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and it&#8217;s wonderful.&#8221;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a5aaddf1807270176d120178a75e929a"><name>sexual-harassment-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC sexual violence and sexual harassment policy and resources</title><summary>The University of California, Santa Cruz is committed to creating and maintaining an environment in which all persons who live, work, and learn in our campus community can be free of sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and retaliation.</summary><start-date>1445583600000</start-date><display-name>UC Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy and Resources</display-name><path>/2015/10/sexual-harassment-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/sexual-harassment-policy</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1445888449959</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1446580301993</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz is committed to creating and maintaining an environment in which all persons who live, work, and learn in our campus community can be free of sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and retaliation.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000385/SHSV">interim UC policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment (PDF)</a> prohibits sex offenses and provides information for faculty, staff, and students about how to respond when they experience a sex offense or hear about a sex offense experienced by another member of our community.</p>
<p>We all must take responsibility to engage as active bystanders to prevent sex offenses in our community and to report sex offenses to the <a href="http://safe.ucsc.edu/get-help/">Title IX office</a> when they occur. Reporting ensures that survivors will be provided information regarding their rights and options, and given all of the assistance and support resources available. A new <a href="http://safe.ucsc.edu">sexual assault and awareness website</a> has been created to provide the campus community with information about how the university works to prevent sexual violence, how the university will respond once it becomes aware of sexual violence, and the many resources available to those who have been affected by sexual violence. Sexual violence includes gender-based violence and discrimination based on gender identity, gender expression, or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity.</p>
<p>Reports of sexual violence should be made as soon as possible to the Title IX Office; it should be noted that supervisors and faculty are required by the policy to report sex offenses to the Title IX Office. Additionally, the <a href="http://police.ucsc.edu">UC Santa Cruz Police Department</a> is available to assist with emergency situations and criminal complaints.</p>
<p>The newly created <a href="http://care.ucsc.edu">Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education</a> (CARE) Office in Kresge 714 is available to provide free, confidential assistance and information to survivors of sexual assault, stalking, and dating/domestic violence. CARE advocates can help you understand all of the reporting options so that you are able to make informed decisions. CARE staff can also provide assistance with requesting academic, housing, transportation, and employment accommodations for survivors. Confidential CARE advocates are available for appointments from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday by calling 831-502-CARE (2273). <a href="http://care.ucsc.edu/resources/advocacy-appointment-request.html">Appointments can also be made online</a>.</p>
<p>If you need to speak with an advocate immediately outside of business hours, please call <a href="http://www.monarchscc.org">Monarch Services</a> at 1-888-900-4232.</p>
<p>If you have further questions and concerns regarding the policies or your responsibility to report, please contact the Title IX Officer, Tracey Tsugawa, at 831-459-2462 or if you are in need of confidential advocate support, please contact CARE Coordinator, Emily Crutcher, at 831-502-2273.</p>
<p>Please join me in doing your part to end sexual violence in our community.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a5b27374807270176d1201788c93c7b9"><name>shr-recruitment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Invitation to Open Forums for AVC Staff Human Resources Candidates</title><summary>Four finalists for the position of AVC SHR will be visiting the UCSC campus during the first two weeks of November 2015.

<h2>Maximizing Achievement through Preparedness and Advising</h2>
<p>Under the grant, UC Santa Cruz will redesign Math 2. Historically, this course has been taken by many students of color, women and students from a low-income background, many of whom repeat it or do not continue in math based majors after failing this class. The redesigned course will take an active learning approach, rather than being lecture-based. Additionally, it will allow the campus to reduce the size of the class sections from 35 to 25 students, as well as have them meet twice a week instead of once with a goal of creating a learning community. An EOP intervention counselor will also be available to monitor and support students with non-academic barriers in their transition to the university. &#160;Expert math lecturer Nandini Bhattacharya will lead the development of the course redesign.</p>
<p>For writing, which can be another academic hurdle for many students, the campus will develop two new ways to help hone their composition skills.</p>
<p>First, UC Santa Cruz will offer "Reading for Writing in College Institute," a 10-day summer seminar designed by Sarah Hope-Parmeter and her faculty colleagues from the Writing Program that focuses on the skills needed to better prepare incoming freshmen for college-level reading and writing, and success in their transition. The seminars will be held in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Central Valley, where students have low scores on the UC Analytical Writing Placement Exam.</p>
<p>The second component will have undergraduate tutors using video conferencing to lead reading groups for three additional weeks at the end of summer of reading and writing practice as a ramp-up to writing in college.</p>
<p>To increase the sense of belonging amongst Latino and low-income students, the grant will support events throughout the state to help ease the college transition for students and their families. Plans include holding multilingual regional conferences for admitted students to help families develop plans for college, transition to college, and workshops on financial education and how to navigate the matriculation process. Additionally, the campus will use social events to welcome incoming students and expand the El Centro Internship Program to broaden opportunities to explore Latino identity in college.</p>
<p>On the advising front, the campus will deepen existing academic coaching during critical points &#8212; when students are having a difficult time in class and when they're less than a quarter away from completing the degree and when they are in academic difficulty through EOP&#8217;s Crossing the Finish Line and iMAP (Improving My Academic Progress).</p>
</div>
<p>Two grants from the U.S. Department of Education will help UC Santa Cruz increase achievement for Latinos and all students on campus, as well as partner with San Jose City College to help transfer students earn their bachelor's degrees at a research university.</p>
<p>Totaling $3.6 million, the awards from the Title V Developing Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) Program are the result of a campuswide effort to look at how UC Santa Cruz can best serve Latino and other students who have a difficult time when they start college.</p>
<p>"At its core, UC Santa Cruz is committed to enabling all of its students to succeed," Chancellor George Blumenthal said. "These two grants will help us to focus and further meet the needs of a community that is critical to the state's economic future, and moreover will help bring diversity to the campus and to our workforce."</p>
<p>Enrollment of Latino undergraduate students at UC Santa Cruz hit 28 percent in 2012, crossing the 25 percent threshold to be considered a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities. Achieving this status allowed the campus to apply for federal HSI grants, accomplishing one of the 5 for 2015 goals set by Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway. This is the first time UC Santa Cruz has received institutional funding from the federal government because of this distinction.</p>
<p>Pablo Reguerin, executive director for Retention Services and Educational Opportunity Programs, and Professor Juan Poblete with the Literature Department co-chair the task-force that worked on one of the two HSI grants the campus just received.</p>
<p>"These HSI grants will not only help us level the field for Latinos and other underrepresented students at the very start of their UC Santa Cruz career, but - given the combined impact of a 30 percent demographic presence and their lower overall graduation and retention rates - will also, if successful, allow the campus to significantly increase its chances of achieving its long-term strategic goals," said Reguerin and Poblete. "Latino success is now absolutely key to UC Santa Cruz's success."</p>
<p>The two HSI grants are an instrument of a larger campus vision for educational equity and student success, Reguerin and Poblete explained.</p>
<p>"This can help move us beyond compositional diversity to better cultivating the talents of all our students," they said. "With this grant we have an opportunity to innovate, experiment, and reform UC Santa Cruz and build institutional capacity to better serve all students.</p>
<p>"For UC Santa Cruz, the challenge is how to fulfill its public education mission and help California be a more just and productive society when more than 63 percent of its students are what is still, but inadequately, called minorities, and often from working class backgrounds with low cultural and social capitals," Reguerin and Poblete said.</p>
<p>"When underprivileged minorities become most of the students the institution must educate, present and future success in achieving its goals depend crucially on its capacity to adapt and respond to that change. UC Santa Cruz is well on its way to do just that and these two grants will help us see one path to get there."</p>
<p>The first grant, $2.6 million spread over five years, is for the Maximizing Achievement through Preparedness and Advising (MAPA). It focuses on four areas that the HSI team found to restrict achievement early on for underrepresented students: college algebra for calculus (Math 2), writing, sense of belonging, and advising.</p>
<p>Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education Richard Hughey established the HSI Team in 2012 to consider the true meaning of becoming HSI, how to best serve UC Santa Cruz students, and to prepare for funding opportunities.</p>
<p>"For the past three years, the team has worked to tackle the four most key issues entering student success with thought and innovation," Hughey said. "The hard work of the entire team coupled with this Department of Education funding will have a transformative effect on our campus that will touch all students."</p>
<p>San Jose City College and UC Santa Cruz collaborated to receive a $3.2 million grant for the Cultivamos Excelencia Project, which over five years seeks to motivate and retain Hispanic and other high-need students to complete a degree at a research university.</p>
<p>The two campuses will work together using a combination of tutoring, mentoring, research skills instruction, transfer advising and participation in undergraduate research to encourage self-efficacy, skill development and motivation to complete their bachelor degrees on-time with a strong set of analytical and writing skills.</p>
<p>"Moving forward, our work together will not only promote educational opportunity, but it will also strengthen the transfer pipeline for San Jose City College students to UC Santa Cruz," San Jose City College President Byron D. Clift Breland said. "We are pleased to partner with our colleagues at UC Santa Cruz to launch this valued and historic initiative for the students and the communities we are charged to serve."</p>
<p>The project will give students a chance to take courses on research methods for transfer credit, as well as participate in research projects for university credit while they're still enrolled at the city college. The two offerings strive to help students realize they can succeed at a research university.</p>
<p>One of the objectives is to increase the percentage of two-year college Hispanic students transferring from 33 percent to 43 percent by the end of the grant period, as well as decrease the time-to-graduate by a year for students in the program.</p>
<p>San Jose City College (SJCC), established in 1921, enrolls more than 10,000 students each semester. The city college met the U.S. Department of Education standard to become a HSI in 2000. Latino enrollment at SJCC is now more than 40 percent. In 2008, federal HSI funds for SJCC lead to the development of the Metas Program, which has since evolved into a campus model for improving the way in which SJCC serves Latino students.</p>
<p>Robert Gutierrez, director of the Metas Program, is responsible for multiple academic programs integrating instructional and student support services. The new project, Cultivamos Excelencia, will spur the development of an undergraduate research program housed in the Metas Program. Gutierrez attended SJCC and transferred to UC Santa Cruz, where he earned a bachelor's degree in literature.</p>
<p>"It's full circle for me to have the opportunity to serve students at two institutions where I accomplished more than I could have possibly imagined despite tremendous odds as a son of immigrant parents from El Salvador and Mexico," Gutierrez said. "I'm the first in the family to go to college, so I have an inherent will to serve underrepresented students."</p>

<p>But UC Santa Cruz politics professor Ronnie Lipschutz has organized a conference to think more optimistically about the future and replace popular interest in dystopia with more encouraging utopian visions, both past and present.</p>
<p><a href="http://clrc.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/news-article-utopian-dreaming.html">"Utopian Dreaming: 50 Years of Imagined Futures in California and at UCSC"</a> will celebrate the 40-year anniversary of "Ecotopia," Ernest Callenbach's seminal novel that imagined Northern California, Oregon, and Washington breaking off from the rest of the country and forming an ecological, one-with-nature, new nation.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of UC Santa Cruz, the conference on November 6 and 7 will offer a gamut of futurists sharing new visions and old, on the campus, California, and the world.&#160;The conference is free, but registration is requested and available <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/utopian-dreaming-50-years-of-imagined-futures-in-california-and-at-uc-santa-cruz-tickets-17483741341">online</a>.</p>
<p>"I've been teaching international politics for a long time, and it's always a depressing topic," said Lipschutz, who is the provost of College Eight. "There's been a dearth of utopian thinking in recent years. At the end of the day, I think the environmental threats we face demand utopian thinking. Maybe we can get people to think more positively about the future."</p>
<p>Science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson, who has won the highest honors in his genre, the Hugo and Nebula awards, will deliver the keynote address with a hope-and-change attitude about the future and the state of fiction predicting it.</p>
<p>"Science fiction is really sensitive to the mood of the time," Robinson said. "People are fearful now. But in the '70s when Ecotopia was written, there was a lot of bad stuff going on and a feeling that anything could happen, including good things.</p>
<p>"It's been 35 years since the Reagan and Thatcher conservative regimes and the effect has been bad environmentally and socially. But I think there are good things too."</p>
<p>Grim dystopian visions make for more dramatic movies, he said, and utopian ones are more low-key.</p>
<p>"There's always going to be hope," he said. "It's always stubborn and persistent, even if it's more subtle."</p>
<p>Robinson, who has published 19 novels and dozens of short stories, was hailed as a "Hero of the Environment" by Time magazine in 2008 for the optimistic environmentalism in his work.</p>
<p>He sees global warming as a "pressurizer" forcing countries to deal with an emergency, but he's encouraged that "three-fourths" of the population believes in it and can push back against "politicians bought by lobbyists from the carbon industry."</p>
<p>And, he's enthused about the upcoming Paris conference on climate change, at which a hundred thousand people are expected to march in the streets.</p>

 &#8212;&#160;</em> UC President Janet Napolitano, June 10, 2015</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<hr/>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is strongly committed to building and maintaining a campus environment that supports and values all members of our community including visitors. Our campus is currently in the process of implementing new <em>University of California Guidelines for Providing Gender Inclusive Facilities</em> issued by President Napolitano and effective as of July 1, 2015.</p>
<p>The guidelines were the result of recommendations made to President Napolitano by the UC Task Force and Implementation Team on LGBT Culture and Inclusion. Our own Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee, who also serves as the Campus Diversity Officer-Faculty, was a member of the task force.</p>
<p>In accordance with the university&#8217;s nondiscrimination policies, these guidelines &#8220;seek to create an inclusive campus environment for transgender and gender variant people.&#8220; The guidelines affirm that individuals have the rights to use facilities that correspond with their gender identity and focus on providing a safe environment, consistent with our Principles of Community and other efforts that promote civility and respect. Gender inclusion should provide access and equality by creating and maintaining an environment that is accessible, safe, and respectful of all individuals.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz began converting single occupancy restrooms into gender inclusive facilities on the main campus long before the new UC guidelines were issued as a result of effective advocacy efforts and forward thinking on the part of students, and supportive staff and faculty.</p>
<p>This is just a beginning and only part of our continuing efforts to create and maintain an inclusive campus environment. Other important efforts include the addition of a new Transgender Educator who will soon join the staff at the Cant&#250; Center.</p>
<p>The guidelines apply to UC-owned facilities including new construction and renovation projects for existing facilities. &#160;The following is required in the first year of implementation: establishing a process for implementing the guidelines; completing an audit of all UC owned buildings noting existing gender inclusive facilities in each building; conversion of existing single occupancy restrooms, showers and changing rooms in UC owned buildings to gender inclusive facilities; posting directional signage to the nearest gender inclusive facility where appropriate; establishing waiver and complaint processes; developing appropriate signage for gender inclusive facilities and posting the locations of gender inclusive facilities on the campus website. In addition, new building construction and major renovations beginning design on or after July 1, 2015 should include gender inclusive facilities where not already present.</p>
<p>During the summer, we appointed a Gender Inclusive Facilities Guidelines Implementation Workgroup to oversee first year implementation of the guidelines and make recommendations for institutionalizing provisions of the guidelines going forward. &#160;Workgroup members recognize that existing gender inclusive facility signage may not reflect current best practices and the workgroup will be soliciting input from and involving interested campus constituencies in selecting the design of new permanent signage. In addition to ensuring each location meets the technical requirements of the guidelines, President Napolitano encouraged continued consultation with campus LGBT councils, committees, and centers and the workgroup is strongly committed to doing so.</p>
<p>For more information, please contact co-coordinators of the workgroup: Jean Marie Scott (<a href="mailto:jmscott@ucsc.edu">jmscott@ucsc.edu</a>) or Ciel Benedetto (<a href="mailto:cbene@ucsc.edu">cbene@ucsc.edu</a>).</p>

That&#8217;s the party line on mass incarceration heard from social critics for years, but now it&#8217;s coming from a new chorus: police chiefs by the score.&#8221;</em>&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>--<em><strong>San Francisco Chronicle</strong>,</em> October 22, 2015<br/>
<br/>
 On November 9, the <a href="http://ihr.ucsc.edu/organizer/uc-presidents-chair-in-feminist-critical-race-and-ethnic-studies/"><strong><em>UC Presidential Chair in Feminist Critical Race and Ethnic Studies</em></strong></a> at UC Santa Cruz will examine the issue of police and prisons with a free public lecture by Ruth Wilson Gilmore.<br/>
<br/>
 The title of her talk is &#8220;Organized Abandonment &amp; Organized Violence: Devolution &amp; the Police.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker, co&#8211;chair of the UC Presidential Chair with literature professor Karen Yamashita, explained why they decided to bring Gilmore to campus<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Several years ago, Ruth Wilson Gilmore wrote a timely and significant book, 'Golden Gulag: Prisons, Surplus, Crisis, and Opposition in Globalizing California,' published by the University of California Press,&#8221; said Aptheker.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Gilmore, a well-known public intellectual, documents in this book the ways in which California embarked upon the largest prison-building project in its and the nation&#8217;s history. Her work critically examines the political and economic forces that combined to propel such an ominous course.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Aptheker added that despite a crime rate that has been steadily declining for decades, California continues to incarcerate, even in the face of federal court orders to reduce its overcrowded and repressive system.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Most affected by these rates of incarceration are men and women of color,&#8221; Aptheker noted.&#160; &#8220;One of the most inspiring chapters in Gilmore&#8217;s book is called &#8216;Mothers Reclaiming our Children,&#8217; also known as ROC, that has worked to help mothers engage in a collective and eminently practical movement to save their children from a profoundly racist criminal justice system.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Gilmore is professor of earth and environmental sciences, and American studies, and director of the Center for Place, Culture, and Politics, at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.<br/>
<br/>
 She is co-founder of several grassroots social justice groups, including Critical Resistance and California Prison Moratorium Project, and is a past president of the Central California Environmental Justice Network, and of the American Studies Association.<br/>
<br/>
 Aptheker said that in her appearance at UC Santa Cruz, Gilmore will expand upon and update the material in her book, and &#8220;allow us to understand more deeply how prisons, police, and economic powers in the state propel unconscionable attacks on communities of color in particular, and young people more generally.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>The UC Presidential Chair in Feminist Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies</strong> at UC Santa Cruz, which began in Fall 2012, is committed to increasing understanding of the ways in which gender, race, sexuality and class form interlocking systems of domination.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The prison-industrial complex is one of the most egregious forms of injustice and understanding its workings and its connections to larger economic and political forces is part of our educational mission,&#8221; said Aptheker.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;In addition we seek to give students and faculty working in Feminist Studies and in Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies, and many other departments and programs on campus, an opportunity to meet in smaller groups with our visitors for more in-depth discussions, as they will in the case of Professor Gilmore.&#8221;</p>

<hr/>
<p>The annual Open Enrollment (OE) period begins today, Thursday, October 29, and ends at 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, November 24. This is the time of year to review your health and welfare benefits, decide whether to make any changes, and enroll/re-enroll in a flexible spending account. OE Booklets were mailed to home addresses this week (if you haven't received a booklet or were hired after August 31, 2015 you can contact the campus Benefits Office for a copy). All Open Enrollment information will also be online: start at <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/</a> and follow the links to 2016 Open Enrollment page. While there are few changes this year, it is always a good idea to review the OE booklet and consider all of your available choices.</p>
<p>The Office of the President worked diligently to hold down costs for faculty and staff while continuing to provide a full array of plan choices. The same suite of plans available in 2015 will continue in 2016. Most employees will see either a slight decrease or an increase of less than $6 in their monthly premiums. Although UC Care increases will range from $18 to $52 per month, this plan provides the most flexibility in provider choice, including affordable access to UC medical center facilities and, locally, to the Palo Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF). The University will continue to pay the larger share of medical plan premiums&#8211;on average 87percent. <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/health-plans/medical/employee-plan-costs-2016.html">The plan premiums can be found online</a>. In addition, the University will continue to cover 100 percent of the premium cost for the vision and dental plans for employees and dependents.</p>
<p>Some other 2016 plan changes, including several enhancements, are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>All plans will have improved coverage for travel immunizations.</li>
<li>As a result of the Affordable Care Act, some employees not previously eligible for benefits, will be eligible beginning January, 2016 (UC will determine the employees who now qualify for medical insurance and contact them directly).</li>
<li>The Blue Shield Health Savings Plan (HSP) will offer "Welvie" (an online tool to help members make decisions about surgeries)</li>
<li>Health Net Blue &amp; Gold will add the "Quit for Life" coaching to its current on-line smoking cessation program.</li>
<li>UC Care will add Ambulatory Surgical Center providers in the UC Select Tier ($100 co-pay)</li>
<li>The Core plan will add applied behavioral health (ABA) services for autism care.</li>
<li>Both the HSP and Core will offer <em>Oncology Practice of the Future</em>, a program that aids with cancer care.</li>
<li>For 2016, Pay Band 1 will not change. Pay Bands 2, 3, and 4 will change slightly.</li>
<li>ARAG (legal plan) is open for enrollment and some slight changes will result in fewer limitations and higher benefits maximums for certain services with no change in premium costs.</li>
<li>Wellness coaching and the $75 incentive will no longer be available as the emphasis on wellness will shift to campus and medical plan wellness programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes and other information are detailed in the OE information found in your OE Booklet and on-line at: <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/oe">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/oe</a></p>
<p>The UCSC Benefits Office will also provide the campus with a number of OE presentations.</p>

<p>UC continues to offer several medical plans to choose from. Each plan provides comprehensive coverage, including behavioral health benefits. But the cost, both in terms of premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, as well as provider choice and flexibility to use out-of-network doctors and hospitals, varies significantly. And if you plan to retire during 2016, please remember that the medical plan that you chose will carry into retirement, in most cases.</p>
<p>Please take time to review your 2016 options and choose the medical plan that best fits your needs. If you have questions or need assistance with your enrollment decisions, consider attending an Open Enrollment presentation. For individual assistance, please contact the campus Benefits Office at 459-2013.</p>

<li>Sobre: Inscripci&#243;n Abierta 2016</li>
</ul>
<p>El per&#237;odo anual de Inscripci&#243;n Abierta (<em>Open Enrollment [OE]</em> en Ingl&#233;s) comienza hoy, jueves, 29 de octubre, y termina a las 5 de la tarde del martes, 24 de noviembre. Esta es la &#233;poca del a&#241;o para revisar sus beneficios de salud y bienestar, decidir si quiere hacer alg&#250;n cambio, e inscribirse/re-inscribirse en una cuenta de gastos flexibles (<em>flexible spending account [FSA]</em> en Ingl&#233;s). Los folletos de Inscripci&#243;n Abierta fueron enviados a los domicilios particulares esta semana (si usted no ha recibido el folleto o fue contratado despu&#233;s del 31 de agosto de 2015, puede ponerse en contacto con la Oficina de Beneficios del campus para conseguir una copia del folleto). Toda la informaci&#243;n sobre la Inscripci&#243;n Abierta estar&#225; tambi&#233;n en l&#237;nea: comience en <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/</a> y siga los enlaces para la p&#225;gina de Inscripci&#243;n Abierta 2016 (<em>2016 Open Enrollment</em> en Ingl&#233;s). Aunque hay pocos cambios este a&#241;o, siempre es una buena idea revisar el folleto de Inscripci&#243;n Abierta (Open Enrollment en Ingl&#233;s) y considerar todas las opciones disponibles para usted.</p>
<p>La Oficina del Presidente trabaj&#243; diligentemente para mantener bajos los costos para el profesorado y el personal, al mismo tiempo que contin&#250;a ofreciendo una gama completa de opciones de planes. El mismo paquete de planes disponibles en 2015 continuar&#225; en 2016. La mayor&#237;a de los empleados ver&#225;n una peque&#241;a disminuci&#243;n o un peque&#241;o aumento de menos de 6 d&#243;lares en sus primas mensuales. Aunque los aumentos de UC Care oscilar&#225;n entre $18.- y $52.- por mes, este plan proporciona la mayor flexibilidad en la elecci&#243;n del proveedor, incluyendo acceso asequible a las facilidades del centro m&#233;dico de la UC, y a nivel local a la Fundaci&#243;n M&#233;dica de Palo Alto (<em>Palo Alto Medical Foundation [PAMF]</em> en Ingl&#233;s). La universidad continuar&#225; pagando la mayor parte del costo de las primas de los planes de medicina: un promedio del 87 por ciento. Las primas del plan se encuentran en l&#237;nea en <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/health-plans/medical/employee-plan-costs-2016.html">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/health-plans/medical/employee-plan-costs-2016.html</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Adem&#225;s, la universidad continuar&#225; cubriendo el 100% del costo de la prima para los planes de la vista y dental, para los empleados y sus dependientes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Algunos otros cambios en los planes para 2016, incluyendo varias mejoras, se enumeran a continuaci&#243;n:</p>
<ul>

Y si usted est&#225; planeando jubilarse en el 2016, por favor recuerde que el plan m&#233;dico que eligi&#243; es el plan m&#233;dico que llevar&#225; a la jubilaci&#243;n, en la mayor&#237;a de los casos.</p>

<p>"We will explore what the principle means from both an institutional and individual viewpoint," said group chair Ricki Carr, "and look at different ways we can incorporate the principle into our everyday lives to ultimately make the way we view our workplace as well as our larger community more positive and insightful."</p>
<p>The workshops will be 90 minutes long. Attendees are encouraged to bring lunch, if desired. Refreshments will be provided.</p>
<p>The first event is from noon to 1:30 p.m. November 24 in Kerr Hall, Room 212. It will focus on the principle of "diverse": We embrace diversity in all its forms and we strive for an inclusive community that fosters an open, enlightened and productive environment.</p>
<p>Frank Widman, a member of the group and the Training and Development Manager for the campus, will be the presenter.</p>
<p>For those people who work off campus or at the base of campus, the Staff Diversity Group is arranging carpools to get to Kerr Hall. If you need a ride or want to participate in this, please contact Carr at ricki@ucsc.edu.</p>
<p>The rest of the workshops are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purposeful - Tuesday, December 15th, 2015</li>
<li>Open - Tuesday, January 26, 2016</li>
<li>Caring - Tuesday, February 23, 2016</li>
<li>Just - Tuesday, March 22, 2016</li>
<li>Discipline - Tuesday, April 26, 2016</li>
<li>Celebrative - Tuesday, May 24, 2016</li>
</ul>
<p>"Everyone's viewpoint and experience matters and I believe that together we can make a difference and see positive change," Carr said."</p>
<p>Those who attend four or more workshops will be presented a certificate at a celebration the group will hold in June 2016.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a26abeea8072704638f4f2227b2d6963"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1325408400000</start-date><path>/2015/10/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/10/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1420064112334</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1420064112334</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
