The top five in terms of future job openings over the next five years are food prep and service, retail sales, farming, personal care, and building and grounds cleaning and maintenance. <br/><br/>Approximately 60 students, many of them Spanish speakers from working class families, interviewed residents at work places, Laundromats, bus stops, parks, and occasionally door-to-door. <br/><br/>Other students completed data analysis while others created an interactive website that features photographs and oral narratives collected from 75 in-depth interviews in the field. The website will be debuted at the museum event on Thursday<br/><br/>&#8220;The event is about explaining the experience of low-wage work,&#8221; McKay said, &#8220;telling the stories, not just the numbers.&#8221; <br/><br/>The research also uncovered examples of pay issues such as wage theft, health and safety concerns, and cases of discrimination and harassment.&#160; The project is an example of&#160; &#8220;community-initiated&#8221; research, McKay said, explaining that California Rural Legal Assistance approached the Center for Labor Studies with the idea and some funding for a study of low-wage workers who were transitioning from field work to service jobs. <br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s researched-focused and part of the university&#8217;s public service mission that directly affects the community,&#8221; he said.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://workingfordignity.ucsc.edu</url><title>Working for Dignity website</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="10b3fe6d807270173df029584eb7393b"><name>chavez-convocation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Barrios Unidos founder to speak at 12th Cesar Chavez Convocation</title><summary>Daniel “Nane” Alejandrez, founder and executive director of Barrios Unidos, is the keynote speaker for the 12th annual Cesar Chavez convocation, 7 p.m. Tuesday, May 12, at the College Nine/Ten Multi-purpose Room on the UC Santa Cruz campus.

Revolutions</i></b></a>--the second installment of NBC Bay Area&#8217;s year-long documentary series <i>Bay Area Revelations</i>--premiering Saturday May 9, at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Narrated by Emmy Award-winning actor Peter Coyote, the one-hour film examines the San Francisco Bay Area&#8217;s history in leading political and social movements, beginning with the Free Speech Movement and covering gay liberation, black power, drug culture, AIDS, assassinations, cults, and same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>The program is told primarily through personal interviews with individuals who played a major role in these pivotal points in history&#8212;also including Senator <strong>Dianne Feinstein</strong>, Lieutenant Governor <strong>Gavin Newsom</strong>, Mayor <strong>Willie Brown</strong>, State Assemblyman <strong>Tom Ammiano</strong>, UC Santa Cruz alumnus and author <strong>David Talbot</strong>, and San Francisco District Attorney and civil rights lawyer <strong>Terence Hallinan</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Rebels &amp; Revolutions</em> will shed light on a significant time in the Bay Area&#8217;s history, weaving together stories that are not familiar to most,&#8221; noted Rich Cerussi, president and general manager of NBC Bay Area. &#8220;Our intention with this second film in our <i>Bay Area Revelations</i> series is to reflect on those little known, powerful moments that were each responsible for sparking a revolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aptheker taught one of the country's largest and most influential introductory feminist studies courses for nearly three decades at UC Santa Cruz. She has played a role in major historical events ranging from her co-leadership of the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley, the movement against the war in Vietnam, and the trial of Angela Davis, to the building of the Women's Studies Department at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Aptheker was recently named a University of California Presidential Chair in Feminist Critical Race and Ethnic Studies at UC Santa Cruz, and is currently teaching a course on feminism and social justice.</p>
<p>Founder of the popular San Francisco-based web magazine <i>Salon</i>, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/05/david-talbot.html"><em><b>David Talbot</b></em></a> has been hailed as a &#8220;web pioneer&#8221; by the <i>New York Times</i>, as well as "one of 50 people who matter most in the new media world" by <i>Newsweek</i>.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz alum has written for <i>The New Yorker, Rolling Stone</i>, and <i>Time</i>; served as a senior editor for <i>Mother Jones</i> magazine; and was a features editor for the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i>.</p>
<p>Talbot&#8217;s latest book is <i>Season of the Witch: Enchantment, Terror and Deliverance in the City of Love</i>, a dynamic story of the turbulent years in San Francisco from 1967 to 1982.</p>

<p>Campus elections are a hallmark spring-quarter event. Each year, hundreds of students participate as candidates, as authors of proposed referenda, and as volunteers assisting with the process. Thousands of students will participate as voters!</p>
<p>Every election, students make critical decisions about undergraduate and graduate student leadership for the upcoming year. The Student Union Assembly and the Graduate Student Association put forth candidates for a variety of leadership positions, including chair and president, respectively; those who are elected assume their roles on July 1 and will serve a one-year term during which they act as principal spokespeople for the student body.</p>
<p>Utilizing an online electronic ballot administered by our colleagues in Institutional Research, students also vote on proposed campus-based fees. Section 80 of the <a href="http://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/student-handbook/index.html">Student Handbook</a> gives students the authority to make decisions about taxing themselves for specific programs and initiatives. If a proposed campus-based fee or referendum is approved by voters, students pay that fee for the specified period of time. All referenda include a return-to-aid component, whereby 33 percent of the fees collected go to financial aid to help needy students pay the fee.</p>
<p>This year, there are three proposed fees on the ballot for undergraduate students, including:</p>
<p>&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Measure 61: CruzCare Access for All - Injury and Illness Health Center Fee<br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Measure 62: Athletics Operations Enhancement Fee<br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Measure 63: Amendment to Measure 30: Strengthening Access to Learning Support Services</p>
<p>In order to pass a new campus-based fee, a minimum of 25 percent of all students registered during spring quarter must vote on the initiative to establish a minimum voting threshold; of those voting, at least 65 percent must vote yes in order for the initiative to pass.</p>
<p>Voting this year will take place between May 12-18. All students who were registered as of the third week of spring quarter are eligible to vote.</p>

The team discovered an exceptionally luminous galaxy more than 13 billion light years from Earth and determined its exact distance using the powerful MOSFIRE instrument on the Keck I 10-meter telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.</p>
<p>These observations, published May 5 in <i>Astrophysical Journal Letters</i>, confirmed it to be the most distant galaxy currently measured, setting a new record. Known as EGS-zs8-1, the galaxy was originally identified based on its particular colors in images from NASA's Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes. It is one of the brightest and most massive objects in the early universe.</p>
<p>"One of the most dramatic discoveries from Hubble and Spitzer in recent years is the unexpected number of these very bright galaxies at early times close to when the first galaxies formed. We still don't fully understand what they are and how they relate to the very numerous fainter galaxies," said coauthor Garth Illingworth, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Forming stars</strong></p>
<p>The new distance measurement also enabled the astronomers to determine that EGS-zs8-1 was still forming stars very rapidly, about 80 times faster than our galaxy does today.</p>
<p>"It has already built more than 15 percent of the mass of our own Milky Way today. But it had only 670 million years to do so. The universe was still very young then," said lead author Pascal Oesch of Yale University, who began studying these bright young galaxies as a Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Only a handful of galaxies currently have accurate distances measured in this very early universe. "Every confirmation adds another piece to the puzzle of how the first generations of galaxies formed in the early universe," said coauthor Pieter van Dokkum of Yale. "Only the largest telescopes are powerful enough to reach to these large distances."</p>
<p>The discovery was only possible thanks to the relatively new MOSFIRE instrument on the Keck I telescope, which allows astronomers to efficiently study several galaxies at the same time. Harland Epps, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, designed the optics for MOSFIRE.</p>
<p>Measuring galaxies at these extreme distances and characterizing their properties is a main goal of astronomy over the next decade. The observations see EGS-zs8-1 at a time when the universe was undergoing very important changes: the hydrogen between galaxies was transitioning from a neutral to an ionized state. "It appears that the young stars in the early galaxies like EGS-zs8-1 were the main drivers for this transition called reionization," said coauthor Rychard Bouwens of the Leiden Observatory, who began studying the earliest galaxies with Illingworth as a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;New questions</strong></p>
<p>These new Keck Observatory, Hubble, and Spitzer observations together also pose new questions. They confirm that massive galaxies already existed early in the history of the universe, but that their physical properties were very different from galaxies seen around us today. Astronomers now have very strong evidence that the peculiar colors of early galaxies seen in the Spitzer Space Telescope images originate from a very rapid formation of massive, young stars, which interacted with the primordial gas in these galaxies.</p>
<p>The new observations underline the very exciting discoveries that NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will enable when it is launched in 2018. In addition to pushing the cosmic frontier to even earlier cosmic times, JWST will be able to dissect the galaxy light of EGS-zs8-1 seen with the Spitzer Space Telescope and will provide astronomers with much more detailed insights into its gas properties.</p>
<p>"Our current observations indicate that it will be very easy to measure accurate distances to these distant galaxies in the future with the James Webb Space Telescope," Illingworth said. "The result of JWST's upcoming measurements will provide a much more complete picture of the formation of galaxies at the cosmic dawn."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2014/2015/22/</url><title>HubbleSite News Release</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="29fb1e95807270173df029585a7f42c3"><name>cave-lab</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'CAVE Lab' offers immersive virtual reality tools for research and teaching</title><summary>A new multi-disciplinary facility featuring interactive 3-D visualization technology is available to researchers across campus.</summary><keywords>Sri Kurniawan, Arnav Jhala, Noah Wardrip-Fruin, CAVE, virtual reality</keywords><start-date>1430895600000</start-date><display-name>"CAVE Lab" offers immersive virtual reality tools for research and teaching</display-name><path>/2015/05/cave-lab</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/cave-lab</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1430928432714</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1431014096312</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/cave-users-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/cave-users-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cave-users-400.jpg</name><display-name>cave-users-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>88532</file-size><width>400</width><height>388</height></image><image-alt>three people in the cave lab</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/cave-users-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/cave-users-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cave-users-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cave-users-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18184</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>cave lab user wearing VR glasses</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The CAVE Lab allows multiple users to become fully immersed in the same virtual environment at the same time.

Called the CAVE Lab, it opens up new possibilities for research and education, said Sri Kurniawan, associate professor of computational media and computer engineering.</p>
<p>The facility features a room-sized, advanced visualization system called a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). It combines high-resolution, stereoscopic projection and 3-D computer graphics to create a complete sense of presence in a virtual environment. The projections cover three walls and the floor, and the CAVE allows multiple users to become fully immersed in the same virtual environment at the same time. The CAVE Lab also features moveable walls that allow the environment to be reconfigured for different applications.</p>
<p>"This has applications for faculty in computing, game design, psychology, the arts, and a wide range of other fields. People have a lot of ideas for how they could use it," Kurniawan said.</p>
<p><strong>Human cognition</strong></p>
<p>In psychology, for example, the CAVE is a useful tool for research on human cognition and behavior, she said. The virtual environment can be used to study cognitive processing of information presented in increasingly complex environments, or to assess people with phobias by creating controlled simulations of heights or other potential triggers. The technology can also be useful for visualization of large, complex scientific datasets.</p>
<p>Kurniawan's own projects include health-related games currently implemented on desktop or mobile devices, such as a game for improving maternity care that simulates a maternity ward. Transferring the games to the CAVE environment would be a big undertaking, but could have many advantages. "The CAVE can make the user experience much more realistic and immersive," she said.</p>
<p>Kurniawan led an interdisciplinary team of faculty that won funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), plus matching funds from campus, to buy the equipment and pay for renovation of a room in the Engineering 2 building to house the CAVE Lab. The other principal investigators on the grant are Michael Mateas and Noah Wardrip-Fruin, professors of computational media; Warren Sack, professor of film and digital media; and Steven Whittaker, professor of psychology.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual world</strong></p>
<p>Wardrip-Fruin, who has used similar facilities at other institutions, said a CAVE can transport people into an alternate reality in a way that no other technology can do. "There is a big difference between experiencing virtual reality with a head-mounted display and experiencing it in a CAVE. It's a much more powerful experience of being present with the virtual world," he said.</p>
<p>The facility is a good match for some of the research projects already under way in the Baskin School of Engineering and other divisions on campus, Wardrip-Fruin said. Potential users include faculty studying human-computer interaction, computer graphics, assistive technology, language and linguistics, game design, and digital arts and new media.</p>
<p>Arnav Jhala, an assistant professor of computational media whose research includes work on avatars with believable full-body interaction, said immersive visualization systems can significantly improve experiential learning in educational virtual environments. "Many educational environments, such as those for military or medical training, require players to be immersed in the surroundings of their target environment," Jhala said. "The CAVE Lab provides us with an environment for developing and evaluating these applications."</p>
<p>The CAVE Lab features Mechdyne <a href="http://www.mechdyne.com/hardware.aspx?name=CAVE">CAVE</a> and <a href="http://www.mechdyne.com/hardware.aspx?name=FLEX+%26+T-FLEX">FLEX</a> technology and uses the <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity">Unity</a> development platform for creating 3-D interactive environments. In addition to the $300,000 NSF grant, matching funds for the purchase of the CAVE, as well as room renovation and graduate student support costs, were provided by the UC Santa Cruz Office of Research, the Office of the Dean of the Baskin School of Engineering, and the Departments of Computer Engineering and Computer Science. These funds do not cover ongoing expenses and staffing of the facility, which will operate on a pay-for-use model.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2a2b7dde807270173df02958c2c5cefc"><name>pogpnip-fires</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Advisory – Fires at Pogonip</title><summary>In the past year, the university has been notified about numerous illegal fires on Upper Campus and city/state park lands adjacent to campus.</summary><start-date>1430895600000</start-date><display-name>Community Advisory – Fires at Pogonip</display-name><path>/2015/05/pogpnip-fires</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/pogpnip-fires</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1430931602634</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1430931757555</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In the past year, the university has been notified about numerous illegal fires on Upper Campus and city/state park lands adjacent to campus. Members of the community, UC Santa Cruz Police Department, Santa Cruz Police Department, and Park Rangers have reported significant amounts of trash, property damage and abandoned campfires throughout these protected areas on and near our campus.</p>
<p>The danger is real. The threat of fire on or adjacent to our campus is serious and potentially devastating; current dry conditions have created an explosive environment.</p>
<p>In addition to being counter to our environmentally friendly and sustainable campus practices, these fires are very concerning because of the potential hazards they create. An illegal fire creates serious risk for loss of life or property.</p>
<p>So, how can you help?</p>
<p>Do you know people who create fire-pits, start illegal campfires or leave trash behind? Help educate them about the impact and risks by referring them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wildfire information: <a href="http://www.smokeybear.com" title="Smokey Bear - Only You Can Prevent Wildfires">http://www.smokeybear.com</a></li>
<li>Back woods litter: <a href="http://www.wilderness.net/nwps/threatsoveruse" title="Wilderness.net - Overuse">http://www.wilderness.net/nwps/threatsoveruse</a></li>
<li>Report illegal burning and backwoods fires immediately by calling 9&#8211;1&#8211;1.</li>
<li>If you see something out of the ordinary while in Upper Campus, Pogonip or other wilderness area, notify the authorities (9&#8211;1&#8211;1, or use the <a href="http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/i-want-to/report">City of Santa Cruz reporting site</a>).</li>
<li>Request medical assistance by calling 9&#8211;1&#8211;1. This is also for anyone you see who may be coming out of the woods intoxicated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from being dangerous and putting our campus and surrounding community at risk, we also want students to know illegal fires or illegal parties can carry fines, criminal consequences and conduct action through the university.</p>
<p>Section 4421 of the Public Resources Code states that no person shall set fire or cause fire to be set to any forest, brush, or other flammable material which is on any land that is not his/her own, or under his/her legal control, without the permission of the owner, lessee, or agent of the owner or lessee of the land.</p>

<p>It was a chance encounter with that ill-fated astronomer that led UC Santa Cruz grad student Tuguldur Sukhbold from his science-poor country, where he had to build his own telescopes, to the wooded campus in Santa Cruz where he is doing advanced research in astrophysics.</p>
<p>And, it was the opportunities he got at UC Santa Cruz, he said, that allowed him to organize a project that, last year, delivered telescopes to 7 percent of the schools in Mongolia so that science-starved kids might be exposed to the wonders of the universe.</p>
<p>"A lot of these kids will probably never travel to another country, or even travel to a city," said Tuguldur of a country where horses outnumber people and where science education has lagged in the past 20 years. "Their world view is very limited. But with these telescopes, even if they can't see the world, they can see the universe."</p>
<p>Tuguldur, 25, who goes by one name in his country, grew up on the steppes of Mongolia, learning, like many of his compatriots, to ride a horse at the age of 3. By the time he was a teenager he'd moved to the capital city, Ulaanbaatar.</p>
<p>"I started looking up into the sky," Tuguldur said. "I began to wonder what it was all about and where did I come from and why was I here. I thought I might get answers from science."</p>
<p>The difficulty was that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had strong influence and financial ties to the country, Mongolia's educational system took a hit and science was one of the casualties.</p>
<p>Tuguldur began building his own telescopes using instructions he found on the Internet. He formed an astronomy club, and he and his friends peered into the heavens. Still, he understood that science was a dead-end job in Mongolia and he prepared to become a lawyer.</p>
<p>But that meeting with the ill-starred astronomer changed everything. The scientist had once been part of a project started by the University of Arizona that searched for asteroids from posts around the world. He'd been given a telescope but, one night, the device was struck by lightning and the project came to a halt.</p>
<p>Still wearing the worn University of Arizona T-shirt he'd been given by the American scientists, the astronomer told Tuguldur that Arizona was the center of astronomical research and that he should try to go to school there.</p>
<p>So, Tuguldur did.</p>
<p>He got a scholarship, struggled to learn English&#8212;although he was fluent in the mathematics required for physics&#8212;and got his bachelor's degree. He came to UC Santa Cruz for his advanced degrees because of its faculty and "because it is one of the best places for what I do."</p>
<p>Still, his homeland was always on his mind.</p>
<p>Tuguldur applied for and won a $6,000 grant from the International Astronomical Union. Together with a friend, Purevdorj Davaa, who is still in Mongolia, they purchased 44 four-and-a-half-inch, F/7.9 Newtonian telescopes from which kids could see craters on the moon, ice caps on Mars, the rings of Saturn, and the moons of Jupiter.</p>
<p>Some of the telescopes were delivered to city schools, but many went into the rural steppes where raising livestock&#8212;horses, camels, goats, sheep, and cattle&#8212;is still the central occupation.</p>
<p>"I had this dream that it would be really great to get a lot of money and bring telescopes to Mongolia, especially to the countryside," Tuguldur said. "I thought that would be life-changing. I wanted to share the joy."</p>
<p>Besides delivering the telescopes, Tuguldur and his partner also did several teacher trainings on Skype and wrote a manual in Mongolian that showed students how to use a telescope and gave them some basics in astronomy.</p>
<p>Next year, he and his friend hope to deliver 50 more telescopes and, one day, start a nonprofit that would press for more science education in the Mongolian curriculum.</p>
<p>Said Professor Greg Laughlin, chair of UC Santa Cruz's Astronomy and Astrophysics Department, "Tuguldur has consistently shown the courage, brilliance, and creativity that we here at UC Santa Cruz Astronomy all aspire to. His efforts are pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge, and, at the same time, are uniting people with common interests from across the globe."</p>
<p>"I am, in a way, very privileged," Tuguldur said, sitting on a couch in a quiet annex behind the Natural Sciences II building on the UC Santa Cruz campus. "When I look back in my country, I see a lot of people living just to get by, day-by-day. They don't have the luxury of spending time and resources to wonder about science."</p>
<p>He wants to change that, one telescope at a time.</p>

<p><b>Residence:</b> Sacramento</p>
<p><b>Title:</b> Retired&#160;staff director and chief consultant for the Senate Transportation Committee for the California legislature</p>
<h3>Why do you volunteer with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>Simply put, it's a way to give back to a special institution and a community that gave me opportunities to explore, learn, grow, fail, and succeed. Like many others, being a UC Santa Cruz student was the first time that I was really responsible for myself and my actions. It was probably the most special time of my life and started the roots of who I became and am still becoming. UC Santa Cruz provided an exceptional environment and opportunity that I want others to experience, and I want the ethos of the campus to spread and permeate the larger culture we live in.</p>
<h3>What types of things do you do as a Slug volunteer?</h3>
<p>I've been fortunate to serve on the Alumni Association Council&#8212;Board of Directors&#8212;for two stretches, 12 years in all, helping develop and guide the council's activities in awarding scholarships and producing programs and events for alumni. With others, I started and have tried to sustain the Sacramento-area chapter of the association (Sac Slugs); been a UC Santa Cruz delegate and advocate at the capitol on UC Day and at other times; and helped produce local send-off events for first-year students and their anxious parents. I've helped organize alumni gatherings, lectures, and social events and hosted visiting campus officials, participated in the written postcard campaign inviting alums to Alumni Weekend, and in general have talked up UC Santa Cruz to parents and students as a top university and tried to boost its visibility in the Sacramento region.</p>
<h3>What has been the most rewarding thing about volunteering with your alma mater?</h3>
<p>Seeing how all the efforts by so many volunteers have contributed to the development, growth, and success of UC Santa Cruz as one of the top young universities in the world. UC Santa Cruz is far more effective and respected than its age and size would otherwise dictate. I also really enjoy gathering with other Slugs who have a passion for Santa Cruz and who are doing amazing things with the tools and interests they developed there.</p>
<h3>Words of advice for those thinking of volunteering with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>There's no end or limit to the types of things that a volunteer can do to give back; as a group we have a tremendous amount of talent and creativity waiting to be tapped. Don't be shy about stepping up with your ideas and interests, even if you don't have a lot of time or don't feel that you know the ropes. The veterans will support you and connect you with the local network and resources available for alumni events. Frankly, there's always a receptive audience and place for new energy, ideas, and perspectives. If you want to produce an event or gathering, we'll help you do it!</p>
<h3>What's your best memory from your time at UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
Best memory? It can't be just one; many come to mind. A prominent and enduring moment was the day that I first visited campus while scouting colleges and came across a professor and class holding a seminar on benches in the redwoods. Wow, what is this place? That's when the relationship started. The Spring Thing Tutorial Benefit and Jefferson Airplane concert at the Cocoanut Grove at the end of our freshman year stands out, as does playing intramural sports, as opposed to being a Division I spectator. Other good memories are Fellows Dinners at Stevenson, political and social awakenings, and ultimately action&#8212;demonstrations, strikes, and teach-ins. These days it's reunion weekends, scholarship benefit dinners, and just strolling through the campus redwoods after a soaking rain.

Team members also sold donuts and athletic gear, worked on their r&#233;sum&#233;s, and picked up trash on the beach.</p>
<p>The unusual regimen was born not just from the financially strapped squad's need to raise money in order to compete, but also from Head Coach Todd Hollenbeck's decision to approach this team in a new way: by building solid human beings first, both on the court and in life.</p>
<p>"I tell the guys we're looking at the giant spectrum of life, not just one season," says Hollenbeck, sitting in a cluttered office in the West Field House. He wears red sweatpants, sandals, and a Slug volleyball T-shirt.</p>
<p>"It's not about wins and losses. It's how can we score points when we're not even touching the ball. We do that in the classroom, in applying for a job, and by volunteering. We're building a strong person from the ground up and adding volleyball."</p>
<p>The team not only ended the season with a 24-6 record and earned a visit to the NCAA Division III national championships in Hoboken, N.J., by finishing in the top 1 percent of independent programs in the West, but it also walked away with a team GPA of 3.1 and a sense that the squad had jelled into a professional and cohesive group.</p>
<p>"This year, it was about classiness and professionalism," says Jake Hurwitz (College Eight '15, marine biology), team captain who plays libero on the squad. "We held ourselves to a higher standard."</p>
<p>There's nothing glamorous about the men's Slug volleyball programs. Because of budgetary constraints and the fact most of the Division III volleyball teams are on the East Coast, the group has to raise $40,000 of its own money just to get to tournaments and competitions. Their uniforms are old, they cram five players into a two-bed hotel room for away games, and often get up at 4 a.m. to catch the cheapest flights to their matches. In addition, with majors including astrophysics, electrical engineering, physics, and economics, there are also long hours of study.</p>
<p>In the past, the stress of schoolwork, practice, fundraising, travel, and competition had sometimes led to a volatile season, but, this year, Hollenbeck took away the emphasis on wins and losses, and instead concentrated on doing the small things each day that build skills and character.</p>
<p>In addition to three hours of hard daily practice, the squad did beach cleanups, went to job fairs, and worked on their r&#233;sum&#233;s. On trips, they held study sessions and took required tests with Hollenbeck as proctor.</p>
<p>"If you can get each guy to focus on building character, it builds trust on the court," says Hollenbeck, who was inspired to walk this new path by a successful junior college coach he knows. The result was a squad that "did the right thing, even behind closed doors." They got good grades, showed class, and learned about trust, leadership, communication, and being a follower when needed&#8212;all skills that translate to a world beyond the university.</p>
<p>"The biggest win for us was the lessons," Hollenbeck says.</p>
<p>For Hurwitz, who plans to head to Europe for a professional volleyball tour in the fall, the season was an exercise in steadiness, in calming his sometimes fiery style, which led to more success.</p>
"It was always one step at a time, one foot in front of the other," he said. "At the end of the day you find you've taken a lot of steps."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="359938aa807270173df02958705a7696"><name>madau-honor</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astrophysicist Piero Madau inducted into Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars</title><summary>Piero Madau, distinguished professor of astronomy and astrophysics, was honored for achieving marked distinction in the physical sciences. </summary><keywords>Piero Madau</keywords><start-date>1431068400000</start-date><display-name>Astrophysicist Piero Madau inducted into Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars</display-name><path>/2015/05/madau-honor</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/madau-honor</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1431123343450</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1431123810796</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Hilary Lebow</name><title></title><phone/><email>lebow@ucolick.org</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/piero-madau-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/piero-madau-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>piero-madau-400.jpg</name><display-name>piero-madau-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>65187</file-size><width>400</width><height>503</height></image><image-alt>Piero Madau</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/piero-madau-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/piero-madau-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>piero-madau-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>piero-madau-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16255</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Piero Madau</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Piero Madau (Photo by Joson Images)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Piero Madau, distinguished professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, has been inducted into the Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars for achieving marked distinction in the physical sciences. Madau was among 15 new inductees honored at an event at Johns Hopkins University in April.</p>
<p>For the past two decades, Madau's work has focused on key events in the early evolution of the universe, including the dawn of galaxies, the formation of the first stars and black holes, and the reionization of the intergalactic medium. He studies the transition from the cosmic 'dark ages'--a cold, opaque, primordial universe of neutral hydrogen and helium gas--to the beginning of the 'cosmic renaissance' with the emergence of the first galactic systems and the chemical enrichment and reheating of the cosmos. Madau pioneered the use of 21-centimeter radiation as a probe of this epoch.</p>
<p>In recent years, his team has carried out some of the largest and most sophisticated computer simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies, the formation of their stellar disks, the assembly and clumpiness of their dark matter halos. "Understanding the dark and luminous sides of galaxy formation is currently a hot topic in astronomy," Madau said.</p>
<p>Born and educated in Italy, Madau earned his B.S. in physics at the University of Florence, where he graduated magna cum laude. He continued his education at the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste to obtain a Ph.D. in Astrophysics. After graduation, Madau came to the United States for a postdoctoral position at the California Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>He moved to Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) first as a Davis Fellow and then as a junior faculty. Located on the Johns Hopkins University campus, STScI operates the science program for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p>"Piero Madau was clearly a brilliant postdoctoral fellow here in Baltimore," said Colin Norman, professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins and astronomer at STScI. "Everyone knew he might well do something very important. Time went by, then one day at lunch time, Piero sat next to me and said, 'Well Colin, I've finally done something that might be significant.' All of the people around the table suddenly woke up."</p>
<p>Piero then produced a figure, as Norman recalls, which showed the cosmic history of star formation using Hubble Telescope data. "We thought this discovery might be found from Hubble, but not so clearly and quickly," said Norman. Now known as the "Madau diagram," it has a status in cosmology similar to the famous Hertzsprung&#8211;Russell diagram in stellar evolution. Matching the arc of cosmic star formation history has become one of the standard tests of theories of galaxy formation.</p>
<p>This discovery garnered world-wide attention from astronomers and contributed to Madau's induction into the Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars. Established in 1967, the society inducts former postdoctoral fellows, postdoctoral degree recipients, house staff, and faculty who served at least a year at Johns Hopkins and have since gained distinction in the fields of physical, biological, medical, social, or engineering sciences or in the humanities. Madau joins 625 other distinguished men and women in the society.</p>
<p>"I feel honored and privileged to have been invited to join this prestigious society," said Madau. "I will be forever grateful to my colleagues at Johns Hopkins and Space Telescope for their advice, ever-lasting interest in my research, and day-long discussions on the latest observational results and theories. They taught me to be daring, ambitious, and think outside of the box. Together, we studied some of the most grandiose events in the history of the universe."</p>
<p>After leaving the Space Telescope Science Institute, Madau was a tenured faculty member at the University of Cambridge, England, then came to UC Santa Cruz in 2000 as a professor of astronomy and astrophysics.</p>
<p>Last year, Madau was received the 2014 Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics, awarded jointly by the American Institute of Physics (AIP) and the American Astronomical Society (AAS) to recognize outstanding work in astrophysics. Madau was also part of a team of UCSC astronomers who captured the first image of a distant quasar illuminating a filament of the "cosmic web," which is thought to connect galaxies throughout the universe. The team was recognized by the editors of Physics World for one of the "top ten breakthroughs" of 2014.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/01/madau-heineman-prize.html</url><title>Astrophysicist

Arboretum' by 15-year-old Kelly McCandless</article-subhead><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Arboretum will host a family-friendly nature walk and book signing on Sunday, May 17, from 9 a.m. to noon, featuring Kelly McCandless, the 15-year-old author of <i>The Budding Naturalist's Guide to the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum.</i></p>
<p>According to McCandless, whose parents enrolled her in a nature awareness program at the Arboretum when she was 12, the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum is a unique sanctuary for both wildlife and people. "It has an amazing amount and variety of birds and supports so much other wildlife, too," she said. "It's close to town and very people-friendly, and the paths are well-tended and easy to use."</p>
<p>Joining McCandless at the May 17 event will be Todd Newberry, professor emeritus of biology at UC Santa Cruz and a renowned Santa Cruz birder, who met the young naturalist on one of the regular bird walks he leads at the Arboretum. Newberry said he was impressed by her skills as a naturalist and her plans for the book. The book is not only a useful guide for identifying the birds and other animals found in the Arboretum, it is also full of tips for learning to notice more about how wild things lead their lives, he said.</p>
<p>"She has learned to notice, and that's what this book is about. It enriches the experience of seeing an animal," said Newberry, who contributed a preface and some notes to the book.</p>
<p>McCandless said Newberry shared his knowledge and stories with her and provided guidance and support as she worked on the book. "It was amazing being able to work with him," she said. "I hope the book will give budding naturalists of any age a desire to learn more about the natural world and feel inspired to explore nature throughout their lives."</p>
<p>Elise McCandless, Kelly's mother (and a UCSC alumna [Cowell '87] and staff member), said that for almost four years Kelly has spent one day a week at the Arboretum studying and exploring. "This connection with nature was life changing for her," she said. "She met Todd Newberry on a bird walk at the Arboretum, and I think right away he recognized the deep appreciation that she shares with him for the Arboretum and their similar beliefs about not just learning <i>about</i> nature, but letting nature teach us."</p>
<p>Jessica Fiske Bailey, executive director of the Arboretum, said she is delighted with the book and hopes it will bring new visitors to the Arboretum. "I think this book will help people engage with the collections and the environment here in new ways," she said. "Kelly shows what an inspiring place this is and how people of all ages can interact with nature in a variety of ways at the Arboretum.

Lord</strong> (Film and Digital Media) were honored at an inaugural luncheon to recognize the contributions of emeriti faculty in building the programs, reputation, and physical structures of the Arts Division.&#160;</p>
<p>Acting Arts Dean Martin Berger presented Watts with the "Outstanding Mentorship Award" for his remarkable dedication to undergraduate teaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;Several years before I met Lewis, I already knew that he was a gifted and dedicated teacher,&#8221; said Berger.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had made it a point of attending the annual Irwin Awards ceremony in the Art Department at which students have the opportunity to make brief remarks.&#160;Year after year, I heard Lewis thanked at the event by multiple students for the profound effect he had on their art and careers.&#160;It was obvious to me that here was a teacher who was doing everything right."</p>
<p>Art alumna Alyssa Cuellar paid tribute to Watts&#8217;s mentorship, noting how he gives voice to both students in his classes and disempowered groups in his photographs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to say, &#8216;I want to be like Lewis when I grow up,&#8217; said Cuellar in her remarks. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never met an artist whose work I appreciate as much as their company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a multitude of qualities that make Lewis a wonderful professor,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Paramount to my experience here, and my growth as an artist, is how you fostered a learning environment where your students felt first and foremost as artists.</p>
<p>"At a time in our lives when it was very easy to feel unimportant, you made me and my peers feel as if our voices--and perhaps more importantly our work--truly mattered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Current art major Brandon Pritzkat described the safe space Watts created for student experimentation, plus the validation he offered undergraduates through his belief that they have important stories to tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;His work about African-Americans in culture and history within the United States is culturally important for many different people, especially the African-American community,&#8221; Pritzkat added. &#8220;My most impactful course was Lewis&#8217;s class <i>Picturing Identity</i>. This was the most important class I&#8217;ve taken; he was able to talk about something very real.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Chip Lord was presented with</strong> the &#8220;Outstanding Post-Retirement Research Award.&#8221;</p>
<p>Associate film and digital media professor Rick Prelinger paid tribute to Lord, offering a brief survey of his work and career.</p>
<p>Prelinger reminded the audience that although Lord is internationally known primarily for two works of art--<i>Cadillac Ranch</i> (1974) and <i>Media Burn</i> (1975), his recent work extends the artist&#8217;s concerns for media and the environment by addressing the unique challenges we face in 21st-century America.</p>
<p>Berger emphasized that point as well, adding that Lord is truly an original thinker.</p>
<p>"I have long taught Chip's artwork to my history of art students, knowing that they would appreciate his playful and probing work,&#8221; added Berger. &#8221;It's become clear to me, however, that rather than seeing his early artwork as a mere reflection of 1960s or 1970s culture, they view it as relevant to the issues of today. To have created work 40 years ago that still speaks to the concerns of contemporary audiences is a remarkable achievement."</p>
<p>Berger noted that creating an annual recognition lunch is a way of forging closer ties with former faculty and drawing them more directly into the UC Santa Cruz arts community.&#160; He highlighted the contributions of the various arts emeriti faculty in attendance, including music professor <strong>Linda Burman-Hall,</strong> former arts dean <strong>Ed Houghton</strong>, and art historian <strong>Virginia Jansen</strong>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="44c08396807270173df02958ba6e3681"><name>aids-vaccine</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Persistence yields progress in AIDS vaccine research at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>Veteran vaccine researcher Phil Berman has developed a new approach based on an old vaccine and recent advances in HIV immunology</summary><keywords>Phil Berman, AIDS vaccine, HIV vaccine, gp120</keywords><start-date>1431500400000</start-date><display-name>Persistence yields progress in AIDS vaccine research at UC Santa Cruz</display-name><path>/2015/05/aids-vaccine</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/aids-vaccine</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1431377576737</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1432052878854</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="231" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aw_VESUr_oc" width="410"></iframe></embed><width>410</width><caption><span>Phil Berman, a veteran vaccine researcher now at the University of California, Santa Cruz, explains why he is optimistic about the prospects for an effective AIDS vaccine.</span></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/phil-berman2-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/phil-berman2-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>phil-berman2-400.jpg</name><display-name>phil-berman2-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>77601</file-size><width>400</width><height>289</height></image><image-alt>Phil Berman</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/phil-berman2-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/phil-berman2-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>phil-berman2-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>phil-berman2-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16780</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Phil Berman</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Veteran vaccine researcher Phil Berman is the Baskin Professor of Biomolecular Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;(Photo by C.

Since his arrival at UC Santa Cruz in 2006, Berman has established a major vaccine research effort funded by a series of grants from the National Institutes of Health, including two new grants in 2014 totaling $2.6 million.</p>
<p>The latest results from this effort have Berman sounding optimistic about the prospects for a vaccine that can be effective in protecting against HIV infection. His lab has developed new vaccine candidates that he said are promising enough to consider advancing into clinical trials within the next two years.</p>
<p>Berman has redesigned a vaccine that he invented while at Genentech and led through clinical testing at VaxGen. This earlier vaccine, called AIDSVAX, was used in combination with another experimental vaccine in a large-scale clinical trial in Thailand involving 16,000 people. This trial (known as RV 144) showed that the combined vaccine was safe and 31 percent effective in preventing new HIV infections.</p>
<p><strong>Protective effect</strong></p>
<p>After the results of the trial were released in 2009, Berman and other researchers pored over them to understand the nature of the protective effect. Although the effect was small, RV 144 is still the only clinical trial in which a vaccine has shown any protective effect at all against HIV infection.</p>
<p>"By analyzing the results from RV 144, we started to understand the response to the vaccine, and I developed some new ideas for how to improve it," Berman said. "By building on an existing vaccine concept, rather than developing a new one from scratch, we can save millions of dollars and years of time getting the new vaccine into the clinic."</p>
<p>Researchers believe that for an AIDS vaccine to be effective, it must stimulate the immune system to make "broadly neutralizing antibodies" that are effective against multiple strains of the virus. HIV is so highly mutable that replication of the virus in an infected person gives rise to a genetically diverse population of circulating virus, and this variability helps the virus evade detection and neutralization by the immune system.</p>
<p>A neutralizing antibody recognizes a foreign protein (called an antigen), and by binding to it is able to block or neutralize the infectivity of the virus. For example, neutralizing antibodies that target an HIV envelope protein called gp120 can block a crucial part of the infection process in which gp120 binds to a receptor on the surface of T cells. The AIDSVAX vaccine was based on the gp120 envelope protein.</p>
<p><strong>Elite neutralizers</strong></p>
<p>One key to improving the vaccine, Berman said, came from independent lines of investigation pointing to the importance of antibodies that recognize a specific segment of gp120 known as the V1/V2 domain. The RV 144 trial results showed that protection was correlated with antibodies to this domain. Meanwhile, broadly neutralizing antibodies to this domain were isolated from a rare group of people known as "elite neutralizers," who produce antibodies that potently neutralize multiple strains of the virus.</p>
<p>Studies of these broadly neutralizing antibodies yielded another crucial finding. The part of an antigen that is recognized by an antibody is called an epitope, and it is usually a specific sequence of amino acids in the antigen protein. Scientists studying antibodies from elite neutralizers, however, discovered that many of the most potent neutralizing antibodies actually recognize carbohydrate components called glycans that are attached to the gp120 envelope protein.</p>
<p>"We knew that these broadly neutralizing antibodies existed for many years, but it came as a great surprise that they were directed to carbohydrate epitopes rather than the more common amino acid epitopes," Berman said. "We found that the vaccine that gave partial protection in the RV 144 trial had very little of the kind of carbohydrate required to bind these antibodies."</p>
<p>So Berman's lab set out to produce antigens that would induce a strong antibody response to the glycan-dependent epitopes in the V1/V2 domain. Attaching the right kind of glycans to the protein was just one of the challenges. The envelope protein has dozens of epitopes, and most of the immune response is directed at ones that don't induce neutralizing antibodies. Compared to these so-called "decoy epitopes," the glycan-dependent epitopes are only weakly immunogenic. Berman decided to use fragments of gp120 to make protein scaffolds that would present to the immune system only the glycan-dependent epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies, while eliminating the other gp120 epitopes.</p>
<p>"The trick is to make the scaffolds fold up into the right three-dimensional shape, as well as incorporating the right glycans," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Immunogenicity studies</strong></p>
<p>Berman's lab is now developing cell lines genetically engineered to produce viral proteins with the right structure and glycan epitopes to bind to broadly neutralizing antibodies with high affinity. This strong binding suggests that vaccination with these antigens could stimulate the immune system to produce the broadly neutralizing antibodies. In a <a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/289/30/20526.abstract">paper published last year</a> in the <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry</i>, Berman's team described the results of immunogenicity studies of these antigens.</p>
<p>"I think we've got candidates that should be seriously considered for advancement to clinical testing," Berman said. "We started with a molecule that has already been tested in humans, and we've rebuilt it using envelope proteins and scaffolds with the right carbohydrates."</p>
<p>Berman's lab is continuing to generate and screen new cell lines, looking for those that give the most consistent and reproducible production of antigens that perform well in immunogenicity studies. Thanks to NIH funding, he now has the facilities and specialized equipment to conduct rapid screening of cell lines and produce large quantities of proteins for vaccine research.</p>
<p>Berman is also training the researchers and graduate and undergraduate students in his lab in the demanding techniques needed to develop this kind of recombinant vaccine. He noted that plans to repeat the RV 144 trial were stymied by the inability of other labs to reproduce the AIDSVAX vaccine, since VaxGen was no longer in operation. Similarly, he said, efforts to make Ebola antigens for a potential vaccine during the current outbreak in West Africa have been slowed by a shortage of researchers trained in these techniques.</p>
<p>"We're training people with the skills needed to respond to emerging diseases like Ebola," Berman said.</p>
<p>Berman's research is supported by grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).</p>

<p>Literature Professor Kirsten Gruesz has discovered and is now translating the oldest Latino-authored novel to appear in print in the United States. Published by Eusebio Jos&#233; Gomez in 1848 and uncovered by Kirsten during research in The Historic New Orleans Collection, this novel, <i>A Marriage Like Many Others</i>, pushes back the date of publication of the first Latino novel by four decades.</p>
<p>This process of discovery, analysis, and exposure&#8212;because Kirsten is translating the text and plans to share it with the world&#8212;is at the heart of what we do at this university. Scholars like Kirsten discover lost texts that enrich our understanding of those who came before us and expand our appreciation of those who have shaped our collective history.</p>
<p>This more robust, more inclusive picture is made possible by UC research, which is part of what makes it exciting to be a student at a major research university. Learning from faculty members who are themselves on the path of discovery is inherently engaging. As one colleague put it, professors here aren't telling a story that others are writing; they are writing the story.</p>
<p>Other scholars shed light on pressing issues of the day, such as the public-health impacts of underage drinking. Carlos Dobkin in economics recently compared the drinking behavior of individuals just under 21 to those just over 21 and found that the minimum legal drinking age does in fact inhibit alcohol consumption&#8212;by 20 percent. Age-based drinking restrictions also reduce mortality by almost 10 percent, due mostly to fewer motor vehicle accidents.</p>
<p>In light of current proposals to lower the drinking age to 18, Carlos's findings are particularly timely. Many, including college presidents in the Amethyst Initiative, make the case that our laws are out of date and should reflect the actual behavior of young people today. Carlos's findings can help individuals assess their risk&#8212;and can help governments assess the potential costs of lowering the legal drinking age.</p>
<p>During his recent TEDx Santa Cruz talk, genomics expert David Haussler recalled the "moment our blueprint became open source." David's team pulled off the amazing computing feat of assembling the first complete sequence of the human genome in 2000, powering the public consortium to victory in the race to crack our genetic code. But then the UCSC team did something their corporate competitor never would've done: they posted it on the internet, ensuring that our "genetic recipe" would remain unrestricted and available for free, forever, to everyone.</p>
<p>UCSC faculty like Kirsten, Carlos, and David share a fundamental commitment to open access that advances scholarship and facilitates research around the globe. As David mentioned, the UCSC Genome Browser gets more than 1 million hits per day from scientists around the world.</p>
<p>Scholarship in service of the public good. That's what we do at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, has discovered the first known quasar quartet: four quasars, each one a rare object in its own right, in close physical proximity to each other. The quartet resides in one of the most massive structures ever discovered in the distant universe (a "proto-cluster" of galaxies) and is surrounded by a giant nebula of cool dense gas.</p>
<p>The findings, published May 15 in <i>Science</i>, are based on observations using the 10-meter Keck I Telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Either the discovery is a one-in-ten-million coincidence, or cosmologists need to rethink their models of quasar evolution and the formation of the most massive cosmic structures, according to first author Joseph Hennawi of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany.</p>
<p><strong>Exceedingly rare</strong></p>
<p>Quasars constitute a brief phase of galaxy evolution, powered by the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy. During this phase, they are the most luminous objects in the universe, shining hundreds of times brighter than their host galaxies, which themselves contain hundreds of billions of stars. But these hyper-luminous episodes last only a tiny fraction of a galaxy's lifetime. As a result, quasars are exceedingly rare and are typically separated by hundreds of millions of light years from one another. The researchers estimate that the odds of discovering a quadruple quasar by chance is one in ten million.</p>
<p>How did they get so lucky? Clues come from peculiar properties of the quartet's environment. The four quasars are surrounded by a giant nebula of cool dense hydrogen gas, which emits light because it is irradiated by the intense glare of the quasars. In addition, both the quartet and the surrounding nebula reside in an unusual region of the universe with a surprisingly large amount of matter.</p>
<p>"There are several hundred times more galaxies in this region than you would expect to see at these distances," said Prochaska, the principal investigator of the Keck observations.</p>
<p><strong>Proto-cluster</strong></p>
<p>Given the exceptionally large number of galaxies, this system resembles the massive agglomerations of galaxies known as galaxy clusters that astronomers observe in the present-day universe. But because the light from this cosmic metropolis has been travelling for 10 billion years before reaching Earth, the images show the region as it was 10 billion years ago, less than 4 billion years after the big bang. It is thus an example of a proto-cluster, the progenitor or ancestor of a present-day galaxy cluster.</p>
<p>Piecing all of these anomalies together, the researchers tried to understand what appears to be their incredible stroke of luck. "If you discover something which, according to current scientific wisdom, should be extremely improbable, you can come to one of two conclusions: either you just got very lucky, or you need to modify your theory," Hennawi said.</p>
<p>The researchers speculate that some physical process might make quasar activity much more likely in certain environments. One possibility is that quasar episodes are triggered when galaxies collide or merge, because these violent interactions efficiently funnel gas onto the central black hole. Such encounters are much more likely to occur in a dense proto-cluster filled with galaxies, just as one is more likely to encounter traffic when driving through a big city.</p>
<p>"The giant emission nebula is an important piece of the puzzle, since it signifies a tremendous amount of dense cool gas," said coauthor Fabrizio Arrigoni-Battaia of MPIA. Supermassive black holes can only shine as quasars if there is gas for them to swallow, and an environment that is gas rich could provide favorable conditions for fueling quasars.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Unexpected</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, given the current understanding of how massive structures in the universe form, the presence of the giant nebula in the proto-cluster is totally unexpected, according to coauthor Sebastiano Cantalupo of UC Santa Cruz and ETH Zurich. "Our current models of cosmic structure formation based on supercomputer simulations predict that massive objects in the early universe should be filled with rarefied gas that is about ten million degrees, whereas this giant nebula requires gas thousands of times denser and colder," he said.</p>
<p>The discovery of the first quadruple quasar may force cosmologists to rethink their models of quasar evolution and the formation of the most massive structures in the universe.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="455ee1ac807270173df029581fd79db6"><name>high-frequency-trading</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Center for Analytical Finance workshop looks at high-frequency trading</title><summary>The chief economist of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will open a daylong workshop and conference on high-frequency trading, Friday, May 15 at UC Santa Cruz.</summary><start-date>1431385200000</start-date><display-name>high-frequency-trading</display-name><path>/2015/05/high-frequency-trading</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/high-frequency-trading</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1431387955562</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1431388091118</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The chief economist of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will open a daylong workshop and conference on high-frequency trading, Friday, May 15 at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

<p><a href="http://merrill.ucsc.edu/academics/focus-on-africa/index.html">"Focus on Africa,"</a> taught by documentary filmmaker Melvin Cox (Merrill, '73), has been offered through Merrill College. Cox is discussing Africa's current affairs with students and teaching them about methods to document the forum, June 3 to 5 in Cape Town.</p>
<p>Cox and college Provost Elizabeth Abrams developed the course to help students understand Africa in a more meaningful way before attending the World Economic Forum. The course is also a step toward re-establishing the college's historic ties to Africa, and to reinforcing Merrill's commitment to experiential education.</p>
<p>"This class meets Merrill's longstanding commitment to having students know the world around them and experience it, a vision embraced by founding provost Philip Bell and shared by benefactor Charles E. Merrill, Jr.," Abrams said. "I'm delighted to be able to support students in fulfilling that vision."</p>
<p>"We are greatly energized by the enthusiastic support the program has received - from students, faculty, the Merrill College administration and some rather incredible donors," Cox said. "The potential impact extends far beyond the UCSC campus."</p>
<p>Cox has produced many programs on Africa, as well as a documentary on J. Herman Blake, who came to UC Santa Cruz in 1966 as an assistant professor of sociology. He was the first African American on the faculty and also served as the Founding Provost of Oakes College.</p>
<p>Lisa Hickman, a senior with Merrill College majoring in art and history of art and visual culture, was drawn to the class by the opportunity to learn about Africa. Hickman said she uses photography as a way to expose stereotypes and saw the class and trip as way to channel her art to portray the continent in ways that challenge people's beliefs.</p>
<p>"This is the direction I'm supposed to go," Hickman said. "It's creating a greater purpose for myself. It's important for people to travel and see the world."</p>
<p>Next fall, Hickman will be spending the fall in Argentina learning two year's worth of Spanish in one quarter. A senior, she's planning to pursue a Ph.D. in visual studies.</p>
<p>Sterling Scott, a second year student studying human biology in College 8, decided to take the class after learning about it through the campus's African/Black Student Alliance (A/BSA).</p>
<p>"It didn't exactly fit with my major, but I said why not," Scott said. "I've always wanted to go to Africa, and health care does play a role in economics."</p>
<p>Scott sees the trip as a project of self-exploration, traveling to a place where he has connections. He hopes he'll return to the United States knowing more about himself.</p>
<p>Jonathan Fu, a fourth year Merrill College student majoring in politics and legal studies, was referred to the program by Abrams.</p>
<p>Fu, who spent the fall quarter in Israel, said visiting a country in person and being able to connect with people is an experience that can't be replaced by reading history books or news articles. Conflicts and issues also become much more nuanced.</p>
<p>"Traveling brings a humanity that's often lost when you read about these countries from a detached point of view," Fu said. "Any opportunity to travel outside the United States and learn is something you need to take advantage of."</p>
<p>Students have been preparing for the trip by conducting preliminary research on topics that will be on display at the forum, such as public health priorities, African media and technology initiatives, and ongoing infrastructure projects, including renewable energy research in South Africa and the building of a standard gauge rail line in Kenya. They've also been preparing the scripts, shooting plans and storyboards that will guide their work at the forum. The group of students will be taking the trip through the generous support of donors.</p>
<p>Scott and Fu, like the other students in the class, will also share the experience with their family and community, further educating people about the continent, its success and its challenges.</p>
<p>In fact, the class is helping re-establish the college's historic connections to Africa. For example, several former Merrill provosts and other founding faculty had scholarly and teaching connections to Africa, and Abdu B.K. Kasozi, who earned his Ph.D. from UC Santa Cruz in 1974, served as the executive director for Uganda's National Council for Higher Education.</p>
<p>"With this class," Cox said, "we are trying to rekindle the fire and reignite interest in Africa."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="491062bd807270173df02958f960a652"><name>weekend-power-interruption</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus utility power interruptions expected May 16-18</title><summary>Utility-supplied electric power at UC Santa Cruz will be disrupted from 11 p.m. Saturday, May 16 to 7 a.m. Sunday, May 17 and from 11 p.m. Sunday, May 17 to 6 a.m. Monday, May 18.</summary><start-date>1431414000000</start-date><display-name>Power interruptions May 16-18</display-name><path>/2015/05/weekend-power-interruption</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/weekend-power-interruption</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1431449920045</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1431451003147</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div class="WordSection1">
<p>The campus must test the primary power relay and breaker control systems to comply with PG&amp;E requirements when the new Cogeneration Plant is operating.&#160; The project testing requires planned electrical utility power service interruptions. To minimize disruption, the testing will take place during two testing windows:</p>
<p><b>Saturday, May 16, 2015 start at 11 p.m. end May 17, 2015 at 7 a.m.</b></p>
<p><b>Sunday, May 17, 2015 start at 11 p.m. end May 18, 2015 at 6 a.m.&#160; </b></p>
<p><b>Review the following three lists for the status of your building and check with your Building Coordinator for additional information:</b></p>
<p>A.&#160; Facilities <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that will experience utility power interruptions</span>.</p>
<p>B. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Facilities with critical <span style="text-decoration: underline;">emergency and standby power</span> supplied by generators</p>
<p>C.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Facilities that will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unaffected </span>by the utility interruptions.</p>
<p>Planning for the Cogeneration Plant start-up, testing and commissioning started two years ago. The planning included coordination meetings and a series of email notifications to update and inform all campus units.</p>
<p><b>Why is UCSC doing this project?</b></p>
<p>Because we own and plan to operate a cogeneration system that provides power in parallel with the PG&amp;E utility, a complex control and protective relaying system is required by PG&amp;E. The new cogeneration system will provide power to critical research equipment and facilities during extended utility outages, and produce heat used by the campus central hot water plant.</p>
<p>Our metering and protective relaying system carefully balances duration/type of service interruptions with risks of damaging our power generation/distribution equipment during a fault condition. The final testing and commissioning of the cogeneration plant will occur later in April for functionality testing and will be witnessed by PG&amp;E to insure coordination with their system.</p>
<p><b>A.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The following facilities will experience <span style="text-decoration: underline;">utility power service interruptions:</span></b></p>
<p><b>Saturday, May 16, 2015 start at 11 p.m., end May 17, 2015 at 7 a.m.</b></p>
<p><b>Sunday, May 17, 2015 start at 11 p.m.,&#160; end May 18, 2015 at 6 a.m.</b></p>
<p><b>Between six and eight service interruptions are expected during each testing window.</b>&#160;</p>

The state will increase funding of UC's base budget by 4 percent each year for the next four years, and a one-time infusion of nearly $440 million to the UC pension system will reduce the university's contribution, providing some budget relief to campuses. <br/><br/><a href="http://budget.universityofcalifornia.edu/">This proposal</a>, developed by the governor and UC President Janet Napolitano, provides budget stability&#8212;and undergraduates and their families won't face tuition increases this fall or next. That's the good news.<br/><br/>However, the overall budget picture remains challenging. Before today, UC Santa Cruz was facing a $7 million deficit for the coming fiscal year; that amount will go down in light of today's news, but it will not disappear. Enrolling more out-of-state and international students has brought critical new funds to campus in recent years, but the plan announced today would increase nonresident tuition costs by 5 percent annually for the next two years&#8212;a strategy we fear could jeopardize our, and other campuses', ability to attract more students from outside California.<br/><br/>We will learn more about the full impacts of the governor's budget proposal as it moves through the Legislature in coming weeks. For now, we are pleased that his revised budget marks progress toward the persistent goal of securing long-term financial stability for the University of California. We hope UC gets sufficient support from elected officials in Sacramento to preserve excellence, access, and opportunity for all qualified California high school graduates.<br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="590d7295807270173df029582a786f1f"><name>machotka-panunzio</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Emeritus psychology professor Pavel Machotka wins systemwide emeriti award</title><summary>Pavel Machotka, professor emeritus of psychology at UC Santa Cruz, has won a 2015 Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award that honors UC emeriti professors in the humanities and social sciences.</summary><start-date>1431716400000</start-date><display-name>Pavel Machotka</display-name><path>/2015/05/machotka-panunzio</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/machotka-panunzio</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1431718163027</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1431728652890</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/machotka-pavel-250.png</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/machotka-pavel-250.png</link><site>news</site><name>machotka-pavel-250.png</name><display-name>machotka-pavel-250.png</display-name><file-size>140736</file-size><width>250</width><height>352</height></image><image-alt>pavel machotka</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/machotka-pavel-80.png</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/machotka-pavel-80.png</link><site>news</site><name>machotka-pavel-80.png</name><display-name>machotka-pavel-80.png</display-name><file-size>15958</file-size><width>80</width><height>81</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>pavel machotka</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Pavel Machotka, emeritus professor of psychology</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/machotka-strade-e-cipressi-460.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/machotka-strade-e-cipressi-460.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>machotka-strade-e-cipressi-460.jpg</name><display-name>machotka-strade-e-cipressi-460.jpg</display-name><file-size>283539</file-size><width>460</width><height>382</height></image><image-alt>landscape painting</image-alt><image-caption>Machotka's 2008 painting "Strade e Cipressi."</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Pavel Machotka, professor emeritus of psychology at UC Santa Cruz, has won a 2015 Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award that honors UC emeriti professors in the humanities and social sciences.</p>
<p>His award is the seventh for a retired UC Santa Cruz professor since the awards program began in 1983. Only UCLA and UC Irvine have won as many. Also winning this year is Elizabeth Colson, professor emerita of anthropology, at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>The Panunzio awards are named for the late professor of sociology at UCLA often described as the architect of the UC Retirement System. He was particularly active in improving pensions and stipends for his fellow emeriti.&#160; The award honors research and activities since retirement and includes a $5,000 prize.&#160;</p>
<p>Machotka joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1970 and founded the Psychology of Aesthetics Department. He also served as provost of Porter College when it was known as College Five and served as chair of the Psychology Department and of the Academic Senate in 1992-94.</p>
<p><strong>Born in Prague</strong></p>
<p>He was born in Prague in 1936 shortly before the Nazi invasion. He fled Czechoslovakia with his family in 1948 after the Soviet communists took over. He attended the University of Chicago at age 16 where he saw first saw what would define his career,&#160;a C&#233;zanne painting. He went on to earn his Ph.D. at Harvard.</p>
<p>Machotka is considered one of the great scholars in the field of the psychology of aesthetics. His life-long love of C&#233;zanne&#8217;s art has resulted in lectures on the French painter around the world, a UC Santa Cruz course, and two published books.</p>
<p>As a painter himself, Machotka offers insights into C&#233;zanne&#8217;s working methods. His scholarly work since retiring from UCSC in 1994 has concentrated on the psychology of artistic creativity in general and the genius of C&#233;zanne's paintings in particular.&#160; One of his pioneering achievements is his approach to examining artworks using psychological means and analyzing how artist, context, and art medium all interact.</p>
<p><strong>C&#233;zanne motiffs</strong></p>
<p>An important contribution to the field was identifying numerous C&#233;zanne motifs, especially in and around Aix-en-Provence, France. His interest in locating the sites and comparing them to the artist's realization on canvas led to the publication of <i>Cezanne: Landscape into Art. </i>He has also published <i>C&#233;zanne: The Eye and the Mind.</i></p>
<p>Since retiring, Machotka has given talks, participated in international congresses, served on editorial and advisory boards, including Ph.D. dissertation committees and two scholarly journals concerned with the psychology of artistic creativity. He has also has worked to strengthen the scholarly capacities of two universities in the Czech Republic.&#160;</p>
<p>Bill Domhoff, UC Santa Cruz emeritus professor of psychology, who won the 2007 Panunzio award, nominated Machotka.</p>
<p>Michael Nauenberg, president of the UC Santa Cruz Emeriti Association and a Panunzio winner in 2013, said that after reading Machotka&#8217;s book on C&#233;zanne as part of the nominating process, he invited him to Santa Cruz from his home in Prague to speak at the <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2965">association&#8217;s bi-annual emeriti talk</a>. Machotka will speak on "Psychology and Art, and the Case of C&#233;zanne,&#8221; November 10 at the Music Recital Hall.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s award brings to seven the number of UC Santa Cruz professors to win the Panunzio Award. In addition to Domhoff (sociology) and Nauenberg (physics), the other winners are: Hayden White, history of consciousness, 2001; Thomas Pettigrew, psychology, 2009; Harry Berger Jr., literature, 2010; and Elliot Aronson, psychology, 2011.</p>
<p><strong>High-caliber faculty</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The stellar record of our campus in winning the Panunzio award is simply a reflection of the high caliber of the young faculty who were attracted to our campus early on, and who now are major scholars and leaders in their respective fields,&#8221; Nauenberg said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2965</url><title>Pavel Machotka's Emeriti Association talk</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="59411f0d807270173df02958b788eb72"><name>dream-challenge</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community effort provides new 'gold standard' for genomic data analysis</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz researchers contributed to a comprehensive assessment of methods for identifying mutations in cancer genomes.</summary><keywords>Josh Stuart, cancer genomics, DREAM Challenge, Somatic Mutation Calling</keywords><start-date>1431961200000</start-date><display-name>Community effort provides new 'gold standard' for genomic data analysis</display-name><path>/2015/05/dream-challenge</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/dream-challenge</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1431721549505</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1431960483558</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/josh-stuart-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/josh-stuart-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>josh-stuart-350.jpg</name><display-name>josh-stuart-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>88047</file-size><width>350</width><height>392</height></image><image-alt>Josh Stuart</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/josh-stuart-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/josh-stuart-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>josh-stuart-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>josh-stuart-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22094</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Josh Stuart</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Josh Stuart (Photo by C.

The results, published May 18 in <i>Nature Methods,</i> provide an important new benchmark for researchers, helping to define the most accurate methods for identifying somatic mutations in cancer genomes. The study could be the first step in creating a new global standard to determine how well cancer mutations are detected.</p>
<p>Coauthor Josh Stuart, professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, helped organize the ICGC-TCGA-DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge, which merged the efforts of the world's largest cancer genome sequencing consortia--the <a href="https://icgc.org/">International Cancer Genome Consortium</a> (ICGC) and <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a> (TCGA)--with those of <a href="http://sagebase.org/">Sage Bionetworks</a> and the <a href="http://dreamchallenges.org/">DREAM project</a> (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods). Other project leaders include cancer researchers at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR) and Oregon Health &amp; and Science University (OHSU).</p>
<p>"We owe it to cancer patients to interpret tumor DNA information as accurately as we can. This study represents yet another great example of harnessing the power of the open, blinded competition to take a huge step forward in fulfilling that vision," said Stuart, a lead TCGA representative on the project. "We still have important work ahead of us, but accurate mutation calls will give a solid foundation to build from."</p>
<p><strong>Tumor genomes</strong></p>
<p>The SMC Challenge, which was initiated in November 2013, was an open call to the research community to address the need for accurate methods to identify cancer-associated mutations from whole-genome sequencing data. Although genomic sequencing of tumor genomes is exploding, the mutations identified in a given genome can differ by up to 50 percent just based on how the data is analyzed.</p>
<p>Research teams were asked to analyze three <i>in silico</i> (computer simulated) tumor samples and publicly share their methods. The 248 separate analyses were contributed by teams around the world and then analyzed and compared by Challenge organizers. When combined, the analyses provide a new ensemble algorithm that outperforms any single algorithm used in genomic data analysis to date.</p>
<p>The authors of the paper also report a computational method, BAMSurgeon (developed by co-lead author Adam Ewing at UC Santa Cruz), capable of producing an accurate simulation of a tumor genome. In contrast to tumor genomes from real tissue samples, the Challenge organizers had complete knowledge of all mutations within the simulated tumor genomes, allowing comprehensive assessment of the mistakes made by all submitted methods, as well as their accuracy in identifying the known mutations.</p>
<p><strong>Dramatic differences</strong></p>
<p>The submitted methods displayed dramatic differences in accuracy, with many achieving less than 80 percent accuracy and some methods achieving above 90 percent. Perhaps more surprisingly, 25 percent of teams were able to improve their performance by at least 20 percent just by optimizing the parameters on their existing algorithms. This suggests that differences in how existing approaches are applied are critically important--perhaps more so than the choice of the method itself.</p>
<p>The group also demonstrated that false positives (mutations that were predicted but didn't actually exist) were not randomly distributed in the genome but instead they were in very specific locations, and, importantly, the errors actually closely resemble mutation patterns previously believed to represent real biological signals.</p>
<p>"Overall these findings demonstrated that the best way to analyze a human genome is to use a pool of multiple algorithms," said co-lead author Kathleen Houlahan, a junior bioinformatician at OICR working with the Challenge lead, Dr. Paul Boutros. "There is a lot of value to be gained in working together. People around the world are already using the tools we've created. These are just the first findings from the Challenge, so there are many more discoveries to share with the research community as we work through the data and analyze the results."</p>
<p><strong>Team sport</strong></p>
<p>"Science is now a team sport. As a research community we're all on the same team against a common opponent," said Dr. Adam Margolin, director of computational biology at OHSU and co-organizer of the challenge. "The only way we'll win is to tackle the biggest, most challenging problems as a global community, and rapidly identify and build on the best innovations that arise from anywhere. All of the top innovators participated in this Challenge, and by working together for a year, I believe we've advanced our state of knowledge far beyond the sum of our isolated efforts."</p>
<p>Dr. Stephen Friend, president of Sage Bionetworks, said the goal is "no longer one of winning the Challenge but instead of constantly addressing an ever-changing horizon. And given the complex heterogeneity of cancer genomes and the rapid rate with which next-generation sequencing technologies keep changing and evolving, this seems like an ideal approach to accelerate progress for the entire field."</p>

<p>Massoud also recently received a Mellon New Directions Fellowship and a fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies. In 2012, he received a Hellman Fellowship given to promising young scholars. Massoud is spending the next academic year at Princeton University&#8217;s Program in Law and Public Affairs.</p>
<p>Originally from Sudan, Massoud studies the institutionalization of law in conflict settings and authoritarian states. His 2013 book, <em><a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/socio-legal-studies/laws-fragile-state-colonial-authoritarian-and-humanitarian-legacies-sudan">Law&#8217;s Fragile State: Colonial, Authoritarian, and Humanitarian Legacies in Sudan</a>,</em> was published by Cambridge University Press and received prizes from the Law and Society Association and the American Political Science Association.</p>
<p>He joined the Santa Cruz faculty in 2009 and holds a law degree and a Ph.D. in jurisprudence and social policy, both from U.C. Berkeley, and a master&#8217;s degree in peace studies from the University of Notre Dame. At UC Santa Cruz, Massoud teaches courses in international law, human rights, and comparative law.</p>
<p>Massoud thanked his colleagues after learning of the award. &#8220;I appreciate the support that each person in the politics department has given me, pushing me to be my best as a scholar, teacher, and colleague. I&#8217;m deeply grateful and humbled," he wrote.</p>
<p>Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of the Social Sciences Division, called the string of awards &#8220;extremely impressive and a testament to Professor Massoud&#8217;s scholarship."</p>
<p>Guggenheim Fellowships are intended for those who have demonstrated exceptional capacity for productive scholarship or exceptional creative ability. This year 173 awards were made to artists and writers, scholars and scientists, from more than 3,100 applicants. Former U.S. Senator Simon Guggenheim and his wife established the awards in 1925 in memory of their oldest son, John Simon Guggenheim, who died at age 17.</p>
<p>The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation&#8217;s New Directions Fellowship supports outstanding faculty members in the social sciences and humanities. Rather than supporting a short-term outcome, such as a book, they are meant as longer-term investments in scholars&#8217; intellectual range and productivity. Massoud's is one of 12 awarded this year and the first for a UC Santa Cruz faculty member.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.gf.org</url><title>John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.mellon.org</url><title>Andrew W.

<p>The event will include presentations by two UC Santa Cruz professors--<b>Daniel Press</b><i> </i><i>("What is Recycling Good For?&#160;The Case of American Paper Today"</i>) and <b>Roger Linington&#8232; </b><i>("Where Do Medicines Come From? In Search of Therapeutics From the World's Oceans"</i>).</p>
<p>It will also feature guest artist-activist <b>Kim Abeles </b><i>(</i><i>&#8232;"<a href="http://frugalworld.org/startPage/start.html">frugalworld.org</a>&#160;and a&#160;galleryofsolutions"</i>) plus film and digital media Ph.D. candidate <b>Anita Chang</b> <i>(&#8232;"A Case Study of the Transmedia Documentary</i> <em>Project </em>"<em>Tongues of Heaven/RootTongue").</em></p>
<p><b>Daniel Press</b> is a professor of environmental studies and executive director of the <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu">Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems</a> at UC Santa Cruz. His research interests include environmental politics and policy, land preservation, water quality regulation and management, industrial ecology, and policy analysis. He is the author of multiple books, including this year&#8217;s <i>American Environmental Policy: The Failures of Compliance, Abatement and Mitigation.</i></p>
<p>Press&#8217;s talk will focus on paper recycling, which in many American communities is usually considered good environmental practice and sound environmental policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, our country treats recycling as waste management, not industrial feedstock,&#8221; notes Press. &#8220;The resulting paper recovery practices are bad for trade, U.S manufacturing and labor, and environmental quality. Shifting from waste management to industrial policy offers ways of making good on the promise of recycling."</p>
<p><b>Roger Linington</b> is an associate professor of biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. His research centers on marine natural products used in biomedical science. Linington&#8217;s research&#160;has two major focuses:&#160;drug discovery for neglected infectious diseases, including malaria, TB and dengue fever, and the use of natural products as probes for biological systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do drugs come from?&#8221; asks Linington. &#8220;In many cases, from the natural world. Research&#160;here at UC Santa Cruz is examining the chemistry of the marine environment as a source&#160;of novel compounds for drug discovery and development. The growing antibiotic crisis threatens a return to the pre-antibiotic era where&#160;even simple bacterial infections often proved deadly.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Linington notes that there has been a&#160;dearth of new antibiotic discovery from nature in recent decades.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our laboratory&#160;is interested in the exploration of niche marine environments for the discovery of&#160;the next generation of antibiotic drugs. This work involved chemists and&#160;microbiologists working in collaboration to develop both new screening platforms&#160;for antibiotic testing, and new molecules discovered from these screens for use&#160;as antibiotic leads.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Kim Abeles</b> is an activist and artist whose installations and community projects cross disciplines and media to explore biography, geography and environment. Her work merges hand-crafted materials with digital representations. Abeles received the 2013 Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship, and is a recipient of fellowships from J. Paul Getty Trust Fund for the Visual Arts, California Community Foundation, and Pollock-Krasner Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Issues like the environmental crisis need the outlandish solutions of art to help shift attitudes and behavior,&#8221; says Abeles. &#8220;My artwork functions at its best when brought directly to specific audiences, sometimes with their trash involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abeles is a 2014-15 Lucas Visual Arts Fellow at the Montalvo Arts Center. She has exhibited in 22 countries, frequently creating artworks site-specific to the location, including large-scale installations for exhibitions in Vietnam, Thailand, Czech Republic, England, China, and South Korea.</p>
<p><b>Anita Chang </b>is an independent filmmaker, educator, and writer. She is also&#160;currently a doctoral candidate in film and digital media at UC Santa Cruz. Her films focus on post-colonialism, ethnography, diaspora, and cross-cultural representation. Chang has taught film in numerous community and academic settings in San Francisco, Nepal and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Chang&#8217;s talk will feature discussion of her project, <i>Tongues of Heaven</i>, an interactive documentary web platform designed to raise awareness about language endangerment and revival through the sharing of personal stories, insights and creative participation.</p>
<p><strong>Admission to the May 19 LASER talk is free.</strong> The presentations begin at 7 p.m. in the Digital Arts Research Center building (DARC--Room 108). For more information, contact the Institute of the Arts and Sciences at <a href="http://ias.ucsc.edu/"><b><i>ias@ucsc.edu</i></b></a>.</p>

developed the Ceph data storage system, has established an endowed chair and provided an additional $2 million for research in open source software</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz alumnus Sage Weil, who developed his computer science Ph.D. thesis project into a highly successful open-source software product (the data storage system <a href="http://ceph.com/">Ceph</a>), has made major gifts to UC Santa Cruz providing a total of $3 million to support research in open-source software.</p>
<p>A $500,000 gift, plus matching funds from the UC Presidential Match for Endowed Chairs, will establish a $1 million endowment at UC Santa Cruz for the <strong>Sage Weil Presidential Chair for Open Source Software</strong>. Additional gifts totaling $2 million will support research in open-source software led by professor of computer science Carlos Maltzahn, who directs the <a href="http://cross.ucsc.edu">Center for Research in Open Source Software</a> (CROSS) at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The purpose of CROSS, Maltzahn said, is to enable more UC Santa Cruz students to do what Weil did and develop their graduate thesis projects or undergraduate senior projects into successful open-source software projects with vibrant user and developer communities.</p>
<p>"CROSS is bridging the gap between student research and open-source software projects," Maltzahn said. "A lot of students build a significant amount of software infrastructure during their thesis research, and these contributions are often lost because there are no resources for students to continue working on their projects after they graduate. The Sage Weil funds allow us to now incubate the most promising prototypes so that all these great student research projects don't get thrown away."</p>
<p>Maltzahn and Scott Brandt, professor of computer science and now vice chancellor for research at UC Santa Cruz, supervised Weil's thesis research. According to Brandt, Weil's experience with Ceph was the inspiration for establishing CROSS.</p>
<p>"Sage did something really pretty extraordinary, and this is a wonderful way for him to help other students potentially achieve what he did," Brandt said. "He kept working on Ceph for seven years after he earned his Ph.D. to take it from a prototype to a usable product. Although CROSS can't fund people for seven years, we hope to enable students to develop things to the point where other people can carry it forward."</p>
<p><strong>Data science, storage, networking</strong></p>
<p>CROSS will support the formation of open source projects, build communities around them, and help with achieving production-level code releases. It will have an Industrial Advisory Board to provide guidance and mentoring and will develop classes on open software systems programming. The center's focus is on projects in data science, data management, storage systems, distributed systems, real-time systems, and networking.</p>
<p>"To our knowledge, CROSS is the first university effort that funds computer science students to make their research prototypes widely available as open-source software," Maltzahn said. "I think it will be a beacon for attracting talented new students to UC Santa Cruz, and we have seen a lot of interest in this idea from people in industry."</p>
<p>Brandt noted that open-source software is increasingly important to industry. "It turns out that many businesses contribute to open-source projects," he said. "In flash storage, for instance, manufacturers keep their hardware details proprietary, but they need a standard interface, so that's an arena where they cooperate through open source."</p>
<p>CROSS aims to integrate the activities of open-source software communities into university research and education. The center uses open-source software projects as a way to share research and talent with industry and government, creating an excellent learning and research environment for undergraduate and graduate students in computer systems.</p>
<p>Weil said his goal in making these gifts to UC Santa Cruz was to promote research in open-source software and the successful transition of academic research into open-source projects and systems.</p>
<p>"We hope to prove out a model that supports academic research and enriches the open source ecosystem in a way that maximizes the value of the investment. If we succeed, we hope to see this replicated in other universities as well," Weil said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Successful entrepreneur</strong></p>
<p>With the help of CROSS, Maltzahn said, UC Santa Cruz hopes to attract more students like Weil. As the founder of web hosting company DreamHost, he was already a successful entrepreneur when he came to UC Santa Cruz in 2004 to study data storage systems. Ceph, initially developed by Weil and other students and faculty in UCSC's <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>, is an open-source, software-defined storage system that runs on commodity hardware. After earning his Ph.D. in computer science in 2007, Weil continued to work on Ceph with a small team at DreamHost, then founded the spin-off Inktank to further develop the platform. Inktank was acquired by open-source software provider Red Hat in 2014 for $175 million.</p>
<p>According to Brandt, Ceph has become increasingly popular in recent years and is now the dominant storage system for the <a href="https://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a> community. And in April 2015, Yahoo <a href="http://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/116391291701/yahoo-cloud-object-store-object-storage-at">announced</a> that Ceph would become the new platform for its well-known exascale photo storage service Flickr and become the foundation of their new Cloud Object Store service.</p>
<p>"Sage was a brilliant student and a serial entrepreneur even before he came here," Brandt said. "It's great to see one of our students succeed in such a visible way, and then for him to give back to us in this way is just extraordinary."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/04/ceph-inktank.html</url><title>Red Hat to acquire Inktank, a cloud storage company with UCSC roots</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/05/3807.html</url><title>New version of Linux OS includes Ceph file system developed at UCSC</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6965d838807270173df02958381d21e8"><name>carter-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New center will bolster support for innovation and entrepreneurship</title><summary>By Sue Carter, Director of the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development — One of the most exciting things about working at a research university is being surrounded by great ideas.

As the founder of four companies, I can attest to the satisfaction of translating ideas into products and services that impact the world.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, we are preparing to launch a bold new suite of programs and educational services to support the entrepreneurial desires of students, faculty, and the greater Santa Cruz community.</p>
<p>Building on the success of the Center for Entrepreneurship in the Baskin School of Engineering, the new Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development (CIED) will support faculty and students who want to take their ideas into the marketplace, whether in the for-profit or nonprofit realm.</p>
<p>The center's mission is tailored to this campus's values and location: It will provide campuswide support for both technological innovation and social enterprise, and it will reach out to and encourage women and underrepresented minorities to bring their ideas to life.</p>
<p>CIED's signature initiatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A proposed Summer Session certificate program for undergraduates, graduate students, and community members. Currently in the planning stages and targeted to begin in 2016, this program would serve up to 20 teams, each made up of students, a faculty or staff member, and a mentor with experience commercializing technology.</li>
<li>A graduate minor for master's and Ph.D. students. Completion of the certificate program and three designated courses in psychology, economics, and technology management would make students across the disciplines eligible for a designated emphasis in innovation and entrepreneurship.</li>
<li>Development of seminars and workshops. A number of workshops offered throughout the year will introduce faculty, staff, and students to grant opportunities, mentors, and other resources needed to transition their ideas into new innovations. A seminar series starting this fall will showcase faculty, students, and alumni with impressive achievements in business creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Housed in the Graduate Division, CIED coordinates with the Office of Research, the Division of Undergraduate Education, and the deans of the five academic divisions. Off-campus collaborators include Bonnie Lipscomb, executive director of the city of Santa Cruz's Economic Development Department, Teresa Thomae of the Small Business Development Center at Cabrillo College, and many members of the local entrepreneurship community, including numerous energetic Silicon Valley veterans who have relocated to Santa Cruz and are focused on revitalizing opportunities on this side of the hill.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley is typically interested in technology start-ups, but CIED will have the capacity to support social enterprise projects, as well. As a global society, we are facing critical needs in renewable energy, water purification, poverty alleviation, and educational equity&#8212;to name just a few.</p>
<p>This campus is home to many great minds filled with wonderful, entrepreneurial ideas but little time or experience to develop them. Graduate students express strong interest in receiving more training in entrepreneurship and nonprofit administration, while undergraduate classes lack the capacity to meet demand.</p>
<p>Businesses launched recently by UCSC affiliates include Two Pore Guys, Dovetail Genomics, Maverix Biomics, and one of my own, Soliculture. Entrepreneurship in the greater Santa Cruz community is exploding, too. This is an opportune moment to expand the reach of successes like Hack UCSC and our campus business plan competitions, enhance our curriculum, and launch new initiatives.</p>
<p>I'll be the first to say it is challenging to balance one's interest in innovation with one's academic career, but the campus is committed to easing the process for those who want to dive in. I've launched companies to develop products that ranged from solar technology to K-12 science education, and I certainly would have appreciated resources like those of the CIED.</p>

No wonder she's the winner of this year&#8217;s Outstanding Staff Award.</p>
<p>The award, presented annually by the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association, recognizes staff members who go "above and beyond" to help students or colleagues, improve programs and contribute to the university&#8217;s intellectual and physical environment.</p>
<p>If she merely had &#8220;off-the-charts organizational skills&#8221; and &#8220;boundless energy, compassion, and follow-through," that would have been enough.</p>
<p>But Baxter&#8217;s colleagues and students also praise her unique ability to inspire future leaders, create a feeling of home and acceptance for undergraduates, work collaboratively, raise thousands of dollars for nonprofits, and create programs to engage young scholars.</p>
<p>"No one is a stranger to Wendy, and everyone is somebody in her eyes,&#8221; writes Jennifer Phan, recent College Nine graduate and former International and Global Perspectives CoCurricular Programs Intern.&#160;</p>
<p>Other staff members will have a chance to congratulate Baxter on the East Field on Thursday, May 28, from 11:30 a.m. &#8211; 1:30 p.m. at the annual Staff Appreciation Picnic, which, in addition to the presentation of the outstanding staff member award, will also feature music, the announcement of the new Staff Advisory Board members, and a raffle.</p>
<p>Baxter directs co-curricular programming, affectionately known as &#8220;The<b> </b>Co-Co,&#8221; at College Nine and College Ten. She&#8217;s held this job since those colleges opened in 2000. Baxter also convened and continues to advise the 12-year-old Practical Activism Conference. A group of students comes together each spring to work for six months developing and planning this day-long student-led program featuring keynote speakers and workshops. The conference started small; in the beginning Baxter said it was little more than a germ of an idea and perhaps a dozen students.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, "it has taken on a life of its own."</p>
<p>The activism conference workshops cover everything from voting injustices to racial profiling and the criminal justice system. Recent workshop topics included&#160; Homelessness in Transgender Communities, and Community Resistance to Racial Profiling</p>
<p>Activist, author, and emeritus professor Angela Davis and feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker have been keynote speakers, among many others.</p>
<p>A sense of family, and practical activism, are closely related values for Baxter at UC Santa Cruz, so it seems fitting that she met her partner, Claire Rubach (College Eight &#8217;84, sociology) in Aptheker&#8217;s upper-division women&#8217;s culture course in the early &#8216;80s.</p>
<p>Baxter said she was &#8220;honored and humbled&#8221; when she heard about the award.</p>
<p>"We value engagement," she said. "We love what we do. I love being in a community, working with young people, and doing collaborative work. And it feels like the Co-Co is one of the places where this happens on campus. It only works because the students are amazing and so committed to doing the work and getting other students on board."</p>
<p>Former Colleges Nine and Ten provost Helen Shapiro credited Baxter for creating and developing the<b> </b>Co-Co in the first place, and, in the process, delivering countless programs, events, staff and student-taught courses that bring to life the colleges' themes of social justice and community, and global and international perspectives. &#160;&#160;</p>
<p>"Wendy has the unusual talent of bringing out the best in her students by believing in them and making them believe in themselves&#8221; wrote Shapiro in her recommendation for Baxter. &#8220;Hundreds of students have now had the good fortune to have had this experience."</p>

<p>Lise Getoor, professor of computer science and associate dean of research at UCSC's <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>, presented her vision for the center--called Data, Discovery, and Decisions (D3)--at the engineering school's <a href="https://datascience.ucsc.edu/spring-afternoon-2015/">Spring Data Science Afternoon</a> on Thursday, May 21. The event brought together participants from industry and academia to discuss the latest developments in data science research.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.glassbeam.com">Glassbeam</a>, a machine data analytics company, is providing initial seed funding of $50,000 to support the creation of the center and intends to become a founding member of the D3 Industrial Advisory Board.</p>
<p>"The gift from Glassbeam gives us some initial resources to help get the center started," Getoor said. "We look forward to recruiting additional founding members and working with our industry partners to develop new models for collaboration between industry and academia in data science."</p>
<p>"We are extremely pleased to help start this new center," said Kumar Malavalli, chairman and chief strategy officer of Glassbeam. "Companies have been collecting their own data for decades but solutions like ours that provide predictive and actionable analysis are only just beginning to come to market. There is so much business value that can come out of proper analysis, that finding additional solutions can't be left to individual businesses alone. It must be the shared responsibility between industry and academia. I have been involved with UC Santa Cruz for over ten years and in 2003 funded the Kumar Malavalli Endowed Chair for Storage Systems Research at the Jack Baskin School of Engineering. I know that UC Santa Cruz has the best platform and resources to drive this industry in new and significant ways."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Neutral platform</strong></p>
<p>According to Getoor, D3's mission will be to develop new computational, mathematical, and statistical research in order to support discovery and decision making from complex, heterogeneous data. The center will serve as a neutral platform for industry and academia collaboration, focusing on common pain points and developing scalable data science templates that can be used for discovery and decision making in a variety of domains.</p>
<p>"The focus will be on the iterative process of going from data to discovery to decisions, which produces additional data that can be fed back into the process. We plan to focus especially on structured and heterogeneous data, such as the data generated by the Internet of Things, or any setting where you want to integrate disparate data from a variety of different sources," Getoor said. "That's very different from the settings that statistics and machine learning have traditionally looked at. We need to develop new mathematical models that are able to deal with not only the scale and computational issues of big data, but also with the heterogeneity of different kinds of data from different sources."</p>
<p>The structure of the center will be modeled after the National Science Foundation's Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers, such as the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/03/storage-systems.html">Center for Research in Storage Systems</a> at UC Santa Cruz. Industry partners will provide input on current industry research needs through participation in research panels, data sharing, and other types of collaboration.&#160;</p>
<p>"It's very timely because there is a need for more collaboration between academia and industry around data science," said Getoor, who organized a panel discussion on the topic as part of the Data Science Afternoon at the Baskin School of Engineering. The panelists include Chaitanya Baru, senior advisor for data science at the National Science Foundation; Internet leader and cybersecurity expert Rod Beckstrom; Glassbeam CEO Puneet Pandit; and representatives from Adobe, Hitachi America, and Looker.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker at the event was Michael Jordan, professor of computer science at UC Berkeley and a leading researcher in statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence. The event also featured a discussion of data science at Netflix with CEO Reed Hastings and Caitlin Smallwood, vice president of science and algorithms.</p>
<p>Getoor said she and her collaborators are looking for additional founding members to kick-start the center.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="738c9185807270173df02958c3f3da92"><name>community-bulletin-burglary</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Crime Bulletin — Car Burglary in North Remote Parking Lot</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is seeking the community's help in finding two suspects who burglarized a car shortly after 3 p.m. on May 20 in the north remote parking lot. &#13;

<p>Born in the Philippines and raised in California, Casel&#160;actually grew up with little knowledge of the popular dance.</p>
<p>But recently, his research took him back to the Philippines to dig into the historical context of the national dance, which originated during the Spanish Colonial occupation of the Philippines that began in the16th century.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a choreographer, I question the most famous and beloved traditional dance, <em>Tinikling</em>, and why it is represented in such a lively and festive way,&#8221; said Casel. &#8220;I argue that during the time it was being created, Filipinos were under Spanish colonial rule&#8211;-a violent past that is not discussed when this dance is presented.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to shed a light on this omission as 'cultural amnesia' to convey an alternative lens through which Filipino bodies can be represented and therefore not easily "exoticized" and easily "consumed" for entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Casel said that he came up with the title of his new work, &#8220;Splinters in Our Ankles,&#8221; to suggest a physical description of the violence perpetrated against Filipinos by the Spanish colonists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rice farmers who did not perform well were said to have been punished by their guards, who made them stand between two bamboo poles where their ankles were slammed,&#8221; Casel noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;By contrast, the <em>Tinikling</em> (whose name is derived from the 'tikling' bird) is a dance where two or more people beat bamboo poles against each other and on the ground to create a rhythmic pattern--while dancers jump through and dance around the poles to avoid being hit. This is meant to represent the farmers trying to catch their worst enemies, the pesky 'tikling'.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Splinters in Our Ankles </i>is a reminder to go deeper, to know more about our history, so as not to be reduced by one example or representation,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><strong>On May 22&#8211;24 and May 28&#8211;31</strong>, Casel will present<b> </b>a preview of the work, an evening-length piece that will have its official premiere at San Francisco&#8217;s ODC Theater in December. Performances take place at the Mainstage Theater, located in the Theater Arts Center on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</p>
<p>The performers will<b> </b>include both student dancers and members of Casel's acclaimed San Francisco-based dance company. <a href="http://www.geraldcasel.com"><em><strong>GERALDCASELDANCE</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t expect to see an actual performance of the Philippine national dance<i>. </i>Casel said that the dancers will instead<i> </i>express their personal histories and identities through performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;People can expect to see a contemporary dance-theater piece with great physicality and rich detail,&#8221; Casel noted. &#8220;They will also hear text written by the performers, some singing, and lots of dancing. (Theater arts professor) Kate Edmunds has created an elegant, minimalist scenic design, and my two musical collaborators, Milwaukee-based Tim Russell and UCSC alumnus Aiden McKee have composed and will play live music.&#8221;</p>
<p>Casel, who joined the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division faculty in 2013, said that he hopes audiences will reflect on their own identities and histories, and continue to ask questions about who they are, what they do, and how their actions affect the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I decided to focus on the Philippine National Dance, because I wanted to know more about my personal history,&#8221; said Casel. &#8220;As a first generation Filipino-American dancer and choreographer, it seemed to be the most appropriate area to generate ideas about a dance. Through my research, I realized how much I did not know about my own culture and Philippine history.&#8221;</p>

<p>Undergraduate research provides students with the opportunities to develop their own ideas, techniques, designs, expressions, leadership styles, analyses, and experiments. These experiences help students explore their interests and career options, enhancing portfolios that can launch careers or serve as stepping stones to graduate school.</p>
<p>As an undergraduate, I spent the summer working on a tough graph-theory problem with a mathematics professor. We never did quite solve the problem, but the work honed my skills in programming and developed my sense of open-ended experimental computing. That exposure to the collaborative nature of working to discover and invent convinced me that academia was the place for me.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, I see students transformed by their research experiences and internships every year. I remember Soraya Danesh, the first and only <a href="http://careers.ucsc.edu/intern/cuip/">Chancellor&#8217;s Undergraduate Intern</a> to work with the fire department. She and her mentor designed her internship, and she promptly developed a passion for emergency preparedness training. That led to a second year with the department, a collaboration with film students to produce <a href="http://emergency.ucsc.edu/public-education/ready-slug/index.html">Ready Slug</a> videos, and ultimately to a master&#8217;s degree in Public Health focused on risk management. &#160;</p>
<p>Another student, Ariel Anders, participated in a summer research program in computer engineering and then joined one of the <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/">Stem Diversity Programs</a> to work in the new area of dental robotics. Today, she is working on her doctorate at MIT, the university tied with UCSC for <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/THE-ranking.html">first in the world in research impact</a>. &#160;</p>
<p>Finally, I remember talking with a student before a Student Union Assembly meeting. He was thrilled to be taking part in one of History Professor Alan Christy&#8217;s projects, because as an undergraduate he was not just learning history, but becoming an actual historian. &#160;</p>
<p>Undergraduate research shapes lives and careers for students from all backgrounds. &#160;Research opportunities and internships provide new experiences and leadership, and they broaden students&#8217; understanding of what is possible in college and beyond. They can help shape career paths, as in Soraya&#8217;s and my case; I am delighted to be in a position today to help increase research opportunities for UCSC students.</p>
<p>By the time they are graduating seniors, 73 percent of our students have taken part in undergraduate research by assisting or participating in research or creative activities under faculty guidance. This is an exceptional level of participation and engagement. As we approach <a href="http://honors.ucsc.edu/saw/">Student Achievement Week</a>, please take the time to congratulate all of this year&#8217;s participants.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, let&#8217;s work together to help every undergraduate realize the full potential of their UCSC education by engaging in research, creative expression, and internships. If you are a continuing student, <a href="https://ugr.ue.ucsc.edu/">ugr.ue.ucsc.edu</a> is a great place to start.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91c8595a807270173df0295829a1d8b4"><name>election-results</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Election Results</title><summary>The results of the Spring 2015 Campus Elections are now available at elections.ucsc.edu</summary><start-date>1432623600000</start-date><display-name>Campus Election Results</display-name><path>/2015/05/election-results</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/election-results</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1432669935915</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1432670251720</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>I am writing to announce that the results of the Spring 2015 Campus Elections are now available at <a href="elections.ucsc.edu">elections.ucsc.edu</a>.&#160;

<p>Shepherd was finance director for the City of Santa Cruz for 13 years and began teaching accounting at UCSC in 1982.&#160;He was involved in planning and developing the Business Management Economics major which has become one of the most popular on campus and has helped hundreds of students go on to successful careers with major accounting firms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The past fifteen years have been the most rewarding period in my teaching career,&#8221; Shepherd said. &#8220;Many of the students like myself,&#160;come from working class families and are often the first member of their family to go to a university.&#160; My emphasis is to prepare students for their future career.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shepherd instructed and mentored more than 18,000 students in economics at UC Santa Cruz alone. He also taught at Cabrillo College and San Jose State University.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob has been instrumental in building our accounting program,&#8221; said Rob Fairlie, chair of the UC Santa Cruz economics department. &#8220;His tireless efforts in teaching, advising, and placing students into top accounting jobs have been remarkable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shepherd is now officially a senior lecturer with security of employment emeritus. He taught what may be his final accounting course in winter quarter but continues to be involved in new student orientations, fall "Meet the Firms" job fairs, alumni events, CalCPA scholarship program, and the new Robert J. Shepherd Economics Accounting Path Scholarship program, founded by his family and open to juniors at UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;I've known Bob for two years now, and I took his last two classes &#8211; intermediate accounting in the fall and winter," said Stevenson senior Michael Kim, who nominated Shepherd for the state CPA award. &#8220;I like his positive, fun-loving personality and his ready sense of humor.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>Kim, who is finishing an economics/mathematics combined major with a concentration in accounting, said Shepherd always made sure students knew about real-world applications of accounting, drawing on his experiences working for Price Waterhouse, the Walt Disney Co., and the city of Santa Cruz, helping recover after the 1989 earthquake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I nominated him in hopes he'd be recognized for all he's done for me and the thousands of students he mentored over the years,&#8221; Kim said.</p>
<p>Shepherd said he is still in contact with many former students and is &#8220;especially elated&#8221; when one calls or writes to say they have passed the difficult national Certified Public Accountant Examination. &#8220;I thrive upon my students' success,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The award will be officially presented at the annual CalCPA Council meeting in June.</p>
<p>Shepherd previously won the UC Santa Cruz Excellence in Teaching Award twice (2001 and 2011); the Universal Design of Instruction Award (2011), issued by the UCSC Disability Resource Center; the Golden Apple Distinguished Teaching Award from the Social Sciences Division (1991); and the Favorite Professor Award (1991 and 1992) from the UCSC Alumni Association.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9bc55e0c807270173df02958a4c7533c"><name>market-cart</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden’s market cart produce stand opens June 2</title><summary>Tuesday, June 2 is opening day for the UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden's Market Cart at the corner of Bay and High streets at the base of the UC Santa Cruz campus.</summary><start-date>1432836000000</start-date><display-name>CASFS market cart</display-name><path>/2015/05/market-cart</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/market-cart</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1432837512169</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1432838071293</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title></title><phone/><email>mtbrown@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/cart_greens-460.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/cart_greens-460.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cart_greens-460.jpg</name><display-name>cart_greens-460.jpg</display-name><file-size>248979</file-size><width>460</width><height>307</height></image><image-alt>farm produce stand</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/cart_greens-80.pg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/cart_greens-80.pg</link><site>news</site><name>cart_greens-80.pg</name><display-name>cart_greens-80.pg</display-name><file-size>33644</file-size></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>farm produce stand</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Fresh, organic greens are among the items for sale at the UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden market cart located at the base of campus.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Tuesday, June 2 is opening day for the UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden's market cart at the corner of Bay and High streets at the base of the UC Santa Cruz campus. The cart will be open Tuesdays and Fridays from 12 noon &#8211; 6 p.m., featuring fresh, organic produce and flowers grown at the campus Farm &amp; Garden.</p>
<p>Opening day shoppers will find a spring selection of colorful crops, including organically grown strawberries, blueberries, salad mix, and romaine, along with bok choy, arugula, and Meyer lemons. Spring flower bouquets will also be available.&#160;</p>
<p>As the growing season progresses, shoppers can look forward to broccoli, potatoes, sweet and hot peppers, apples, pears, sweet corn, tomatoes, basil, summer and winter squash, and much more.</p>
<p>All the produce is organically grown at the UCSC Farm and Alan Chadwick Garden by staff and students in the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, an organic farmer and gardener training program of UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS). Proceeds from sales support the Apprenticeship program, now in its 48th year.</p>
<p>The market cart will be open through the end of October (weather permitting). Shares are also available in the UCSC Farm&#8217;s Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program for the 2015 season.</p>

Kraft, an eminent astronomer and former director of the University of California Observatories and Lick Observatory, died on Tuesday, May 26, at Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz. Kraft, a professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, was 87.</p>
<p>A widely recognized researcher, Kraft was also a gifted administrator who helped guide astronomy into the modern era. He joined the astronomy faculty at UC Santa Cruz and Lick Observatory in 1967. After two appointments as acting director, he was named director of Lick Observatory in 1981 and became director of the newly created UC Observatories in 1988. In that position, he oversaw both Lick Observatory and UC's role in building the state-of-the-art W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.</p>
<p>"Bob Kraft was a major player in a great era for astronomy," said Joseph Miller, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, who served as associate director under Kraft and succeeded him as director of UC Observatories.</p>
<p>Kraft played a key role in bringing about the Keck Observatory, committing the resources of Lick and UC to the construction and instrumentation of the world's first 10-meter telescope, now known as Keck I. Keck I and its twin, Keck II, are among the largest optical and infrared telescopes ever built. UC Observatories, which he directed until 1991, now operates Lick Observatory, manages the Keck Observatory in cooperation with Caltech and NASA, and oversees UC's participation in the Thirty Meter Telescope project.</p>
<p>"Bob created UC Observatories because he realized that we needed a different and more comprehensive organization for UC astronomy with the coming of the Keck," Miller said. "He spent countless hours working with people on other campuses and top UC leadership, gathering support for the new organization and getting it in place."</p>
<p>Kraft also served as president of the American Astronomical Society from 1974 to 1976 and president of the International Astronomical Union from 1997 to 2000.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal, a fellow astronomer, recalled Kraft as "a true scholar with amazing breadth, and a caring and compassionate man who greatly improved the lives of his students, his colleagues, and his family." Blumenthal noted that Kraft "had deep interests and taught courses on wine and music, with a particular passion for Beethoven."</p>
<p>As a researcher, Kraft made important contributions to the understanding of novae, stars that undergo a sudden increase in brightness due to massive nuclear explosions. He showed that all novae arise from close binary star systems in which one star (usually a white dwarf) siphons off hydrogen and helium from its companion, leading to an explosion.</p>
<p>"Between 1962 and 1965, Bob Kraft published a remarkable series of now classic papers, convincingly demonstrating that both the bright classical novae, known from antiquity, and the much fainter dwarf novae, whose studies essentially began in the 19th century, all had one thing in common--they were binary star systems," said his colleague John Faulkner, a professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Kraft also established an important rung on the ladder of celestial distances by assessing the contribution of interstellar dust to the dimming of Cepheid variables in the disk of our galaxy. His work on stellar rotation showed that stars like the sun spin slower and slower as they age because winds of charged particles carry away their angular momentum. He later turned his attention to the chemical composition of stars in the Milky Way.</p>
<p>Kraft was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1971 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1973. In 1995, the American Astronomical Society named Kraft the Henry Norris Russell Lecturer in recognition of lifetime achievement in astronomy. He received the Astronomical Society of the Pacific's highest honor, the Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal, in 2005.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Kraft earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from the University of Washington and a Ph.D. in astronomy from UC Berkeley. He held faculty positions at Indiana University and the University of Chicago in the 1950s, then rose to prominence in the 1960s as an astronomer at the Mt. Wilson and Palomar Observatories in Pasadena. Kraft was married for nearly 60 years to Rosalie Ann Kraft, who died in 2009. He is survived by two sons, Kenneth and Kevin, and a grandson, Cary.</p>
<p>A memorial service will take place on July 18, 2015, at 2 p.m. at the Unitarian Fellowship in Aptos, CA.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/santacruzsentinel/obituary.aspx?n=robert-p-kraft&amp;pid=174967499</url><title>Santa Cruz Sentinel obituary</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a055ec4f807270172b238cce7bc6e39c"><name>guthman-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Julie Guthman wins excellence award for research in food justice issues</title><summary>Julie Guthman, UC Santa Cruz professor of social sciences, whose research looks at agricultural systems, food justice issues, and environmental health, has been selected to receive the 2015 Excellence in Research Award from the Agriculture, Food and Human Values Society.</summary><start-date>1432917000000</start-date><display-name>Julie Guthman Excellence in Research</display-name><path>/2015/05/guthman-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/guthman-award</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1432914095148</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1438029717927</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Community Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/guthman-julie-460.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/guthman-julie-460.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>guthman-julie-460.jpg</name><display-name>guthman-julie-460.jpg</display-name><file-size>121021</file-size><width>460</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt>Julie Guthman</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/guthman-julie-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/guthman-julie-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>guthman-julie-80.jpg</name><display-name>guthman-julie-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>26540</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Julie Guthman</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Professor Julie Guthman's research looks at agricultural systems, food justice issues, and environmental health.

<p>Guthman, author of <em>Agrarian Dreams, the Paradox of Organic Farming in California</em> and <em>Weighing In: Obesity, Food Justice and the Limits of Capitalism,</em> teaches courses on the political economy of food and agriculture, globalization, and food activism.</p>
<p>In announcing the selection, the society&#8217;s president said Guthman&#8217;s &#8220;sustained work in several critical areas has been central, thought-provoking and inspiring to members of the society and far beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p>The award will be presented during the presidential address luncheon at the society&#8217;s annual conference in late June, held this year at Chatham University in Pittsburgh. &#160;The award&#8217;s purpose is to recognize members who have made outstanding research contributions that are important to an aspect of agriculture, food, and human values.</p>
<p>Guthman is also scheduled to present a paper at the conference: &#8220;From Forests to Styrofoam: The Changing Socio-nature of Strawberry Production.&#8221;</p>
<p>The AFHVS was formed in 1987 to promote the study of values issues associated with the production, consumption, and distribution of food, fiber, and natural resources. The society publishes a quarterly journal, <em>Agriculture and Human Values</em>. Guthman has been on the journal&#8217;s editorial board since 2007. Society members come from disciplines that range from agricultural production and the rural social sciences to nutrition policy and the humanities.</p>
<p>The society describes itself as an organization of professionals dedicated to a discussion of the sustainability of modern agricultural practices, about the criteria for judging risks and benefits of chemical and biological technologies, about the poor&#8217;s entitlements to food production in developing countries, and about who will farm in the future and how.</p>
<p>Excellence in research awards are not given out every year. The last winner was in 2012 when Patricia Allen, chair of the food systems and society department at Marylhurst University in Portland, Ore., won.

Press University Librarian Presidential Chair.</strong></p>
<p class="Default">The gift will provide permanent support to the University Librarian for the purpose of archive oversight and maintenance in the UC Santa Cruz Libraries.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/07/cowell-university-library.html"><strong>Elizabeth Cowell</strong></a>, who was named University Librarian last July, was honored as the inaugural appointee to the Presidential Chair at a formal investiture ceremony that took place yesterday on the McHenry Library lawn.</p>
<p>"It is with gratitude that I acknowledge the Webster Family Foundation's recognition of the central role that the University Library plays in the intellectual life of the campus at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Cowell. &#8220;I am honored to be the first&#160;beneficiary of the Richard L. Press University Librarian Presidential Chair endowment."</p>
<p>Increasing support for the Library and endowed chairs are goals of the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=button&amp;utm_campaign=original"><strong><em>Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</em></strong></a>, which to date&#160;has&#160;raised more than $200 million in resources for the campus.</p>
<p>The new Presidential Chair recognizes and celebrates <strong>Richard Press</strong> (father of Daniel Press, professor of environmental studies and executive director of the Center for Agrocecology and Sustainable Food Systems at UC Santa Cruz) and his many decades of contributions to academic libraries and book collecting.</p>
<p>Richard Press&#8217;s work ranges from building library collections on 19th century social movements and revolutions, to his role as one of the great American dealers of fine and scholarly books on the arts, architecture, and Judaica. A great champion, not only of libraries, but also of librarians, Press has nurtured the careers of many staff at private and public universities alike, and also educated and inspired scores of collectors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Richard Press is just a wonderful man who has devoted his life to learning, accessibility, and rare books,&#8221; noted Alec Webster. &#8220;For years now he has been curating his own special collection in his bookstore in Sacramento--not as an investor, rather because he just loves books. This is his life&#8217;s work. It is what he loves doing and what he is deeply passionate about.&#8221;</p>
<p class="Default">&#8220;Richard also knows everything about the UC Santa Cruz Special Collections,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It shows just how passionate he is about the value of a library collection. He helped us see how you can gain a more complete picture of history when you have some of the material pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p class="Default">The Webster Family has had an exceptional impact on the UC Santa Cruz campus, providing gifts to benefit several areas including the Natural Reserves, the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, and the Libraries.</p>
<p class="Default">Alec Webster (&#8217;02, College Eight) came to UC Santa Cruz in 1987 after attending UC Santa Barbara. He worked for the Santa Cruz Institute of Particle Physics as a machinist and lab technician. That experience transformed him into a serious student with a deep interest in food production, forestry, and social justice issues, which led to a B.A. in environmental studies from UC Santa Cruz, with highest honors.</p>
<p class="Default">Alec and his wife Claudia (UC Santa Barbara, &#8217;75, Art) currently serve on the Social Sciences Dean&#8217;s Board of Councilors, and Alec is a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee. He is co-president and secretary of the Helen and Will Webster Foundation, which is dedicated to public education and well-being.</p>
<p class="Default">Alec has also served on the South Campus Vision Council, which ignited his passion for the campus historic district and led to the Helen and Will Webster Foundation providing a gift for renovation and programming for the Cowell Hay Barn at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

Bunnett, a long-time member of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, passed away on May 22. Professor Bunnett was one of the early builders of the department in the late 1960s and 1970s. He helped shape the unique character of undergraduate and graduate education on our campus.</p>
<p>Joe was already an outstanding scientist when he came to UC Santa Cruz in 1966 from Brown University. He continued a distinguished career as one of the most nationally and internationally respected physical organic chemists, making his mark not only in publishing seminal papers in the area of organic reaction mechanisms, but also as an educator and leader. He was a founding editor of one of the top American Chemistry Society journals, <em>Accounts of Chemical Research.</em> His idea that a journal devoted to short, concise, and critical articles offering easy-to-read overviews of basic research in all areas of chemistry would be highly desirable proved to be visionary.</p>
<p>Joe received numerous honors in recognition of his many outstanding contributions to our understanding of chemical reactions. He was a Guggenheim Fellow, a Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and twice a Fulbright Fellow. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was elected Honorary Member of numerous European and South American chemical societies, and he was the recipient of the 1992 James Flack Norris Award in Physical Organic Chemistry and the 1995 University of Rochester Distinguished Scholar Medal.</p>
<p>As an educator, research advisor, and colleague, he had an impact on the careers of many scientists. Professor Claude Bernasconi said, &#8220;I feel a deep gratitude to the man who was such a great mentor during my graduate student years and later such a wonderful colleague at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Bakthan Singaram said, &#8220;It was a joy interacting with Joe, as he possessed immense chemistry knowledge and a great sense of humor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Phil Crews said, &#8220;His rigorous approach to experimental design was evident in lectures and also during visits to his office. A framed needlepoint prominently on the wall near his desk reminded everyone, 'Don&#8217;t make verifiable assumptions!'&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Bunnett was also a strong advocate for undergraduate education and undergraduate research. He established a coveted prize, the Undergraduate Bunnett Research Award, which is awarded to multiple students every year.</p>
<p>After his retirement, Joe continued to be active in the department and in the profession. During the 1990s, he focused a lot of attention on the destruction of chemical weapons. He chaired the IUPAC Committee on Chemical Weapons Destruction Technologies. He served on committees of the National Research Council, Department of Defense, and Organization for the Destruction of Chemical Weapons. He participated in and co-chaired several NATO Advanced Research Workshops concerned with chemical weapons. He continued to participate in departmental activities and attend the weekly seminars. To honor his scientific contributions, the department established in 2001, an annual Bunnett Lecture. Held on the first Friday in May, it features a formal lecture that has been presented by some of the most eminent scholars in the field of chemistry. He regularly attended this event, including the one that took place three weeks before his passing.</p>
<p>A memorial service celebrating Joe&#8217;s long career and accomplishments will take place on Saturday, June 27, at 3 p.m. in the Porter College Dining Hall.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Ilan Benjamin, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a1813d73807270172b238cce841300e8"><name>possible-rally</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Possible rally on Monday, June 1</title><summary>Campus lecturers have announced plans for a "Support UCSC Lecturers" picnic from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. with a rally scheduled for noon to 2 p.m. This is an advisory to be prepared and to stay informed.</summary><start-date>1432882800000</start-date><display-name>Possible rally on Monday, June 1</display-name><path>/2015/05/possible-rally</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/possible-rally</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1432933711187</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1432934154120</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>May 29, 2015</div>

The bloom involves microscopic algae called <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> (a type of diatom), which produce a potent neurotoxin called domoic acid. The toxin was first detected in early May, and by the end of the month researchers had detected some of the highest concentrations of domoic acid ever observed in Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>"It's a pretty massive bloom. The domoic acid levels are extremely high right now in Monterey Bay, and the event is occurring as far north as Washington state. So it appears this will be one of the most toxic and spatially largest events we've had in at least a decade," said Raphael Kudela, professor of ocean sciences and Ida Benson Lynn Chair of Ocean Health at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Periodic blooms of toxin-producing <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> diatoms have been documented for over 25 years in Monterey Bay and elsewhere along the U.S. west coast. During large blooms, the toxin accumulates in shellfish and small fish such as anchovies and sardines that feed on algae, forcing the closure of some fisheries and poisoning marine mammals and birds that feed on contaminated fish.</p>
<p><strong>Warm water</strong></p>
<p>Blooms such as the current event typically last for several weeks to a month. "Often, if we have a big event in the spring, it will go away during the summer and come back in the autumn," Kudela said. "This event may be related to the unusually warm water conditions we've been having, and this year that warm water has spread all along the west coast, from Washington to southern California."</p>
<p>Kudela leads a regional project that brings together researchers from several institutions to monitor study sites in Monterey Bay and southern California. His lab conducts weekly sampling of water and mussels at the Santa Cruz Wharf and works closely with the California Department of Public Health and other organizations. Although <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> blooms often affect wildlife, careful monitoring and fishery closures ensure that commercial seafood remains safe to eat.</p>
<p>During the May 2015 event, researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) measured concentrations of both <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> cells and domoic acid in the bay using robotic instruments called Environmental Sample Processors (ESPs), which are deployed on ocean moorings and can detect algal cells and toxins and send the results back to shore within an hour. Complementing the data from the ESPs, Kudela's lab analyzed water and animals collected from the bay for <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> cells and domoic acid, and UCSC has two robotic gliders collecting data from the surface to a depth of 200 meters in the bay. The University of Southern California also has two robotic vertical profilers, called Wire Walkers, deployed near the ESPs. Researchers from Moss Landing Marine Laboratories helped collect animals and water samples for analysis and are working with UC Santa Cruz researchers to continue monitoring blooms in the bay.</p>
<p>"We have confirmed domoic acid at very high levels in mussels and anchovy," Kudela said. His lab also found very high levels of the toxin in samples from a dead pelican found on the beach in Moss Landing, and testing of sea lion samples is under way. "Domoic acid has clearly worked its way into the food web," he said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Forecasts</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the regional monitoring project, which is funded by NOAA's Ecology and Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms (ECOHAB) Program, Kudela's lab has also been developing predictive models to produce forecasts of where and when blooms of toxic algae will occur. With funding from NASA, the UC Santa Cruz researchers have been working with the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) to run the model and produce forecasts for the entire coast of California. Forecasts are currently available <a href="http://www.cencoos.org/about/news/2014/harmful-algal-bloom-forecasts-now-available">online through CeNCOOS</a>. Over the next three years, Kudela said, his team will be working to hand the model over to NOAA to be run operationally through the National Weather Service supercomputers.</p>
<p>"They'll be coupling it with the weather models to provide forecasts saying what's likely to happen in the next three days," he said. "So far, it's been very good at picking out regional patterns, so we've seen very good correlations with sea lion strandings; but it's less good at pinpointing specific locations."</p>
<p>Clarissa Anderson, who was a postdoctoral researcher in Kudela's lab and is now a research scientist with the UCSC Institute of Marine Sciences, has been leading the work on predictive modeling. When the current domoic acid event began in Monterey Bay in May, the model was also predicting a bloom in coastal waters near Humboldt Bay in Northern California. Anderson, who happened to be up there to give a talk, got local researchers to collect samples for testing, and Kudela's lab was able to confirm the presence of domoic acid.</p>
<p>"We're now developing a model specifically for the shellfish growers in Humboldt Bay," Kudela said. "We know users are paying attention to it. In addition to shellfish growers, the Marine Mammal Center is also using it to keep an eye on spatial patterns and whether toxin levels are going up or down, so they know where and when to expect strandings."</p>
<p>Kudela's collaborators in the ECOHAB program include scientists at MBARI, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, CeNCOOS, UCLA, University of Southern California, Southern California Coastal Water Research Project, Southern California Ocean Observing System, and the U.S. National Centers for Coastal and Ocean Science.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.mbari.org/news/homepage/2015/da-canon/da-canon.html</url><title>MBARI: Unusually high concentrations of toxic algae detected in Monterey Bay</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b537978b807270172b238cce15a0cfd6"><name>biological-clock</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scientists discover a protein that silences the biological clock</title><summary>A protein associated with cancer cells is a powerful suppressor of the clock that drives the daily rhythms of cells throughout the body.</summary><keywords>Carrie Partch, circadian clock, circadian rhythms, cancer/testis antigens</keywords><start-date>1433228400000</start-date><display-name>Scientists discover a protein that silences the biological clock</display-name><path>/2015/05/biological-clock</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/biological-clock</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1433264428902</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1433289359885</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/carrie-partch3-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/carrie-partch3-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>carrie-partch3-400.jpg</name><display-name>carrie-partch3-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>94284</file-size><width>400</width><height>402</height></image><image-alt>Carrie Partch</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/05/images/clock-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/05/images/clock-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>clock-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>clock-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16711</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>clock</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Carrie Partch</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>A protein associated with many kinds of cancer cells was found to suppress the circadian clock, with implications for cancer biology and the workings of the clock itself</article-subhead><article-text><p>A new study led by UC Santa Cruz researchers has found that a protein associated with cancer cells is a powerful suppressor of the biological clock that drives the daily ("circadian") rhythms of cells throughout the body. The discovery, published in the June 4 issue of <em>Molecular Cell</em> (and <a href="http://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/abstract/S1097-2765%2815%2900222-1">online now</a>), adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting a link between cancer and disruption of circadian rhythms, while offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the biological clock.</p>
<p>The ticking of the biological clock drives fluctuations in gene activity and protein levels that give rise to daily cycles in virtually every aspect of physiology in humans and other animals. A master clock in the brain, tuned to the daily cycle of light and dark, sends out signals that synchronize the molecular clocks ticking away in almost every cell and tissue of the body. Disruption of the clock has been associated with a variety of health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.</p>
<p>According to Carrie Partch, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz and corresponding author of the paper, the connection between clock disruption and cancer is still unclear. "The clock is not always disrupted in cancer cells, but studies have shown that disrupting circadian rhythms in mice causes tumors to grow faster, and one of the things the clock does is set restrictions on when cells can divide," she said.</p>
<p><strong>Cancer markers</strong></p>
<p>The new study focused on a protein called PASD1 that Partch's collaborators at the University of Oxford had found was expressed in a broad range of cancer cells, including melanoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer. It belongs to a group of proteins known as "cancer/testis antigens," which are normally expressed in the germ line cells that give rise to sperm and eggs, but are also found in some cancer cells. Cancer researchers have been interested in these proteins as markers for cancer and as potential targets for therapeutic cancer vaccines.</p>
<p>"For very few of these do we understand the roles they might play in driving cancer," Partch said. "Understanding how PASD1 is regulating the circadian clock could open the door to developing new therapies. We could potentially find ways to disrupt it in those cancers in which it is expressed."</p>
<p>Beyond its role in cancer, Partch is also interested in understanding the normal role of PASD1 and why it is silencing the clock in the human germ line. The germ line is the only tissue in the body that researchers have found does not have circadian cycles.</p>
<p><strong>Clock genes</strong></p>
<p>A series of experiments in Partch's lab revealed how the protein interacts with the molecular machinery of the biological clock. There are four main clock genes, and the interactions of these genes and the proteins they encode create a feedback loop that drives molecular oscillations on a 24-hour cycle. Two proteins, CLOCK and BMAL1, form a complex that turns on the <em>Period</em> and <em>Cryptochrome</em> genes. The Period and Cryptochrome proteins then combine to turn off the genes for CLOCK and BMAL1. Partch and her colleagues found that PASD1 is structurally related to CLOCK and interferes with the function of the CLOCK-BMAL1 complex.</p>
<p>"It shuts the clock off very efficiently," Partch said.</p>
<p>The researchers also studied cancer cell lines that express PASD1 and showed that blocking the protein (using RNA interference techniques) turned the clock cycle back on in those cells. Partch's lab is continuing to investigate the biochemical mechanisms involved in the protein's interactions with the molecular clock.</p>
<p>"By understanding what makes the clock tick and how it is regulated, we may be able to identify points where we can intervene pharmacologically to treat disorders in which the clock is disrupted," she said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Clock timing</strong></p>
<p>In another recent paper from Partch's lab, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nsmb.3018.html">published May 11 in <em>Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology</em></a><em>,</em> researchers at UC Santa Cruz and the University of Memphis worked out important details of the interactions between two of the main clock proteins. They found that Cryptochrome interacts with a particular section of BMAL1, and that mutations causing structural changes in that section can alter the timing of the clock, resulting in cycles as short as 19 hours or as long as 26 hours.</p>
<p>"This study answers the longstanding question of how Cryptochrome works, and it's something we think we can drug. If we can control this process with small molecules, we can affect the timing of the clock," Partch said.</p>
<p>Several clock gene mutations have been identified in people with disorders that involve the timing of the biological clock, causing either advanced sleep syndrome or delayed sleep syndrome. There is also a growing body of evidence showing that environmental changes affecting circadian rhythms, including shift work and jet lag, can have profound effects on human physiology and health.</p>
<p>"There are vast consequences to trying to live outside the natural daily cycle," Partch said. "We know that clock disruption in general is not a good thing, and we have ongoing studies to explore its role in cancer and other human health problems."</p>
<p>The first author of the <em>Molecular Cell</em> paper on PASD1 is Alicia Michael, a graduate student in Partch's lab. Other coauthors include Stacy Harvey, Patrick Sammons, and Hema Kopalle at UC Santa Cruz, and Amanda Anderson and Alison Banham at Oxford. This work was supported by grants from the UC Cancer Research Coordinating Committee, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the U.K. Cancer Research Programme, and a Paul &amp; Anne Irwin Cancer Research Award to Alicia Michael.</p>

(Photo by Michael Pratt)</span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dominic Romano (Porter, '15, film and digital media/modern literature) took a creative risk when he undertook a complex project that combined critical writing on Lebanese cinema with images of scars and trauma.</p>
<p>He had no way of knowing how other people would react to &#8220;Bodies of Trauma,&#8221; a written thesis and video that reflects on the personal, cultural, historical, and physical dimensions of trauma--from the Lebanese civil war to situations closer to home.</p>
<p>The response, as it turns out, has been overwhelmingly positive. In a ceremony at the University House, capping off Student Achievement Week from June 1-5, Romano was awarded the 2015 Steck Family Award, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s highest undergraduate honor.</p>
<p>Loren Steck (Porter '73), a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee, chairs the distinguished selection committee. The Steck family created the endowment that funds the award.</p>
<p>As usual, the identity of the Steck honoree was a closely guarded secret right up to the end of the ceremony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having this project acknowledged, and representing the arts, is extremely important to me," Romano said."To have this resonate with other people is very powerful for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>His project took shape in the rigorous "integrated critical practice" track in the film and digital media department. Romano's video, closely linked to the written portion of his thesis, focuses on physical scars and the emotional and psychological traumas they reveal for those who bear them. While his writing critically examined the post-1990 Lebanese film and video scene, the video emerged from interviews with people who&#8217;d suffered from physical scarring.</p>
<p>Romano came to his subject during a course taught by Peter Limbrick, associate professor of film and digital media, who became one of his thesis advisors along with Irene Lusztig, an associate professor in the same department.</p>
<p>Limbrick's class focused on film, video and documentary work from Lebanon and Syria and inspired Romano's project.</p>
<p>"I found the work of these artists to be some of the most poignant, honest, visceral, and human I had ever seen and I immediately fell in love with it," Romano said.</p>
<p>Limbrick takes great pride in the fact that his class was the inspiration for Romano's project.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot is at stake in the conception of critical-creative projects like this one,&#8221; Limbrick said. &#8220;How is he going to tie the written and visual elements together? How will they relate to each other? Rather than take a literal approach and pretend to represent Beirut or Lebanon in his video, (Romano) reflected on what he learned from these filmmakers about the unfinished nature of trauma and the traces it leaves. Remarkably, he managed to conceive these things together before he shot a single frame of the video. It really went hand-in-hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The project&#8217;s themes of trauma and healing were personal for Romano, a friend of McHenry Library staff member Josh Alper, who was killed in 2013 while biking on Highway 1 north of Santa Cruz. Romano worked with him in the Interlibrary Loan office.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would see him every day,&#8221; Romano said. &#8220;We played music together. I&#8217;d never really lost anyone before. It was a big hit for me, and it happened just before I started working on my thesis and taking Prof. Limbrick&#8217;s class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reflecting the ambivalent mood of the Lebanese art and movies he was inspired by, Romano found himself in a middle place, &#8220;grief, and joy, and going on, but also having the past pulling on me.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a265ad348072704638f4f2222f8d7859"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1325408400000</start-date><path>/2015/05/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/05/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1420063780119</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1420063780119</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
