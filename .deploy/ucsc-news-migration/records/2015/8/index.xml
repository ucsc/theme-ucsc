<p>In a world of Snapchat and emojis, the press requires both creativity and exacting patience.</p>
<p>Like other letterpresses, the Cowell Press preserves an art form that is part of Western history and culture. Now it looks like the Cowell Press, which dates to the early 1970s on campus, will inspire students and help artisans make unique books and artworks for many years to come.</p>
<p>Rowland and Patricia Rebele, Santa Cruz-area philanthropists and former newspaper publishers, have come forward with a $500,000 gift to help endow the press.</p>
<p>Patricia Rebele graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1988 with a degree in art history and has a strong interest in arts on campus. Rowland Rebele said the Cowell Press gift is a way of continuing their involvement in fine arts at UC Santa Cruz; previously the couple gave $1 million to help establish the campus's new Institute of the Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>Cowell provost Faye Crosby is thrilled with the news of the gift. She described Cowell Press as a link between the past and the future.</p>
<p>"Think of Steve Jobs and his obsession with fonts," she said. "Think of Gutenberg and moveable type. Now combine those thoughts and you can see why people become addicted to working and playing at a letterpress."</p>
<p><strong>Stepping up for the Press</strong></p>
<p>The Rebele gift has emboldened fundraisers who hope to raise the Cowell Press endowment to $1.5 million to guarantee an annual payout that covers the salary of a print master teaching classes at the press.</p>
<p>Gary Young, distinguished poet and director of the Cowell Press, was present when the Rebeles stepped forward with their pledge.</p>
<p>"In an era that puts a premium on digital media, the Cowell Press offers students an opportunity to work in an age-old tradition: to set type by hand, to pull proof, adjust type, leading, and line, and to proof again until the piece is just right," he said.</p>
<p>Young, a 1973 graduate of UC Santa Cruz, arrived on campus in the late 1960s.</p>
<p>"The campus was rightly famous for innovation and experimentation at that time," he said. "Many of those early educational experiments are now gone, but the Cowell Press has carried on a letterpress tradition.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring opportunity</strong></p>
<p>At the time of the Rebele gift, Michael Williams, a film producer in Los Angeles and a friend of Crosby&#8217;s, had already established the Cowell Press endowment with a $10,000 gift, and with additional help from&#160;&#160;Sean Keilen, provost of Porter College.&#160;Keilen was making sure that Porter students&#8212;even those not majoring in art&#8212;could continue to work and learn at the press.</p>
<p>The first new contribution to the endowment came from alumna Sara Walsh, honoring the memory of her late husband Joe Walsh, who is also a UC Santa Cruz graduate. An additional gift came from alumna S.B. Master, whose company, Master-McNeil, Inc., has established numerous companies and brands, the most famous of which is PayPal.</p>
<p>The press gives students the chance to study and make everything from monoprints to woodcuts and engravings. Many students in a wide variety of majors have been involved with the press; after graduation they have gone on to do graduate studies or professional work in book arts, publishing, and library science.</p>
<p>Cowell College will highlight the work of the Cowell Press this winter with the following events:</p>
<p>&#160;&#8226; The opening reception of the "Pressing On" exhibit on Friday, January 22, 2016, at the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery. All work on display at that show will come from Cowell Press.</p>
<p>&#8226; A panel featuring Gary Young, artist and alumnus Tom Killion, and alumna Felicia Rice, manager for UCSC's Digital Arts and New Media M.F.A. program, followed by a brief open house at the press.</p>

<p>The robot looked like a miniaturized version of a Segway scooter&#8212;but it just wasn't self-balancing like it was supposed to. The robot went "plop" and came to rest on the floor.&#160;</p>
<p>Tackling such problems with sheer ingenuity, creativity, and teamwork is part of the fun at the weeklong Girls In Engineering program at UC Santa Cruz, which introduces girls from as far away as King City in the greater Salinas Valley&#160;to computer science and engineering through a series of hands-on activities.</p>
<p><strong>What is cool</strong></p>
<p>The girls, all of them 8th and 9th graders, use the&#160;programming environment Scratch to make games and animations, and Lego NXT kits to build microprocessor-equipped robots that can perform a wide variety of tasks, from smacking a ping pong ball across the floor to negotiating a tricky obstacle course using sensors. Their week also includes a visit to a local tech company (of which they&#8217;ve visited Cruzio and Plantronics this year), and tours of various Baskin School of Engineering labs, from bioengineering to digital games.&#160;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Professor of Computer Science Charlie McDowell and adjunct Professor of Computer Science Linda Werner were on hand to advise the students.&#160;</p>
<p>McDowell said the camp is designed to open students' eyes to the possibility of tech as a career choice. An important aspect of this program is that most of the instruction and role modeling is done by &#8220;near peers,&#8221; UCSC female undergraduates.&#160;</p>
<p>"This is the age where children make decisions about what is cool and what is not," said Werner, who has done intensive research about computational thinking and middle school-age children. "We lose them unless we can provide them with more opportunities in which to build their confidence, see what is in the future, and have role models."</p>
<p>That's why several undergraduates are always on hand to help them; the idea is that students will look up to them, and perhaps see something of their future selves in those young women. Students also get an immersive sense of what it's like to be on a college campus&#8212;and the place made a big impression. Some girls in the course said they are already hoping to apply to UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</p>
<p>Much of the funding for the Girls in Engineering program comes from the Peggy &amp; Jack Baskin Foundation. Nicole Baran, the foundation's executive director, explained why:&#160;"We launched the Girls in Engineering program at UCSC because we believe it can address the gender gap by bringing more girls into the engineering pipeline at a young age."</p>
<p><strong>Fun atmosphere, serious intent</strong></p>
<p>Everywhere in the classroom, pairs and larger teams of students were huddled together, working on their robots.&#160;</p>
<p>Brigette Cruz, 13, of Salinas, and Alexia Leon, 13, of Castroville, made a robot that senses motion and tries to smack anything that approaches. Cruz and Leon programmed the robot so a scolding message saying "NOT IN MY HOUSE!" appears on a built-in screen if someone rolls a ball at it.&#160;</p>
<p>There was a good deal of hilarity and wonder in the camp that day. Electronic squawks filled the air. A robot dog awaited its master's command. Spare parts were lying in boxes, waiting to be picked up and snapped into place.</p>
<p>But the camp also has a serious intent.&#160;</p>
<p>In a lot of college computer science and engineering classrooms, "you look around and there are a lot more men than women,'' said student instructor Nicole Patterson (Porter '17, Earth sciences).&#160;</p>
<p>"There are lots of male role models, a lot of male speakers who talk about careers in tech," said another student instructor, Rashmi Sehgal (Porter '17, computer science).&#160;</p>
<p>She mentioned the need for more female role models in STEM careers, and the importance of demonstrating the idea that women are very knowledgeable in tech, and enjoy this field of study.&#160;</p>
<p>Sehgal said UC Santa Cruz has programs that encourage women who are interested in fields such as engineering. The campus, for instance, is home to Project AWESOmE, (Advancing Women's Education in the School of Engineering),_ which was set up to identify, encourage, and nurture young women who may be interested in engineering careers.&#160;</p>
<p>The goal of closing the gender gap in STEM fields drives projects such as this summer camp.&#160;</p>
<p>But in the classroom, the spirit was lighthearted. Students were invited to explore their hunches and test out their ideas.&#160;</p>
<p>And once they were done with one impressive project, they lost no time in moving on to the next one. Cruz and Leon, after designing their ping pong-ball smacking robot, got to work on their next big goal: a robot rattlesnake with intimidating jaws and a gaping mouth.&#160;</p>
<p>"It will have ultrasound so if you get too close, it'll snap at you," Leon said.&#160;</p>

<p>The technique, described in a paper published August 3 in <em>Nature Methods</em>, provides sensitive detection of small RNAs that are chemically modified (methylated) after being transcribed from the genome. The researchers used the technique to reveal an abundance of modified fragments derived from transfer RNA molecules in both yeast cells and human cells.</p>
<p>"Transfer RNAs are some of the most numerous small RNAs in all organisms, and it turns out that cells are just littered with little pieces of them. We discovered that many of those pieces are hidden from the standard analyses due to modifications of the RNA," said first author Aaron Cozen, a project scientist in biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Senior author Todd Lowe, professor and chair of biomolecular engineering, said the method opens up a rapidly growing area of RNA research. "With our method, there is a more than three-fold increase in the overall detection of transfer RNA fragments," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer RNA</strong></p>
<p>Transfer RNA was characterized decades ago and plays a well-defined role, together with messenger RNA and ribosomal RNA, in translating the genetic instructions encoded in DNA into proteins. The discovery of RNA interference and genetic regulation by microRNA, however, revolutionized scientists' understanding of RNA's role in gene regulation and other cellular functions. Since then, a bewildering abundance and variety of small RNA molecules has been found in cells, and scientists are still struggling to sort out what they all do.</p>
<p>"In the past five years, we're starting to see that transfer RNAs are not just translating genes into proteins, they are being chopped up into fragments that do other things in the cell," Lowe said. "Just recently, a subset of these fragments was found to suppress breast cancer progression."</p>
<p>Transfer RNA fragments can be detected and analyzed using high-throughput sequencing techniques. But a critical step in the RNA sequencing protocol is blocked by certain RNA modifications involving added methyl groups, and these modifications are prevalent in transfer RNAs. The UC Santa Cruz researchers and their collaborators at the University of Rochester School of Medicine developed an enzymatic method that removes those modifications before sequencing.</p>
<p><strong>Computational analysis</strong></p>
<p>To make the method more powerful, the UCSC team developed a computational analysis of the sequencing data that they could use to identify and map specific modifications and see how common they are. They used this methodology to accurately predict previously documented transfer RNA modification patterns in yeast. Applying the technique to human cells, they were able to document a large number of previously unmapped modifications.</p>
<p>"In the human genome, this particular modification had only been mapped in 10 to 15 percent of transfer RNAs, and with our method were able to map pretty much all of them. It's greatly accelerating the pace of discovery," Lowe said.</p>
<p>Lowe noted that this project capitalized on the expertise at UC Santa Cruz in two major areas, RNA biology and genomics.

Brown Jr. The initiative is being hosted by UC San Francisco, in conjunction with UC Health, which comprises the University of California's five medical centers.</p>
<p>Both projects aim to yield quick results for patients and involve extensive collaborations within the UC system and with other academic medical centers in California, as well as with patient advocates and companies in Silicon Valley and the biotech industry. They were selected by an expert review panel from a highly competitive group of proposals submitted by collaborative teams around the state.</p>
<p>Scientists at UC Santa Cruz will harness big data bioinformatics to help doctors identify effective treatments for California children with cancer who fail to respond to standard therapies. The other winning proposal, led by UCSF, will enable detection of all known pathogens with a single DNA sequencing test, to diagnose acute infections in hospitalized patients.</p>
<p><strong>Exciting new tools</strong></p>
<p>"Both of these projects are developing exciting new tools that promise to deliver precision medicine tests and therapies to patients within a very short timeframe, as quickly as 18 months to two years," said Atul Butte, MD, PhD, who directs UCSF's Institute for Computational Health Sciences and is heading the precision medicine initiative. "We hope the success of these first two projects will inspire others to support this initiative, so we can fund additional promising precision medicine projects to help patients."</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and scientific director of the Genomics Institute, and research associate Theodore Goldstein, a former Apple vice president, will lead the development of a secure Internet-based networking system to match cancer therapies to individual children based on the genetic characteristics of their tumors. The California Kids Cancer Comparison will enable clinicians to sort through a much larger pool of genetic data than has previously been available, including tumor sequencing data from children throughout California and around the world, as well adults. And it will enable patients, their advocates, clinicians and researchers to upload, analyze and communicate genomic information and associated data through MedBook, a social media platform developed by Goldstein that maintains privacy and security for patients' data.</p>
<p>"Our goal is simple: Every kid in California with cancer who needs a second chance, should get a second chance," Haussler said. "Currently, too many kids are not getting the full advantage of complete genomic analysis. If the standard treatment does not cure a child with cancer, then we need to be doing all that we possibly can to use genomic analysis to come up with an alternate therapy."</p>
<p>The project includes investigators from UC Irvine, UCSF and Stanford University, as well as the University of Southern California, the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (including UCLA and UC San Diego), UC Davis, Hyundai Cancer Institute at Children's Hospital of Orange County, Children's Hospital Philadelphia and the Translational Genomics Research Institute.</p>
<p>The team includes such industry partners as NuMedii, Cisco, and DNAnexus. And it builds on the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://treehouse.soe.ucsc.edu/">Treehouse Childhood Cancer Project</a>, which enables combined analysis of adult and pediatric cancer genomic data sets, including those generated by the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s tumor genomics initiatives, as well as pediatric clinical sequencing trials.</p>
<p>The effort requires collaboration between patients, families, clinicians, advocates, researchers and entrepreneurs, and the team has enlisted support from Unravel Pediatric Cancer, Jacob's Heart, and Kids v Cancer.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Infectious diseases</strong></p>
<p>The second winning proposal was from a team led by Charles Chiu, MD, PhD, an associate professor of laboratory medicine at UCSF. It aims to use genetic sequencing to diagnose patients who are hospitalized with acute, potentially life-threatening infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Chiu's team includes investigators from UCSF, UC Davis, UC Berkeley and UCLA, and from such private companies as Syapse, DNAnexus, Quest Diagnostics and Google Genomics. The team hopes to make the test available to hospitals around the state and, eventually, the country.</p>
<p>The California Initiative to Advance Precision Medicine, announced in April, is an important step toward enabling the state&#8217;s scientists to study any disease and even the health care system itself, using data from across the UC health care system and other academic medical centers and health care providers throughout California. The goal is to integrate clinical data with genomic, environmental, socioeconomic, mobile and other data from patients so scientists can determine disease mechanisms and develop precise therapies.</p>
<p>UC San Francisco is hosting the two-year initiative through UC Health with $3 million in startup funds from the state; $2.4 million of this, divided evenly between the two proposals, is funding the demonstration projects. The public-private initiative aims to leverage these funds with contributions from other academic and industry partners.</p>
<p>The initiative will also inventory the public and private precision medicine assets in the state, and convene experts in medicine, technology, privacy, bioethics and intellectual property to help ensure the secure, fair and respectful exchange of data and knowledge.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f96b16d3807270171b1d4390bbe8a8ae"><name>madau-pascal-chair</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astrophysicist Piero Madau awarded prestigious international research chair </title><summary>Piero Madau, distinguished professor of astronomy and astrophysics, has been appointed to an International Blaise Pascal Research Chair.</summary><keywords>Piero Madau, Blaise Pascal Research Chair</keywords><start-date>1438671600000</start-date><display-name>Astrophysicist Piero Madau awarded prestigious international research chair </display-name><path>/2015/08/madau-pascal-chair</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/madau-pascal-chair</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1438703621818</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1438711807206</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/piero-madau-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/piero-madau-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>piero-madau-300.jpg</name><display-name>piero-madau-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>51307</file-size><width>300</width><height>362</height></image><image-alt>Piero Madau</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/piero-madau-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/piero-madau-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>piero-madau-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>piero-madau-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17354</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Piero Madau</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Piero Madau</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The government of the greater Paris region has appointed Piero Madau, distinguished professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, to an <a href="http://www.chaires-blaise-pascal.ens.fr/laureats-2014/laureats-2015/article/piero-madau?lang=fr">International Blaise Pascal Research Chair</a>. The Pascal chairs are awarded annually to preeminent, internationally acclaimed scholars in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities to conduct research and deliver public lectures in the Paris region.</p>
<p>Named after the eminent 17th-century French mathematician, physicist and philosopher, the Blaise Pascal Chairs are administered by the Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS-Paris), France's most prestigious institution for the training of academics. Each chair holder's research project is sponsored by a Parisian academic institution; in Professor Madau's case it will be the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris at the University Pierre et Marie Curie.</p>
<p>Madau is only the fourth astrophysicist to be appointed since these chairs were established in 1996. Previous laureates include Gerard Debreu (1983 Nobel Prize in Economics), Ahmed Zewail (1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry), George Smoot (2006 Nobel Prize in Physics), Elizabeth Blackburn (2009 Nobel Prize in Medicine), and Michael Levitt (2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry).</p>
<p>Madau was honored for his fundamental contributions to understanding the era of first light in the universe, the physics of the intergalactic medium, and the formation and evolution of galaxies. He will divide his time between Paris and Santa Cruz over the next two years, maintaining his teaching responsibilities at UC Santa Cruz throughout the term of his honorary designation. The Blaise Pascal Chair will enable Madau to continue his research project in computational astrophysics, "Connecting the Dark and Light Side of Galaxy Formation." This research is aimed at testing the nature of dark matter, an as yet undetected elementary particle that is weakly interacting and emits no light, and whose gravitational pull holds together galaxies such as our own Milky Way and clusters of galaxies.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fa48cea8807270171b1d439052b367f8"><name>tilly-shaw-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Priscilla (Tilly) Washburn Shaw  (1930-2015)</title><summary>Priscilla (Tilly) Washburn Shaw </summary><keywords>Priscilla (Tilly) Shaw </keywords><start-date>1438719000000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: Priscilla (Tilly) Washburn Shaw  (1930-2015)</display-name><path>/2015/08/tilly-shaw-memoriam</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/tilly-shaw-memoriam</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1438718152327</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1438719629187</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/tilly-shaw-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/tilly-shaw-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tilly-shaw-250.jpg</name><display-name>tilly-shaw-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>116461</file-size><width>250</width><height>334</height></image><image-alt>Priscilla (Tilly) Washburn Shaw</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/tilly-shaw-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/tilly-shaw-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tilly-shaw-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>tilly-shaw-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26653</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Priscilla (Tilly) Washburn Shaw, born in Massachusetts, September 25, 1930, died peacefully at her home in Santa Cruz surrounded by her friends, July 21, 2015.</p>
<p>A literary scholar, poet, and UC Santa Cruz faculty member in Literature from 1966 to 1993, Tilly Shaw arrived with the opening of Stevenson College in 1966-67, as a visiting faculty member from Yale. She was hired by the Board of Studies in Literature in 1967, one of few tenured women in UCSC&#8217;s early days and the only tenured woman in literature.</p>
<p>In addition to her published work on Valery, Yeats, and Rilke, she developed a specialist interest in Conrad and Lawrence in the &#8216;70s and Levertov, Plath, Sexton, and especially Adrienne Rich in the &#8216;80s. She particularly loved the stimulating interdisciplinary atmosphere of those early days at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>One of the first among her peers at UCSC to become interested in feminist studies and women&#8217;s writing, she determined to teach half her classes on women authors every year from the &#8216;80s on. She brought her gifts for close reading&#8212; of people as well as texts&#8212;and for listening, to her students and to those she counseled for years in Santa Cruz&#8217; Co-Counseling program.</p>
<p>A celebration of her life is being planned for late September. Donations in her name to Poetry Santa Cruz are most appreciated.</p>

A way to sharpen hearing aids by decoding the neural chatterings in zebra finch brains. The life, and painful death, of a condor named Ventana. These are among the offerings in <a href="http://sciencenotes.ucsc.edu/2015"><em>Science Notes 2015</em></a>, the annual multimedia magazine published by the UC Santa Cruz Science Communication Program.</p>
<p>The program's newest graduates welcome readers to dive into their features and multimedia packages. You'll read about the meanings of "clap-threat calls" by elephant seals, and you'll hear them in the podcast, too. A video describes climate change impacts on species across California, within a story about the margins of extinction for lizards and red-legged frogs. A state-by-state infographic traces West Nile virus infections, which the author follows from mosquitoes in Central Valley marshes to us -- by way of crows and robins.</p>
<p>You'll also see, smell, and feel the mystery of sea star wasting syndrome, join stroke survivors in a trial of virtual game-based movement therapy, and understand how our antiquated electrical grid isn't prepared for the solar panels popping up on your neighbors' roofs.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz faculty and researchers featured in the stories include biologists Barry Sinervo, Colleen Reichmuth, Caroline Casey, Marm Kilpatrick, and Peter Raimondi; computer engineers Luke Buschman, Sri Kurniawan, and Patrick Mantey; electrical engineer Joel Kubby; and environmental toxicologists Myra Finkelstein and Donald Smith.</p>
<p>As ever, <em>Science Notes 2015</em> was a team effort, with illustrations provided by students in the Science Illustration Program at CSU Monterey Bay guided by director Ann Caudle and her lecturers.

<p>During an informal Skype session with UC Santa Cruz Review magazine, Waters spoke candidly about everything from affordable high-quality food to the essential role of young people in America's "Delicious Revolution" and the need for vigilance when checking food labels at grocery stores.</p>
<p>&#160;Waters was in Rome at the time of the interview, working on a food-related project at the American Academy, a foundation for arts and scholars started at the turn of the last century.&#160;Waters will receive the Foundation Medal at the UC Santa Cruz's Founders Celebration Fiat Fifty dinner on September 26, 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Dan White</strong>: What was your starting point, your first inkling that food was going to be the focus of your life?</p>
<p><strong>Alice Waters</strong>: For me, it was taste. Taste! When the food is really tasty, everybody wants to stay at the table. My parents had a garden. I know I ate strawberries out of the garden. I know they made rhubarb compote, corn on the cob, and tomato salad. Those are early things, but I never loved food until I went to France. There was a meal there (that changed my life)&#8212;I wrote about that in my first cookbook, but there were little things, too, like a hot baguette and apricot jam and eating in a certain way, eating as a kind of ritual. It felt like food was about care and conversation and a lot of other things. After I got back from France, I felt like I knew how to cook. I was just lucky that I went to France when it was a Slow Food culture.</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> How would you define Slow Food culture?</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: There is a set of values and practices that are based on a traditional way of eating and producing food and cooking that comes really since the beginning of civilization, where you buy what is local, you eat what is in season, where you take care of the land, and you eat with family and friends. You celebrate events of one's life together. You think of food as precious. There are values that have had the test of time. When I was in France (studying abroad, in 1965), parents brought their kids home from school and fed them at home for two hours and went to the market twice a day, and they ate together both at lunch and at dinner. People went out to restaurants in Paris from their offices together; it was just a very different world. And it is only since really the '50s where people have started the whole industrial system to make money. I mean, food is not a commodity. Food is something really precious and we need to use it all, and this culture wants us to waste it so that we buy more. It &#8230; is really hard for children to get out of it, or even parents. It is addictive because it is full of sugar and salt.</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> A few years after that life-changing Paris trip, you started Chez Panisse in 1971 in Berkeley&#8212;the same year the UCSC farm was founded. Do you see a similar trajectory&#8212;a food movement that started out below the radar, almost as an underground phenomenon, and became much more mainstream?</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> Without any question. I think it started out as a countercultural movement. Chez Panisse was empowered by that whole era of the '60s when you felt like whatever you did, there would be people that would come, and we stopped the war in Vietnam. We really had some sense of an idealistic world that we could create, and certainly farming was a big part of that. I was connected to Green Gulch Farm (outside San Francisco), and when Alan Chadwick, (early visionary of the sustainable food program at UC Santa Cruz) was dying there I went to see him. Definitely we are in the same movement, which is back-to-nature. I think that we (at Chez Panisse) were really involved in Diet for a Small Planet in the '60s and there was a lot of sort of dropping out and growing your own and not buying commercial food. I felt like that was a whole part of the hippie culture.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: And you've had quite a few CASFS (UCSC's Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems) apprentice graduates work for you at Chez Panisse.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: Many. And many in the Edible Schoolyard Project (in Berkeley) because Santa Cruz has the program that really trains people in farming in a very particular way so they could come and immediately become a teacher for young students. I have been back to Santa Cruz to see the Homeless Garden Project a couple of years ago&#8212;an amazing project, probably the most important project around homelessness, the only one I knew about in the world that really rehabilitates, and I know it has a tremendous amount to do with the (UC Santa Cruz) students who volunteer to help that project.</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> Why do you think it is important for students to go through farm-apprenticeship programs, and how is it different to be a small, organic farmer now compared to when you were starting out with Chez Panisse?</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> That is a really good question because young people are redefining what it means to be a farmer and they are bringing us out to the country. They are showing us the culture of agriculture. That is a beautiful thing. The organic farmers of the '60s, if they weren't on a commune, they were mom-and-pop operations. It was really hard work that was pretty solitary and difficult. We've never elevated the farmer in this country. We've just taken them for granted the same way we've taken our teachers for granted. I really think this whole movement could lift up the farmer and the teacher&#8212;just lift them both up as the most important jobs of this country.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: But isn't some of that lifting happening right now with the sourcing blackboards at the restaurants, listing the farmers that grew the spinach, the potatoes, the Swiss chard?</p>
<p>&#160;<strong>AW:</strong>&#160; That is a beginning but it really has to go into the public school system. We have to learn about farming when we are 5, not when we are graduates. We have to learn about it when we're little. This is the great part; we have this inside us. It is in our DNA that we love nature. She's our mother, she feeds us, and when children have been deprived of going out and running after school and are on their computer and iPhones and have never been connected (with nature), it may take a week or two, but it doesn't take very long before they want to be outside. They love it, and when they grow something and cook it themselves, they all want to eat it. It's like falling in love . &#8230;. It's something we're wired for.</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> It seems like nowadays every small restaurant is listing the farms that sourced its produce and meat. Have we reached a point where the sourcing lists become too much, where the value gets diluted because everyone's doing it?</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> I don't think so. Right now there is too much other sort of propaganda out there. We need to really know where our food comes from and to be able to support the people who are doing the right things. When you list the farms you are buying from, you are telling people that they can trust you and you can go out to those farms and you can see what is happening. We are trying to demystify (the sourcing) and inform people.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: You have such a strong critical stance about fast food that I'm almost afraid to ask about this. But I hear you ate at a McDonald's once.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: I did it as an experiment. I was stranded in Salina, Kansas. I was on the way to The Land Institute (a 28-acre sustainable agriculture and research center in Salina), and I just thought I should just go in there and see how long it takes me to eat and see what it's about.</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> Do you remember what you ordered?</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: The usual. A hamburger and French fries. I ate it in about five minutes. I just felt that it didn't have a lot of flavor. A lot of salt and sweet but not a lot of flavor at all, just texture.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Fast-food restaurants emphasize convenience, but they also emphasize low cost. You once said that you felt food should cost more.</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> I did. You can't possibly have cheap food. I mean, maybe if it is in season and the farmer wants to get rid of it and you are buying it straight (from the farmer), but when it's cheap, somebody is missing out, and 9 out of 10 times it's the farmer. I want to eliminate the middleman and buy directly from the farmer and then the food can be affordable, but we can never think of something as being cheap. If it is cheap, it's made by people who I think are being taken advantage of in everything, not only food.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Speaking of McDonald's and other convenience foods, do you feel you've put a dent in the "Fast Food Nation" since you started out?</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> I think there is a lot of hijacking going on right now. All the terms of our movement are being (appropriated&#8230;. They had a McDonald's restaurant boldly at the sustainable expo in Milan. It is unbelievable. They pay a certain amount to get in there. I guess people wanted the money and they took it. (Waters was referring to the presence of McDonald's at Expo 2015 in Milan, Italy. That year, the expo's chosen theme was "Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life." The expo attracted food-related businesses from across the globe to discuss food innovation, sustainability, and other issues.) It is shocking how deceptive the campaigns are&#8212;how they put in one thing that's organic in a store and you get the impression that everything is, when in fact it's only the one thing. It's all of them &#8230; I feel that the deception is there. It is not about honesty and integrity, it's more important they sell than to inform people what is in food. We need to know what "grass fed" means, what "pasture-raised" means, because they are all using all the images to give you the sense that they are picking it up at the farm that day.</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> There has been a lot of discussion about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) lately. Lots of chefs in the Slow Food movement have come out against them, including you. If someone could prove scientifically that GMO foods are not bad for you, would you have a different opinion about them?</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> No. I really think some things are really too complex to evaluate what is happening inside our bodies. I just know that so many things that are happening to us whether it is cancer or allergies. &#8230; I think we have to just be in rhythm with the natural world.</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> Because of your stature, you now have an international platform for your ideas about food and food systems. Did you ever expect starting out to have this level of influence about these issues?</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> Never! I didn't. Never. What I am saying is basically common sense. That's all it is. If am considered completely unusual, and people are listening, (that also means) the food fast food culture has changed the way people think.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> And you've also been very outspoken lately about food labeling and the need for consumer vigilance.</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: It is something serious. You have to ask&#160; every imaginable question, and those people selling it in the store don't have the answers for you. You have to eat with intention and buy with intention.</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> But in some sense, those appropriations you are talking about&#8212;non-sustainable food producers using the language, the terminology of Slow Food&#8212;isn't that a kind of backhanded compliment to the people, including you, who have pushed Slow Food values into the mainstream?</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> You know, you're right. You're right that they see something happening and they want to get a piece of it. They are aware of that so they are using that. They got on gluten free and now they are advertising it and making people feel that that is the problem they have when in fact it could very easily be that the wheat we are making bread out of and everything else has been contaminated.</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> Are you suspicious of food trends that explode for a while such as concerns about carbs?</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> (Laughs) Yes. And cholesterol. And it just goes on.</p>
<p><strong>DW</strong>: Do you have a hopeful outlook about the work that you and like-minded people have been doing? Do&#160; you feel you've made a lasting impact?</p>
<p><strong>AW</strong>: I'm very hopeful. I am in contact with so many young people. I just know from the 8th graders at the middle school in Berkeley (where her garden project takes place) that any of them could give a TED Talk on sustainability. They're connected globally. They know what is happening to this world. They feel an urgency to be part the solution.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0a84e43e807270171b1d43909504971a"><name>navarro-hector</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Doing something significant with my life'</title><summary>Molecular, cell and developmental biology student Hector Navarro, who came from humble beginnings, now works in a genetics lab on campus with the goal of becoming a cancer researcher.</summary><keywords>Hector Navarro, Bill Sullivan, molecular, cell and developmental biology, cancer researcher </keywords><start-date>1438930800000</start-date><display-name>'Doing something significant with my life'</display-name><path>/2015/08/navarro-hector</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/navarro-hector</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1438990525458</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1440182250784</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/navarro-hector-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/navarro-hector-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>navarro-hector-300.jpg</name><display-name>navarro-hector-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>145631</file-size><width>300</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt>Hector Navarro, a 19-year-old Cowell College student majoring in molecular, cell and devel</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/navarro-hector-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/navarro-hector-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>navarro-hector-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>navarro-hector-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27189</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Hector Navarro, a 19-year-old Cowell College student majoring in molecular, cell and devel</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Hector Navarro, a 19-year-old Cowell College student majoring in molecular, cell and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz, is working in a genetics lab on campus with the goal of becoming a cancer researcher some day.

<p>Navarro would watch and think he&#8217;d never met a man who worked harder than his father. He&#8217;d think how proud he was of the way his dad had become a citizen and left the strawberry fields for a job that allowed his wife to raise their family of six &#8212; a simple but good life.</p>
<p>Navarro didn&#8217;t expect much more out of his own future. &#8220;I grew up thinking, &#8216;I come from humble roots so my life could quite possibly end up the same way,&#8217;&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Then, Navarro found science.</p>
<p>Today, the 19-year-old Cowell College student is majoring in molecular, cell and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz and is working in a genetics lab on campus with the goal of becoming a cancer researcher some day.</p>
<p>Navarro says even though his dad doesn&#8217;t completely understand the research he is doing on the mechanisms that drive cell division, his father is proud. &#8220;He always wears a UCSC sweatshirt,&#8221; Navarro says with a grin. &#8220;That&#8217;s so he can say: &#8216;Yeah, my son is a scientist there.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Navarro has dark hair, a quick smile, and a friendly manner. So it wasn&#8217;t unusual that he would ask questions when he discovered in high school that, not only was there a UC campus a few miles from his house, but also that a UC Santa Cruz professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology lived next door to a friend. &#160;</p>
<p>The answers Professor Bill Sullivan gave fascinated Navarro. Not understanding the university system, Navarro eagerly suggested to the geneticist that maybe he could &#8220;help out&#8221; at the lab when he was in college.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was just a really pleasant guy. I told him &#8216;sure,&#8217;&#8221; remembers Sullivan. &#8220;Like a lot of students, research is completely foreign to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Navarro didn&#8217;t forget the conversation and emailed Sullivan after his first year on campus. He applied for a position in Sullivan&#8217;s lab, interviewed, and won a spot.</p>
<p>Today Navarro, who plans to graduate in 2017, is helping work on research into the mechanisms that govern cell division, including those that are often associated with many types of cancers in humans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hector has that maturity,&#8221; says Sullivan of Navarro&#8217;s work ethic in the lab. He described the undergraduate as responsible, sincere, and appreciative of the opportunities he has received.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you reach a certain age, you have to take a lot of factors into consideration when you choose a career,&#8221; Navarro says. &#8220;Income is one of the big ones. But I came from a really humble beginning so I don&#8217;t really care that much about being rich. I care more about doing something significant with my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>For him, that &#8220;something significant&#8221; is doing cancer research.</p>
<p>It was a decision encouraged by his mother, who always urged him to do something noble with his life. His professors at UC Santa Cruz were an influence as well, including Professor of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology Michael Rexach, who would often meet Navarro outside of class to share real stories about the scientific process and the characters involved &#8212; giving Navarro insight into the life of a researcher.</p>
<p>Navarro also credits Chancellor George Blumenthal and administrators for opening the door for people like himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s really incredible how the university&#8217;s main goal is to give students like me these opportunities to be able to succeed,&#8221; Navarro says. &#8220;It&#8217;s not something I thought was possible. People from working-class families just don&#8217;t end up doing cancer research.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/06/sleuthing-killer-shrub.html</url><title>Sleuthing a killer shrub</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/06/mehic-sanjin.html</url><title>Undergrads experience the rewards of research</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/07/ashley-guinevere.html</url><title>Summertime, and the research is happening</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1df60b7e8072701754c86745ae5290e9"><name>diversity-inclusion-certificate-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Save the Date: 2015-2016 Diversity and Inclusion Certificate Program</title><summary>The Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI) is excited to announce the course schedule for the 2015-16 ODEI Diversity and Inclusion Certificate Program.</summary><start-date>1439190000000</start-date><display-name>Save the Date: 2015-2016 Diversity and Inclusion Certificate Program</display-name><path>/2015/08/diversity-inclusion-certificate-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/diversity-inclusion-certificate-program</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1439316708185</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1439316708185</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Mark your calendars: Registration begins Tuesday, September 1 at 8:00 am<br/>

The Program is designed to offer participants an in-depth examination of diversity and differences in order to gain a greater understanding of how we can and why we should work together to build a stronger and more inclusive UC Santa Cruz community. The Program provides a valuable professional development opportunity at no cost to employees or employee units.&#160; The courses range from two to three hours and will be taught by various internal and external instructors in different formats. The core courses are offered twice during the academic year while the elective courses are offered once. Since the program began in 2010, we have had 219 graduates. We continue to receive positive feedback about this program that strives to promote diversity and inclusion on campus.<br/>
<br/>
 For new registrants who are pursuing a certificate, the program requires a completion of nine courses (seven required core courses and two electives of your choice).&#160; Participants who complete all nine courses within two academic years qualify to receive a certificate of completion. Individual courses are also open to those who are not pursuing a certificate; individuals have the option to take courses based on their own interest. Due to the popularity and high demand for this program, we have initiated <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/training/certificate_courses.html">new program guidelines</a> regarding cancellations and no shows.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 We are very pleased to announce that this year we are offering two new classes on race that will be taught by two of our distinguished faculty members. Associate Professor Alice Yang is teaching a core course, &#8220;Race in America,&#8221; and Assistant Professor Christopher Chen is teaching an elective course, &#8220;Race: A Brief History of an Idea.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Note:</strong> If you completed the previous core class on race, &#8220;Understanding Race, Ethnicity, and National Origin,&#8221; it satisfies the same requirement taught by Associate Professor Yang this year. Please do not sign up for the new &#8220;Race in America&#8221; class if you already satisfied that core requirement in order to open space for those who need that class.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Mark your calendars</strong>: Registration begins September 1, 2015 at 8:00 am. Please plan accordingly if you are out of the office because classes fill up quickly. (Class size is limited.) Our courses for this academic year officially begin on October 6, 2015.

These battles are relatively rare, however, and a new study shows that the males avoid costly fights by learning the distinctive vocal calls of their rivals. When they recognize the call of another male, they know whether to attack or flee depending on the challenger's status in the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p>Researchers from UC Santa Cruz have been studying the behavior of northern elephant seals at A&#241;o Nuevo State Reserve since the late 1960s. The new findings, <a href="http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/2/8/150228">published August 12 in the journal <em>Royal Society Open Science</em></a><em>,</em> come from a long-term study led by graduate student Caroline Casey and research biologist Colleen Reichmuth in collaboration with French experts in bioacoustics and animal signaling systems.</p>
<p>"Anybody who's studied elephant seals knows that their vocal communications are important, but we haven't known what information is encoded in the vocalizations," Casey said. "What we found is that these calls are identity signals. Each male has a unique call, and they learn to recognize the calls of their competitors, so they know how to respond during contests."</p>
<p>During the breeding season, the beaches at A&#241;o Nuevo are crowded and noisy. Males establish their social status initially through physical confrontations, but most of the interactions between males consist of ritualized displays involving loud vocalizations called "clap threats," as well as physical posturing (usually rearing up to show an elevated profile). Sometimes they slam their chests onto the sand to send a seismic signal. High-ranking "alpha" males defend their harems from all challengers, while mid-ranking "beta" males respond to rivals according to their relative social status.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Social network</strong></p>
<p>"There is a very structured social network among the males in a given location. Although the rate of conflict between males is very high, the rate of actual physical aggression is very low--only about 5 percent of interactions lead to physical contact," said Reichmuth, director of the <a href="http://pinnipedlab.ucsc.edu/">Pinniped Cognition &amp; Sensory Systems Laboratory</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The researchers recorded the calls made by male elephant seals during challenge displays directed at other males. Then they used acoustic analysis and playback experiments to figure out what is being communicated in those exchanges. They found that males responded aggressively to the calls of subordinate males, but when presented with the call of a dominant rival, they moved quickly away without calling.</p>
<p>Males of many species use specialized signals to assess their opponents, and these are often so-called "honest signals" that directly convey information about an individual's size and strength or willingness to fight. For example, a large male might have a louder or longer call than a smaller male. In elephant seals, however, the researchers found that even though some features of the males' calls are associated with size, those features don't predict how competitors will respond. Instead, males recognize the calls of familiar rivals and respond accordingly.</p>
<p>To see how males would respond to the calls of unfamiliar rivals, the researchers went to a different rookery, at San Simeon State Park, and played back calls recorded at A&#241;o Nuevo. For each of ten mid-ranking males, they played one call from a dominant male and another call from a subordinate male. Instead of attacking or retreating, most males simply sat up and looked toward the speaker.</p>
<p>"They either ignored the speaker or seemed hesitant to respond, like they were looking for more information," Casey said.</p>
<p>Reichmuth noted that the call of an individual male is not only very distinctive, it is always the same, regardless of the situation. Whether engaged in combat or shooing away a low-ranking male, an individual's call did not vary at all. "It's impressive that they could stay that stable, which tells us how important it is for them to have an identity signal--a special vocal signature," she said. "Elephant seals have a fairly unique system of acoustic communication that is based on identification of familiar individuals and learning of social networks."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Conserving energy</strong></p>
<p>This communication system is important because it allows the males to conserve their energy and avoid unnecessary fights during a breeding season in which they are fasting for up to three months. The researchers observed individual male elephant seals engaging with as many as 43 opponents over the course of a single breeding season. Sustained fights occurred in less than 2 percent of the interactions and always involved males of similar dominance status that had not fought previously that season.</p>
<p>The study required an enormous effort over the course of four breeding seasons to record and mark all the males in the colony, observe their interactions, obtain recordings free of background noise, and conduct playback experiments within the large, dynamic colony.</p>
<p>"Many animal behavior studies involve observation and description of patterns of behavior, but doing field experiments is less common," Reichmuth said. "This study is a very thorough attempt to decode animal signaling through an extensive set of observational and experimental data."</p>

<p>Andrew Pilecki (<a href="http://andrewpilecki.com">andrewpilecki.com</a>) is the first postdoctoral Fulbright scholar to study at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya, a private university near Tel Aviv. Pilecki received his Ph.D. this summer in social psychology and looks at moral stereotypes and how they are used to justify violence against others.</p>
<p>Different groups tend to make judgments about others&#8217; moral behaviors in order to rationalize their own immoral behavior, he says. &#8220;The more immoral we think (others) are the more likely we are to accept things that harm them.&#8221;</p>
<p>For his next project, Pilecki said, &#8220;I want to examine how moral emotions of anger, disgust, and contempt correspond to actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Originally from New Jersey, Pilecki said that after graduating with a masters from St. Joseph&#8217;s University in Philadelphia in 2007 he was interested in a social identity approach to examining conflict &#8211; how people see themselves as members of a particular group.</p>
<p>Searching for graduate programs, he discovered that most social psychology programs did not examine things in that way. Though not initially interested in the Israel/Palestinian conflict he discovered the work of UC Santa Cruz associate professor of psychology Phil Hammack, who has done extensive research with young people from Palestinian and Israeli communities, focusing on attitudes toward conflict.</p>
<p>Pilecki began working with Hammack as his first graduate student and traveled to Israel and the West Bank in 2009 during his graduate studies. He leaves for Israel next month with his wife and 80-pound Alaskan malamute. &#160;He will be working with professor Eran Halperin at IDC Herzilya.</p>
<p>The United States-Israel Educational Foundation sponsored Pilecki for the Fulbright Postdoctoral Award. &#160;The foundation is a bi-national organization established between the U.S. and Israel to administer the Fulbright educational exchange program in Israel with the intent of increasing mutual understanding, scholastically and culturally, between the two countries through the exchange of students, teachers, lecturers and research scholars.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://andrewpilecki.com</url><title>Andrew Pilecki's research website</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="28a95022807270171bea963721edfea1"><name>farm-to-fork</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fifth annual Farm to Fork Benefit Dinner opens new Cowell Ranch Hay Barn </title><summary>The fifth annual Farm to Fork Benefit Dinner at the UC Santa Cruz Farm will be held at the newly renovated Cowell Ranch Hay Barn Saturday, September 12.</summary><start-date>1439496000000</start-date><display-name>Farm-to-Fork</display-name><path>/2015/08/farm-to-fork</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/farm-to-fork</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1439496228873</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1439502556592</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/raiford-matthew-cooking-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/raiford-matthew-cooking-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>raiford-matthew-cooking-350.jpg</name><display-name>raiford-matthew-cooking-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>180327</file-size><width>350</width><height>490</height></image><image-alt>Matthew Raiford</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/farm-to-fork-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/farm-to-fork-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>farm-to-fork-80.jpg</name><display-name>farm-to-fork-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>17790</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>farm to fork apron </image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Matthew Raiford, a 2011 graduate of the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, will be honored at this year's Farm to Fork benefit dinner, a tradition he founded five years ago.

Five UC Santa Cruz astronomers were involved in the discovery, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/08/12/science.aac5891">reported in the August 13 online edition of the journal <em>Science</em></a>.</p>
<p>Claire Max, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and director of UC Observatories, led observations at the W. M. Keck Observatory that confirmed the findings, after the planet was initially detected by the Gemini Planet Imager. This is the first exoplanet discovered by the Gemini Planet Imager, which was <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/01/planet-imager.html">assembled and tested at UC Santa Cruz</a> before being shipped to Chile for installation on the Gemini South Telescope. The instrument was designed specifically for discovering and analyzing faint, young planets orbiting bright stars.</p>
<p>While NASA's Kepler space observatory has discovered thousands of planets, it does so indirectly by detecting a loss of starlight as a planet passes in front of its star. The Gemini Planet Imager searches for light from the planet itself.</p>
<p>"To detect planets, Kepler sees their shadow. The Gemini Planet Imager instead sees their glow, which we refer to as direct imaging," said Bruce Macintosh of Stanford University, who led the collaboration.</p>
<p>Max and UC Santa Cruz graduate student Alex Rudy used the NIRC2 camera at Keck to observe the planet in wavelengths of light not seen by the Gemini instrument. "Observations using the NIRC2 camera and adaptive optics system at the Keck Observatory allowed the GPI team to independently verify the existence of the planet," Macintosh said. "NIRC2 can observe at longer infrared wavelengths than GPI, where a cool planet like 51 Eri b is brighter. These longer-wavelength observations helped to measure the properties of clouds in the planet's atmosphere that absorb and re-radiate infrared emission."</p>
<p><strong>Young star</strong></p>
<p>The host star, 51 Eri, is very young, a mere 20 million years old, and is slightly hotter than the Sun. The exoplanet 51 Eri b, whose mass is estimated to be roughly twice that of Jupiter, appears to orbit its host star at a distance 13 times greater than the Earth-Sun distance. If placed in our own solar system, 51 Eri b's orbit would lie between those of Saturn and Neptune.</p>
<p>As far as the cosmic clock is concerned, 20 million years is young, and that is exactly what made the direct detection of the planet possible. When planets coalesce, material falling into the planet releases energy and heats it up. Over the next hundred million years the planet radiates that energy away, mostly as infrared light.</p>
<p>In addition to being the lowest-mass planet ever imaged, it's also one of the coldest&#8212;800 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas others are around 1,200 F&#8212;and features the strongest atmospheric methane signal on record. Previous Jupiter-like exoplanets have shown only faint traces of methane, far different from the heavy methane atmospheres of the gas giants in our solar system.</p>
<p>"In the atmospheres of the cold giant planets of our solar system, carbon is found as methane, unlike most exoplanets, where carbon has mostly been found in the form of carbon monoxide," said Mark Marley, an astrophysicist at NASA Ames Research Center. "Since the atmosphere of 51 Eri b is also methane rich, it signifies that this planet is well on its way to becoming a cousin of our own familiar Jupiter."</p>
<p><strong>A young Jupiter</strong></p>
<p>All of these characteristics, the researchers say, point to a planet that is very much what models suggest Jupiter was like in its infancy. Of course, it's not exactly like Jupiter&#8212;its 800 F temperature is still hot enough to melt lead&#8212;but there are signs it will evolve into a familiar shape.</p>
<p>In addition to expanding the universe of known planets, the Gemini Planet Imager will provide key clues as to how solar systems form. Astronomers believe that the gas giants in our solar system formed by building up a large core over a few million years and then pulling in a huge amount of hydrogen and other gases to form an atmosphere.</p>
<p>But the Jupiter-like exoplanets that have so far been discovered are much hotter than models have predicted, hinting that they could have formed much faster as material collapses quickly to make a very hot planet. This is an important difference. The core-buildup process can also form rocky planets like Earth; a fast and hot collapse might only make giant gassy planets. 51 Eri b is young enough that it "remembers" its formation.</p>

In addition to a $25,000 unrestricted cash gift, he will be presented with a bronze statue of Princess Grace, created by the Dutch artist Kees Verkade, at the Prince&#8217;s Palace of Monaco on September 5.</p>
<p>The up-and-coming 38-year-old director, writer, producer, and cinematographer picked up an Emmy Award last summer in the category of &#8220;Outstanding Director for a Drama Series&#8221; for the HBO series <em>True Detective</em>.</p>
<p>Fukunaga first gained notice when he received the best "Directing, U.S. Drama" award at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival for his debut feature film <em>Sin Nombre</em>. He wrote and directed the film based on his own firsthand experiences with Central American immigrants seeking a better life in the U.S. He also directed <em>Jane Eyre</em> in 2011.</p>
<p>Fukunaga&#8217;s latest film, <em>Beasts of No Nation</em>, starring Idris Elba, will premiere in October 2015.</p>
<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz Film and Digital Media student</strong> Jeny Amaya will receive the Cary Grant Film Award and a Film Undergraduate Scholarship. Her recent work examines the Salvadoran diaspora experience in California.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a filmmaker, I want to resurrect fragments of the past and apply new meanings to them using the theoretical frameworks of my Latin American and Latino studies, feminism, and film studies education,&#8221; said Amaya.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the process, my aim is to reclaim the agency of Salvadoran immigrants living in the United States, particularly Salvadoran women, while encouraging my viewers to identify with subjects and issues that are often overlooked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amaya&#8217;s work has been featured at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History, the Porter Sesnon Underground Gallery, and in the 2014 Santa Cruz Film Festival.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2d172f25807270171bea9637e13325cc"><name>pge-testing-gas-pipeline</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Aug. 15 — PG&amp;E testing natural gas pipeline</title><summary>This is a reminder that PG&amp;E, which provides natural gas to UC Santa Cruz, will be testing its main pipeline through Santa Cruz County beginning Aug. 15.</summary><start-date>1439449200000</start-date><display-name>Aug. 15 — PG&amp;E testing natural gas pipeline</display-name><path>/2015/08/pge-testing-gas-pipeline</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/pge-testing-gas-pipeline</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1439570538241</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1441999015937</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><em>Update: PG&amp;E completed its natural gas transmission pipeline hydrostatic testing on September 1. UCSC and the surrounding area service were returned to normal operations. PG&amp;E sends its appreciation to the campus community for its curtailment efforts during this testing period.</em> 
<p dir="ltr"><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>This is a reminder that PG&amp;E, which provides natural gas to UC Santa Cruz, will be testing its main pipeline through Santa Cruz County beginning Aug. 15. In order to do this testing, PG&amp;E will be reducing the gas supply to its customers served by this pipeline. &#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"><span>The testing is scheduled to last up to two weeks, but could last longer if PG&amp;E discovers any problems. In the event this occurs, Physical Plant will notify the campus of the impacts.</span><span><br class="kix-line-break"/>
</span> <span><br class="kix-line-break"/>
</span> <span>UC Santa Cruz uses natural gas to heat water and buildings, and to generate electricity. The campus will be able to continue heating its buildings and water through an established gas supply backfeed, and electricity will be supplied by PG&amp;E. This reduced natural gas supply will provide the campus with an adequate amount of natural gas for building comfort but high-demand equipment, such as the new cogeneration plant, will not be online during this period. We don&#8217;t expect to notice any campus impacts.</span><span><br class="kix-line-break"/>
</span> <span><br class="kix-line-break"/>
</span> <span>However, I ask that you be mindful of, and conserve, your natural gas usage while the main pipe is offline and undergoing these tests.</span> <span><br class="kix-line-break"/>
</span> <span><br class="kix-line-break"/>
</span> <span>My team worked with PG&amp;E to schedule this testing during one of the quietest times at UC Santa Cruz and during one of the lowest natural gas load periods of the year. I appreciate your patience and help in making this a successful operation.</span></span></p>

<p>After fighting cancer since December, UC Santa Cruz Professor of Anthropology Emerita Diane Lewis&#160;died Thursday in her home surrounded by her daughter Raven Chaney and her grandchildren Kevin and Rosalie Chisolm.</p>
<p>Professor Lewis was born and raised in Los Angeles where she attended Manual Arts High School. After completing her B.A. and M.A. at UCLA, she obtained her Ph.D. in anthropology from Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., in 1962. While at Cornell, she did field work in Malaysia, and later published on Negeri Sembilan Malays&#8217; rules for agrarian change, and fieldwork as ideology in anthropology.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz appointed Lewis as a professor of anthropology in 1974 after she had served as a member of San Francisco State&#8217;s faculty since 1962. While teaching at UCSC, Lewis completed a masters of public health in epidemiology at UC Berkeley in 1987 and was immediately awarded a University of California two-year grant by the University Task Force on AIDS Research. Professor Lewis was a pre-eminent activist scholar on black women&#8217;s response to inequality, the black family, back and white women prisoners, and black women&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>After retiring from UCSC in 1993, Lewis worked as a volunteer tutor with Santa Cruz&#8217;s Literacy Center for three years, tutoring English as a Second Language students. She was also a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) for a year and a half. Lewis helped organize the Santa Cruz &#8212; Guama, Santiago, Cuba, Sister City relationship and co-led a delegation of bilingual teachers to a conference in Cuba in 2004. In 2015, she was a member of the Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom, the Society for Applied Anthropology, and the Retired Public Employees&#8217; Association. Lewis loved gardening and speaking Spanish.</p>
<p>She is survived by her daughter Raven Chaney, her grandchildren Kevin, Rosalie, and Corey Chisolm, her sister Candace Luster, brother George Lewis, niece Christian Havens and grandnephew Jared Perry. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Bancroft, Attn. Kim Minton, Senior Director Individual Giving, 800 N. Kings Highway, Suite 308, Cherry Hill, N.J. 08034 (www.bancroft.org). A memorial service with be held at 3 p.m. Saturday, August 22, at Pacific Gardens Chapel, 1050 Cayuga St., Santa Cruz, Ca. 95062.&#160;</p>

honoring Coeleen Kiebert at UC Santa Cruz's Cowell College</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The courtyard outside the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery at Cowell College was packed Friday evening with friends and admirers of distinguished artist, teacher and UC Santa Cruz alumna Coeleen Kiebert.<br/>
 <br/>
 The occasion was the dedication of the new <em>Coeleen Kiebert Patio</em> at that very spot, made possible by a passionate contingent of artistic friends. <br/>
 <br/>
 Nearly 100 people from the community contributed over $100,000 to make it happen. Their goal was to celebrate the importance of the arts in education&#8212;and the importance of Coeleen Kiebert in promoting the arts. <br/>
 <br/>
 For the past four decades, Kiebert&#8217;s work has been exhibited in museums, galleries and private collections throughout the world. Locally, her work is on display in downtown Santa Cruz at the Pacific Garden Mall and in the Sculpture Garden of the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History. <br/>
 <br/>
 Kiebert arrived at UC Santa Cruz in the 1970s after completing a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Minnesota in Art Education. She graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1980 with a Master of Science degree in Psychology, where she studied the psychology of creativity&#8212;all the while continuing to create sculptures in ceramics and bronze. &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 Kiebert also taught art and sculpture through UCSC Extension from 1996 to 2009 and has for many years served as a bridge between UC Santa Cruz and the regional arts community.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;We are delighted to show our thanks and love by making permanent our appreciation,&#8221; said Mary Alice Copp, one of the volunteers who helped spearhead the fundraising effort. &#8220;The naming of the patio after Coeleen is the first time a space at Cowell College has been named after a former student. That is because her contributions to our community have been so transformative and profound.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Fundraising was never so easy and rewarding,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Gifts came not only from Santa Cruz, but also from Berkeley, San Francisco, Sacramento, New Jersey, New York, Florida, New Mexico and Holland!&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>In addition to an exhibition of Kiebert&#8217;s sculptures</strong> on display in the adjacent Smith Gallery, the dedication also included the unveiling of two sculptures that will permanently reside in the Kiebert Sculpture Patio. <br/>
 <br/>
 The first piece, titled &#8220;Eve Embracing the Snake,&#8221; was created by artist Nic Yonc and discovered by Kiebert in the Netherlands. The second, titled &#8220;China Rock,&#8221; was created by Kiebert and inspired by her travels in China and Japan.<br/>
 <br/>
 Cowell College Provost Faye Crosby praised Kiebert&#8217;s teaching expertise and her distinct influence on such a wide variety of students over the years.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Many of Coeleen&#8217;s students from her long years as a master teacher are here today,&#8221; Crosby noted. &#8220;Of her teaching, Coeleen says that there are two components--the technical and the philosophical. She aims to enable her students to develop a personal understanding of their own creativity even as they gain technical skills.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
 Crosby added: &#8220;And of her work, Coeleen says, &#8216;My art is an expression of a mysterious, quiet story that has within it a line of truth deeper than I am able to see in any other way.&#8217;&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="46b65f89807270171bea9637e9feb1c0"><name>crews-dickson-prof</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Dickson Emeriti Professorship awarded to chemist Phil Crews</title><summary>The Edward A.

Dickson Emeriti Professorship for the 2015-16 academic year.</p>
<p>The Dickson Emeritus Professorships are awarded annually and funded by an endowment from the estate of former UC Regent Edward A. Dickson. The honor recognizes Crews for his contributions to research, teaching, and public service. This award will enable him to teach a chemistry graduate course ("Spectroscopy and Applied Analytical Methods") in 2016.</p>
<p>Crews said he is enthused about teaching the course, which is a critical part of the curriculum for graduate students in organic chemistry. Crews is the lead author of a widely used textbook on the subject, <em>Organic Structure Analysis,</em> published by Oxford University Press and coauthored by two colleagues (Jaime Rodriguez and Marcel Jaspars) who were postdoctoral researchers in his lab in the 1990s.</p>
<p>"Teaching this course again will catalyze my work on a revision of the book," he said. "The second edition came out in 2010, so we need to make timely progress on completing a third edition."</p>
<p><strong>Active research lab</strong></p>
<p>Crews, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1970, retired in 2012 from regular teaching duties. He continues to run an active research laboratory that includes several postdoctoral fellows, staff scientists, undergraduate students, and visiting professors. Supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and National Science foundation, the team is investigating the chemistry of marine natural products. The Crews lab isolates and characterizes unique chemicals from sponges and marine microorganisms, searching for compounds with potential therapeutic value in treating human diseases. Crews and his collaborators have identified several compounds that show promise for the future development of drugs to fight cancer and other diseases.</p>
<p>Crews served as President of the American Society of Pharmacognosy for 2014-15. A fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, he has received many awards and honors for his achievements, including the 2008-09 Outstanding Faculty Award from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences.</p>
<p>In 1994, with a grant from the National Institutes of Health, Crews founded the ACCESS program to introduce community college students from underrepresented backgrounds to research opportunities at UC Santa Cruz. The grant was renewed this year, providing continued funding of the program for another five years. He also continues to be involved in building the infrastructure of the chemistry department, most recently as principal investigator of a grant funded by the National Science Foundation that brought a cutting-edge mass spectrometer to the campus.</p>
<p>Edward A. Dickson served as a Regent of the University of California from 1913 to 1946, the longest tenure of any Regent. In 1955, Dickson presented the University with a gift endowment which enables each campus to make an annual award recognizing teaching, research, or public service by one or more emeritus professors.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="47cd77c7807270171bea9637b5fb2ab3"><name>seagate-gift</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Seagate gift supports UC Santa Cruz research on genomic data storage</title><summary>Donation includes 2.5 petabytes of storage for studying large-scale data storage challenges in genomics and other areas</summary><keywords>genomics big data, data storage, Storage Systems Research Center, Center for Research in Storage Systems, Ethan Miller, Andy Hospodor, Benedict Paten, Genomics Institute</keywords><start-date>1440054000000</start-date><display-name>Seagate gift supports UC Santa Cruz research on genomic data storage</display-name><path>/2015/08/seagate-gift</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/seagate-gift</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1440018692005</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1440085146599</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/ethan-miller-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/ethan-miller-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ethan-miller-350.jpg</name><display-name>ethan-miller-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>93558</file-size><width>350</width><height>351</height></image><image-alt>Ethan Miller</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/ethan-miller-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/ethan-miller-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ethan-miller-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ethan-miller-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>34989</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Ethan Miller</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Ethan Miller, professor of computer science, directs the Center for Research in Storage Systems (CRSS).

Seagate has donated data storage devices with a total capacity of 2.5 petabytes to support this effort.</p>
<p>"This gift provides the basis for a major research program on storage of genomic data," said Andy Hospodor, executive director of the <a href="http://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu/">Storage Systems Research Center</a> (SSRC) at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Seagate is pleased to be a part of this important research effort. The storage requirements for genomics are staggering and the potential for medical breakthroughs even larger," said Mark Re, senior vice president and CTO at Seagate.</p>
<p>The gift, valued at $250,000, includes 1 petabyte of Seagate's new Kinetic disk drives for object-based storage, plus an additional 1.5 petabytes of traditional Seagate SATA disk drives for use in existing clusters within the <a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Large-scale test bed</strong></p>
<p>"This gives us a large-scale test bed that we can use to explore the organization of data for large-scale disk-based storage systems. We need to develop better ways to store and organize the vast quantities of data we're generating," said Ethan Miller, professor of computer science and director of the <a href="http://www.crss.ucsc.edu/">Center for Research in Storage Systems</a> (CRSS) at UCSC.</p>
<p>Miller and other storage systems researchers at UC Santa Cruz work closely with industry partners such as Seagate, and several of the center's alumni and graduate students have been working at Seagate on the company's latest disk technology. The Seagate storage donation will support research on new ways to structure and store genomic data using object stores and newly proposed open-source standards (APIs) for genomic data that are being developed by the <a href="http://genomicsandhealth.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health</a>.</p>
<p>"Genomic data storage is one of several areas of emerging interest where we'll be looking at using Seagate's new intelligent disks to build large-scale storage systems," Miller said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Genomics Institute</strong></p>
<p>The donation also adds over a petabyte of storage capacity to the genomics data storage cluster maintained by the <a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a> at the San Diego Supercomputing Center. For Benedict Paten, a research scientist at the Genomics Institute, it's all about speeding up the processing of genomic data.</p>
<p>"We in genomics know that we have a big data problem," Paten said. "We need to be able to compute on much larger volumes of data than we have before. The amount of genomic data is growing exponentially, and we haven't been keeping up."</p>
<p>Part of the solution, he said, is distributed processing of large data sets in which the processing is done where the data are stored, instead of downloading the data over a network for processing. "Now we can put a lot of disks on the compute nodes for efficient distributed computation over large amounts of data. This donation is really important for our big data genomics efforts at UC Santa Cruz," Paten said.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, August 26, from 7 to 8 p.m., UC Santa Cruz will harness the power of social media during a &#8220;New Parent Chat,&#8221; a live Facebook event featuring a panel of three experts representing &#160;colleges, housing, and orientation, to talk about the upcoming &#160;academic year.</p>
<p>Topics will include campus life, housing, dining, and any other subject that crosses the parents&#8217; minds.</p>
<p>While parents who participate will enjoy the dynamic of a "real time" conversation, those who miss out can also benefit; the questions and comments will remain on Facebook, so parents can visit the page and still contribute to the dialogue even when the live portion of the discussion is over.&#160;This is the second time UCSC has held the live parent chat, which aims to increase parent engagement and provide resources for parents using UC Santa Cruz social media. &#160;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to join in if you are a new UC Santa Cruz parent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in to Facebook on Aug. 26 at 7 p.m.</li>
<li>Go to&#160;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ucsantacruz">https://www.facebook.com/ucsantacruz</a></li>
<li>Then, after &#8220;liking&#8221; the page, look for the post about the LIVE Facebook chat</li>
<li>At that point you can comment and ask questions at will, then sit back and watch the answers roll in from the expert panel, who will all be gathered in one room on campus.</li>
</ul>
<p>"We hope to provide parents with an opportunity to ask burning questions or questions they have not yet had the chance to ask,&#8221;&#160;said Carolyn Golz, college administrative officer at Cowell and Stevenson colleges, who is part of the panel of experts.</p>
<p>Aside from Golz, the panel will also include Chris Banks, manager of marketing and communications&#160;for Colleges, Housing and Educational Services, and Teresa Ruiz Decker, social media and marketing manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is such a great way to speak with parents directly at what can be a pivotal time for everyone in the family,&#8221; Decker said. &#8220;There are mixed emotions of pride, joy, concern and a little sadness many parents experience as their sons and daughters move away."</p>
<p>Golz agreed.</p>
<p>"Chatting with university staff before move in can help relieve some of the stress and anxiety families of new students might be feeling as they prepare to send their students to college,&#8221;&#160;Golz said.&#160;"Those who participated last year asked great questions and, hopefully, found the experience well worth the time and effort."</p>
<p>"Last year&#8217;s social chat showed there is a real community of UCSC parents who want to stay connected to their student&#8217;s university life,&#8221; Decker said. "We really value that parent experience and perspective here.&#8221;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.facebook.com/ucsantacruz</url><title>UC Santa Cruz Facebook</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4cd70441807270171bea9637735e3a69"><name>holocaust-legacy-course</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz launches new legacy course on the Holocaust with Coursera </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has launched a new version of its free online course, "The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry," through the Coursera platform.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, holocaust studies, coursera, holocaust online courses</keywords><start-date>1440106500000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz launches new legacy course on the Holocaust with Coursera </display-name><path>/2015/08/holocaust-legacy-course</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/holocaust-legacy-course</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1440103203877</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1440451854490</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value><value>Jewish Studies</value><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/murray-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/murray-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>murray-300.jpg</name><display-name>murray-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>39256</file-size><width>300</width><height>238</height></image><image-alt>Murray Baumgarten</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/murray-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/murray-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>murray-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>murray-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22666</file-size><width>81</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Murray Baumgarten</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Murray Baumgarten</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/kenez-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/kenez-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kenez-300.jpg</name><display-name>kenez-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>36367</file-size><width>300</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt>Peter Kenez</image-alt><image-caption>Peter Kenez</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>UC Santa Cruz has launched a new version of its free online course, <em>The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry</em>, through the Coursera platform. 
<p>The course was developed and is taught by professors Murray Baumgarten and Peter Kenez, based on their acclaimed UC Santa Cruz class that they taught in-person on campus for over three decades. It is preserved as a UCSC legacy course in an online, on-demand format, free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Kenez is a native of Hungary and a Holocaust survivor. A professor emeritus in the History Department at UC Santa Cruz, he received his Ph.D. from Harvard University and has been teaching Russian and modern European history at UCSC since 1966.</p>
<p>Kenez is the author of eight books, including the autobiographical <em>Varieties of Fear: Growing Up Jewish Under Nazism and Communism</em> and his most recent work, <em>From Antisemitism to Genocide; the Origins of the Holocaust</em>.</p>
<p>Baumgarten (B.A. Columbia, Ph.D. Berkeley) is a distinguished professor of English &amp; contemporary literature and a founding director of The Dickens Project at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Baumgarten is the recipient of a campus award for excellence in teaching, and his recent work has focused on the Jews of Venice and the afterlife of the Ghetto.</p>
<p><em>The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry</em> traces the destruction of the Jews and Jewish life in Europe by Nazi Germany, drawing on major works of history, literature, and film. It explores not only the destruction of European Jewry, but also the shifting historical conditions from which the Holocaust emerged.</p>
<p>Students taking the eight-week class will study memoirs, historical documents, poetry, documentary footage, films, novels, and other media that help to illustrate the variety of human experience during this important historical episode.</p>
<p>The course is designed to provide participants with an expanded knowledge and understanding of Eastern and Western Jewish communities, the origins and development of anti-Semitism, the formation and operation of concentration camps, resistance movements, and the Holocaust as a problem for world history.</p>

<p>A concerned parent called the campus police department at about 7 p.m. Wednesday after he discovered the post. Officers were able to find the suspect and evidence that he wrote the post.</p>
<p>Officers arrested Ayman Kareem Hawari on a suspicion of making terrorist threats and of resisting arrest. He was booked into the Santa Cruz County Jail shortly after midnight. So far, officers have found no connection between Hawari and the campus. The investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>The post didn't target any individuals, though it included general threats against two campus colleges, Oakes and Porter.</p>
<p>More concerned community members have contacted the police after seeing the post.</p>
<p>The police department is asking for the community's help in sharing any additional information about Hawari.</p>

<p>A distinguished scientist, Max has been serving as interim director of UCO since June 2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am thrilled to be named the new director of UC Observatories, where I will be able to support the vital research and scientific aspirations of the UC astronomy community,&#8221; said Max. &#8220;I look forward with great pleasure to working with my fellow astronomers, the UC Office of the President, and the broader UC community to develop and implement a shared vision for UC Observatories.&#8221;</p>
<p>Max has been appointed to a five-year term beginning retroactively on July 1, 2015, and extending through June 30, 2020. She previously worked at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and in 2001 joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz, where she co-founded and led the Center for Adaptive Optics. Max is best known for her contributions to laser guide star adaptive optics, a technology that removes the blurring effects of turbulence in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Observatories are an important part of the university&#8217;s research enterprise and provide our faculty and graduate students with opportunities to make great strides in astronomy and astrophysics,&#8221; said President Napolitano. &#8220;As a UC faculty member, practicing astronomer, and respected researcher, Dr. Max understands the needs and the enormous potential of UC Observatories. She will provide excellent leadership as this program continues to chart its future.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Lick, Keck, and TMT</strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz serves as the host campus for UCO, which operates the Lick Observatory as well as technical labs at UCLA and UC Santa Cruz. UCO also provides administrative and scientific support for UC&#8217;s partnership in the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and is the central coordinator for the UC participation in the Thirty Meter Telescope project.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UC Santa Cruz campus is proud to host UC Observatories, and we are thrilled that such a distinguished and able UCSC faculty member has been appointed to lead this prestigious program,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal. &#8220;As a fellow astronomer, I look forward to working with Dr. Max to ensure a thriving future for UC Observatories.&#8221;</p>
<p>Max is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the SPIE International Society for Optics and Photonics. She has received numerous awards, including the U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s E. O. Lawrence Award in Physics in 2004 and, most recently, the 2015 Joseph Weber Award for Astronomical Instrumentation from the American Astronomical Society.</p>
<p>Max was selected as UCO director after an international search chaired by UC San Diego Professor Emeritus Charles Kennel and conducted by a committee of experienced astronomers and administrators from UC campuses, UC-affiliated national laboratories, and other national and international institutions. The search process included consultations with UC Academic Senate leaders and chancellors at UC&#8217;s astronomy campuses, which include Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz. Additional input was solicited from faculty and staff at UC&#8217;s astronomy campuses and others throughout the UC community.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.ucolick.org/home/</url><title>UC Observatories</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.ucolick.org/main/</url><title>Lick Observatory</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="524e52288072701704d605cb0aab892c"><name>lipson</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Farm to label: How alumnus helped bring organic labeling policy to the nation</title><summary>Mark Lipson, now a research associate at Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, was instrumental in standardizing organic farming in the U.S. Now back at UCSC, he continues the mission of institutionalizing public policy support for organic farming.</summary><start-date>1440195000000</start-date><display-name>Mark Lipson</display-name><path>/2015/08/lipson</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/lipson</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1440194908391</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1441127602809</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdwitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/lipson-mark-mdw-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/lipson-mark-mdw-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lipson-mark-mdw-500.jpg</name><display-name>lipson-mark-mdw-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>276799</file-size><width>500</width><height>667</height></image><image-alt>Mark Lipson</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/lipson-mark-mdw-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/lipson-mark-mdw-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lipson-mark-mdw-80.jpg</name><display-name>lipson-mark-mdw-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>20943</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Mark LIpson </image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz almnus Mark Lipson worked on consistent organic labeling standards from Santa Cruz to Sacramento to Washington, D.C.

Since the early 1970s, the label has moved from an agricultural outlier to the American mainstream, from the local farmers market to chain stores.</p>
<p>Thanks in large part to UC Santa Cruz alumnus Mark Lipson (Merrill, &#8216;81, environmental studies), American consumers today can better trust what they eat is organically grown and farmers know alternative ways to produce and market their crops. For more than 30 years, Lipson has diligently upheld the organic label&#8217;s integrity. He advocated for its acceptance in an era when organics was on the fringe and pushed for ethical standards when its boom was exploited.</p>
<p>Lipson&#8217;s career has taken him from Santa Cruz to Washington D.C. and back again. He has returned to his UC Santa Cruz roots as a research associate with UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, the first university program dedicated to teaching organic farming practices.</p>
<p><strong>Early roots</strong></p>
<p>Lipson has been an ambassador for the organic food movement since the early 1980s. He was the first paid staff member at California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF), based in Santa Cruz and now the largest organic certification organization in the country. He was also policy director at the Organic Farming Research Foundation, also based in Santa Cruz, that funds original research into organic farming methods.</p>
<p>He then joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture as the country&#8217;s top organic and sustainable agriculture policy advisor, the first such appointment at that high a level.</p>
<p>It all started in 1980 with a vegetable garden at the Merrill College provost&#8217;s house on the UC Santa Cruz campus. As a student, Lipson cultivated more than just a passion for gardening. He found allies with his neighbors, a group of young apprentices pioneering organic farming methods at the adjacent Alan Chadwick Garden. He picked up gardening advice, seedling starts, and new friends. These friends, affiliated with the UCSC Farm and Garden, became fellow co-founders of the Molino Creek Farming Collective, a farm they started in 1982 in the hills near Davenport, nine miles north of Santa Cruz, where Lipson lives today.</p>
<p><strong>Early confusion<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>When Lipson joined CCOF as its first staff member in 1985, the group&#8217;s standards were the de facto national standard because they were the only standard. &#160;But as Lipson came to realize there were many inconsistencies in the agricultural community of what was organic. As the industry boomed in the late 1980s, the label became widely used and abused, misunderstood and misappropriated. The marketplace was chaotic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all labels were the same and it was difficult to grow the market because of mislabeling,&#8221; Lipson said. &#8220;The consumer didn&#8217;t know what they were getting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farmers were also at a disadvantage. &#8220;They were not on a level playing field,&#8221; he said. &#160;</p>
<p>It was not until federal legislation and a set of regulations that Lipson helped pass, that the industry found consistency and transparency in organics.</p>
<p>In 1989, Lipson pushed further the need to legitimize an organics food standard and institute a label that consumers could trust. He cold-called the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture&#160;and spoke with then junior staffer, Kathleen Merrigan (who later became the deputy secretary of agriculture in the Obama administration). He identified the problems the industry faced and explained the benefits for a standardized certification process. Receptive and inspired, Merrigan brought the project to Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the committee chair.</p>
<p><strong>Federal law drafted</strong></p>
<p>With Merrigan and a large cast of organic farmers from around the country, Lipson helped draft a federal law to set national regulation for organic farming production and the &#8220;Organically Produced&#8221; label. The Organic Foods Production Act was passed in 1990 but not without controversy, especially when the USDA began to write the implementing regulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first draft of the regulation was hugely rejected by the organic community,&#8221; Lipson remembers. He helped spearheaded a comment process that resulted in 275,000 public remarks, the most public commentary the federal government had received since the proposed regulation of tobacco as a drug.</p>
<p>With help and support from Lipson and others, the rules were rewritten and finalized in the last days of the Clinton administration in 2000 and went into effect in 2002. This marked a pivot point for the organics industry. &#160;</p>
<p>But it could not have happened without active involvement from the marketplace, Lipson says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Establishing federal standards was a catalyst that would not have happened without the critical mass of producers on the ground doing it and a consumer interest in a less toxic food supply.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Backfilling the science</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Getting the rules done was a huge lift, but unfortunately the need for research got left behind,&#8221; Lipson says now regretfully. The original draft of the 1990 law contained provisions for research funding but they were left out of the final bill. &#160;Lipson&#8217;s career turned to the need for scientific improvement of organic agriculture.</p>
<p>From 1997-2010 he directed a policy program at the Organic Farming Research Foundation aimed at federal support for organic farming research. During that time, he and his colleagues built the case and won political victories to move federal research funding from essentially zero to over $20 million per year. &#160;&#8220;That&#8217;s a dramatic increase, but still a small fraction of the U.S. ag research budget,&#8221; he notes.</p>
<p>As federal funding increased for organics in the U.S., so did Lipson&#8217;s involvement in government. &#160;From 2010 to 2014 he worked under Merrigan at the USDA in Washington. His job was to advocate for organics internally and educate policy makers in the department and on Capitol Hill. He chaired the USDA Organic Working Group, an internal communication and collaboration network with representatives from across the USDA.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a disconnect between policy professionals and what is really practical on a farm,&#8221; Lipson says. &#8220;There are actually very few farmers working inside USDA or in Congress.&#8221; Moving forward, he hopes to change that.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiring the next generation</strong></p>
<p>While the organic movement has moved into mainstream consciousness, there is still a long way to go to advance organic farming methods, Lipson says. While consumers can advocate for change, he argues that the marketplace has limitations and the field needs more federal resources to explore new challenges and circumstances farmers now face.</p>
<p>Back at UC Santa Cruz, Lipson wants to inspire a new generation of analysts and policymakers to advocate for advancing research and institutional change for supporting organics. &#160;&#8220;We need a lot more organic hearts and minds in the policy sphere.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/02/history-organic-book.html</url><title>Book traces UC Santa Cruz’s role in organics and the sustainable farm movement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="662e52f68072701704d605cbf295149e"><name>rev-fall-15-about-the-cover</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>About the cover</title><summary>Catherine Ramírez, associate professor of Latin American and Latino studies and director of the campus's Chicano Latino Research Center, is among the hundreds of UC Santa Cruz faculty whose bold ideas push boundaries and challenge assumptions.</summary><keywords>Catherine Ramírez, associate professor of Latin American and Latino studies, Chicano Latino Research Center</keywords><start-date>1440486000000</start-date><display-name>About the cover</display-name><path>/2015/08/rev-fall-15-about-the-cover</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/rev-fall-15-about-the-cover</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1440528356063</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1442003448914</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/catherine.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/catherine.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>catherine.jpg</name><display-name>catherine.jpg</display-name><file-size>73915</file-size><width>400</width><height>479</height></image><image-alt>Catherine Ramírez, associate professor of Latin American and Latino studies and director o</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/catherine-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/catherine-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>catherine-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>catherine-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>4954</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Catherine Ramírez, associate professor of Latin American and Latino studies and director o</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Catherine Ram&#237;rez, associate professor of Latin American and Latino studies and director of UC Santa Cruz's Chicano Latino Research Center (photo by Elena Zhukova)</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Catherine Ram&#237;rez, associate professor of Latin American and Latino studies and director of the campus's Chicano Latino Research Center, is among the hundreds of UC Santa Cruz faculty whose bold ideas push boundaries and challenge assumptions.</p>

<p>Hundreds of alumni from across the decades reconnected with each other and the campus, laughing, sharing memories, and feeling grateful for the years they spent here.</p>
<p>Our biggest Alumni Weekend yet made me more proud than ever to be the chancellor of UC Santa Cruz. The celebrations of our 50th year have been a smashing success so far, with more to come this fall.</p>
<p>It's gratifying to see the UC Santa Cruz community recognize this anniversary and the strengths and accomplishments of our first half-century.</p>
<p>What will we do in our next five decades?</p>
<p>Considering its relative youth and modest size, this campus has made outsized contributions. We are consistently ranked one of the best young universities in the world, and our pathbreaking research has tsunami-sized effects that upend disciplines.</p>
<p>We will build on this foundation during the next 50 years, making our mark in fields we can't even dream of today. After all, what did our founders know in 1965 about sequencing the human genome, one of our signature achievements?</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz's leadership in bioinformatics opened the door to research and scientific breakthroughs that are transforming the medical field and ushering in the era of precision medicine. This is how we will decode cancer. It's how we will tailor treatment to individual patients.</p>
<p>Our breakthroughs in astronomy will yield stunning insights into our understanding of the universe, and our discoveries about the deep oceans and the coastal environment will prompt policy changes to protect these precious resources.</p>
<p>Our commitment to social justice will help us find answers to persistent questions of inequality, from feeding a growing population to providing access to education.</p>
<p>New forms of creative expression will sustain and challenge us, while scholarship in the humanities will enrich and transform our relationships with ourselves and one another.</p>
<p>We will grow our 100,000- strong alumni community, enhance the educational experience for a more diverse group of students than ever, and much more.</p>
<p>At the juncture of our first 50 years and the next, I am filled with optimism and eager to usher in the next wave of achievement.</p>
<p>Fiat Slugs, indeed!</p>

<h3>Mapping our genomic differences</h3>
<p>A $2 million gift to UC Santa Cruz from the W.M. Keck Foundation supports the building of the Human Genome Variation Map. The new guide will provide a means to name, identify, and analyze all common variations in the human genome, greatly enhancing both medical research and basic research in life sciences.</p>
<p>The gift comes as UC Santa Cruz celebrates the 15th anniversary of its assembly and posting of the first human genome. In the spirit of that project, when completed, the variation map also will be publicly and freely available to all.</p>
<p>The Keck gift follows earlier support from the Simons Foundation. Building support for the work of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute is a key priority of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>Alumna Patricia Rebele (Porter '88) and her husband, Rowland, made a gift of $500,000 to the Cowell Press Endowment, established in 2013 by Cowell and Porter colleges. For more than 40 years the press has served as a center of hands-on creativity in typography and printing. The gift supports the Transformative Student Experience initiative of the campaign.</p>
<h3>Bringing back the Quarry</h3>
<p>Building on strong student support (a commitment of up to $6.38 million in fees) toward reopening the Quarry Amphitheater, alumni and other friends of the campus have given more than $250,000. Another $1.5 million is needed to reopen the iconic space. Learn how you can be a part of bringing back the Quarry at <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu">campaign.ucsc.edu</a>. The Quarry is a priority in the campaign's Transformative Student Experience initiative.</p>
<h3>A table's worth of chairs</h3>
<p>When UC President Janet Napolitano announced a program to accelerate creation of faculty chairs on the UC campuses with matching funds of $500,000 per chair, UC Santa Cruz was first to take up the offer. And it has now matched donors with all eight chairs available. Chairs bring honor to the recipient and provide critical support for faculty and graduate students.</p>
<p>Donors have funded chairs in each academic division and the library. They are:</p>
<p><strong>Sage Weil Presidential Chair for Open Source Software</strong> (<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/sage-weil-gifts.html">see more on the Sage Weil gift</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Jordan-Stern Presidential Chair for Dickens and 19th Century Literature Studies,</strong> funded by John Jordan and Michael Stern</p>
<p><strong>Wilton W. Webster Jr. Natural Reserves Presidential Chair,</strong> funded by the Helen and Will Webster Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Stephen R. Gliessman Presidential Chair in Water Resources and Food System Sustainability,</strong> funded by the Helen and Will Webster Foundation</p>
<p><strong>The Faggin Family Presidential Chair for the Physics of Information,</strong> funded by Federico Faggin</p>
<p><strong>Kenneth R. Corday Family Presidential Chair in Writing for Television and Film,</strong> funded by the Corday Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Richard L. Press University Librarian Presidential Chair held by UC Santa Cruz Librarian Elizabeth Cowell,</strong> funded by the Helen and Will Webster Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Symantec Presidential Chair in Storage and Security</strong> held by Professor Ethan Miller, funded by Symantec Corporation</p>

<h3>Gratitude for lasting gifts</h3>
<p>My wife Julie (Abramson) is a 1977 Crown grad. When I met her I was living with some dear friends who were attending UC Santa Cruz and living in a house at the end of Swift Street.</p>
<p>One of my closest friends to this day is Paul Sparrow [see an alumni profile of Sparrow, page 30]. We grew up together and spent our high school years on Long Island, NY, fantasizing about "going to California." Paul went to UC Santa Cruz, and I became a goldsmith working in Carmel Valley and commuting from Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Robin Lewin (Kresge '79, communications and music) and Larry Tyrrell (Porter '80, aesthetic studies/music) also lived in our Swift St. house. Lewin is a video producer in Los Angeles today. He was a disc jockey and station manager at KZSC from 1976&#8211;79. Tyrrell is a world-famous Shakuhachi flutist living in Portland.</p>
<p>As for Julie, she is now Julie Morrison, and has been with me for the past 38 years. Her dedication to the type of education she received at UC Santa Cruz has served her well, and she has passed it on to our two boys.</p>
<p>Our sons' academic and professional success is completely (in my humble view) due to the ethos, flexibility, and support of disciplined passion that Julie experienced at UC Santa Cruz. She passed this type of value on to our sons as their coach and mentor regarding the importance and essence of attending a great school, with outstanding professors, and enjoying the process, while it moves them forward toward their dreams and goals in life.</p>
<p>My deepest thanks, appreciation, and gratitude to a great institution of learning and all you have contributed to my friends and my family.</p>

<h3>Thanks for the memories</h3>
<p>What a great surprise it was to find in my mailbox an issue of UC Santa Cruz Review tracing its first 50 years. I'm glad you found me. The issue brought back a veritable flood of memories.</p>
<p>I was a busboy in the Pogonip Polo Club (as it was called then) around '65 when ground was just beginning to be broken on the rolling green grassy hills above the club. I remember we were all a little wary about the action and what the consequences would be from this pretty serious ecological disturbance. These were hills we had grown up in, and on, after all. Looking back of course, the jewel that UC Santa Cruz became erased any qualms or misgivings I had.</p>
<p>Two years later, on weeknights during the school year, a friend and I would pedal our 10-speeds after dinner from Live Oak all the way up the excruciating grade to the campus, to while away the evening hours doing our homework at McHenry Library. As high school students still, we found it awe inspiring to wander around that majestic edifice, in and out of the stacks, until we found our private corner to set up camp&#8212;at which time, totally to our surprise, as well as that of our parents, we found ourselves far more able to study there than anywhere else we had stumbled onto to that point. Of course it did not hurt, in fact it was an added perk, to be able to coast at death-defying speeds back down that grade, in the moonlit night back into Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In '73 I found myself a student at Stevenson College in my junior year. I would purposely schedule my day around classes, making sure to park at the bottom of the hill at the entrance. This would enable me to hike through what surely must have been the most verdant and untouched, wild even, grounds of any university of UC Santa Cruz's stature. If I allotted enough time, I might be lucky enough to find some of my favorite redwood clusters unoccupied, and so would sit, meditate, and play my new silver flute. It somehow always prepared me, grounded and rounded out the experience I would have subsequently in class.</p>
<p>During that same year one of my favorite courses was Birth of a Poet, taught by that old rascal bard William (Bill) Everson, who, years later, became my friend and mentor, although I have counted many others as mentors as well. But Brother Antoninus, n&#233; William Everson, was special. Bill would hold forth in a mesmerizing extemporaneous fashion befitting a poet of his talent, while I and other ragtag students lay on the dirt floor of the geodesic dome on the College Five campus that served as Bill's classroom. He hypnotized us with his eloquence, his way of speaking. Our assignment was to keep a journal of our dreams.</p>
<p>I saw Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta speak for the United Farm Workers in the Quarry. I had a class there, I think it was The Anthropology of Religion. There were many small musical events held there. I once fell off a skateboard in the Quarry parking lot, creating a permanent floating bone fragment in my elbow. Please, please, please bring back the Quarry! It was something of a shock to hear of its closure.</p>
<p>Thank you so much again for finding me.</p>

<h3>A time of flux and fire</h3>
<p>I am a 1971 graduate of Cowell College, and I was struck by your recent article about the early years at UC Santa Cruz ["<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/03/rev-spring-15-original-vision.html">Original vision</a>"].</p>
<p>I cherish my college education, especially the relationships with the likes of Tom Vogler, George Amos, Marshall Leicester, and Norman O. Brown. They provided rich stimulation in an unprecedented academic atmosphere.</p>
<p>But there was more to our college experience than intellectual exploration. There was a backdrop of doubt, fear, and anger. The war and the threat of conscription weighed heavily on many of us, and we found ourselves confronting the values of our parents, who had sacrificed everything to defend the very freedoms that we challenged. Generations were torn apart. It was a time of flux and fire.</p>
<p>Add to this the widespread drug culture, which started out as fun, but led to the inevitable collision with real responsibilities.</p>
<p>The physical and cultural isolation of UC Santa Cruz raised doubts about the privileges that allowed us to be there at all.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful time to be young, but moral, social, and political confusion took some of the edge off the flossy magic that you describe.</p>

<p>Alumni descended upon UC Santa Cruz in unprecedented numbers for UC Santa Cruz's 50th anniversary Alumni Weekend in April.

<p>And you brought your kids.</p>
<p>Children were here&#8212;kids of all ages, from babes in arms to toddlers and grade-schoolers. They were as adorable and fresh-faced as you can imagine. I also saw some high school kids hanging out near the photo booth and taking in the views.</p>
<p>I got to campus early Saturday to help set up the Banana Slug Kid Zone, where there were crafts, snacks, and fun stuff for the little ones. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, but kids showed up, chased each other and made Play-Doh renditions of Sammy the Slug.</p>
<p>These children were being exposed to a college campus and seeing their parents being active alumni, attending lectures and thought-provoking panels, enjoying festivities, and connecting with a network of friends and supporters.</p>
<p>This seems like an invaluable gift.</p>

<p>These children were being exposed to a college campus and seeing their parents being active alumni, attending lectures and thought-provoking panels, enjoying festivities, and connecting with a network of friends and supporters.</p>
<p>This seems like an invaluable gift. College is not for everyone, and there are certainly other routes to success and fulfillment in life.</p>
<p>But when I looked at the faces of those beautiful kids at Alumni Weekend, I felt like they were already being encouraged to become their best, most authentic selves&#8212;just by being there, being exposed to ideas, intellect, friendship, tradition, knowledge, creative expression, and the unabashed eccentricity that is the hallmark of UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>I thought, as they darted between the redwoods and babbled during lectures, that those children might be observing their parents and feeling like college is a place that can open the mind, expand the heart, and teach life lessons from the divine to the mundane.</p>
<p>I hope I'll see those kids at future Alumni Weekends. But I wouldn't be surprised if, in 10 or 15 years, I also see a few of them in a classroom on campus.</p>

<h3>Dressing up to party down</h3>
<p>In January, the campus kicked off its 50th birthday year with a fashion flourish with "Dress Like It's 1965 Day." Staff, faculty, students, and community members participated&#8212;and had a blast (from the past)! Outfits were judged by <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/10/review-fall-2010-madmen.html"><em>Mad Men</em> Co-Costume Designer Tiffany White Stanton</a> (Kresge '03, psychology). <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/kick-off">Check out the photos</a>.</p>
<h3>Alumni bash</h3>
<p>A record-breaking crowd of revelers took part in a special 50th anniversary Alumni Weekend. The buzz about returning for next year's reunion filled Cowell Courtyard. Plans for Alumni Weekend 2016 (April 29&#8211;May 1) are already underway. The party gets better every year!</p>

Callow)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute has taken on a new managing director, Ravi Jain, to serve alongside scientific director<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/haussler" target="_self">David Haussler</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>and oversee the institute's strategic planning, business development, and operations, among other responsibilities.</p>
<p>Jain comes to UC Santa Cruz after serving as president and CEO of cBio, a software development and bioinformatics consulting firm he co-founded. He holds a Ph.D. in molecular evolution from UCLA.</p>
<p>"As managing director, Ravi will play a major role in the development and growth of the Genomics Institute," Haussler said. "He will lead us as we take on the many challenges associated with developing the global platform for genomics&#8212;as we coordinate, analyze, and make available the volumes of sequencing data and related clinical information generated by genomic projects from around the world."</p>
<p>Jain's experience at cBio relates directly to this new role. With its mission of enhancing public health, cBio applied bioinformatics to problems of microbial diagnostics and biosurveillance, including processing, analyzing, and visualizing data from multiple next-generation sequencing platforms.</p>
<p>"The Genomics Institute is an important initiative at UC Santa Cruz, building upon our successes in the human genome project and applying them to many important problems, including precision medicine and cancer treatment," said Scott Brandt, vice chancellor of research. "Dr. Jain&#8217;s solid scientific and business experience will help elevate UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s genomics efforts to the next level."</p>
<p>"The UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute has brought a global set of players together and leveraged its own strengths in the computational arena to help deliver better treatment options to patients," said Jain. "With its legacy of performance in the area of genomics and specifically in medical genomics, the institute is poised to revolutionize cancer treatment."</p>
<p>Jain said he looks forward to meeting the community and welcomes interested people to contact him (email<span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span><a href="mailto:ravij@ucsc.edu" target="_blank">ravij@ucsc.edu</a>) and get involved with the genomics institute.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6c17e3578072701704d605cbabf1bc53"><name>rev-fall-15-this-is-ucsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>This is UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>News roundup from UC Santa Cruz in the fall '15 UC Santa Cruz Review</summary><start-date>1440572400000</start-date><display-name>BThis is UC Santa Cruz</display-name><path>/2015/08/rev-fall-15-this-is-ucsc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/rev-fall-15-this-is-ucsc</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1440627548991</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1441996295594</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><h3>Sharing the universe</h3>
<p><img align="right" alt="Purevdorj Davaa, who partnered with UC Santa Cruz astronomy grad student Tuguldur Sukhbold on a project to bring telescopes to 44 schools in Mongolia, drives across the steppes on a delivery run. (Photo by Enkhbat)" height="253" src="images/telescope-delivery.jpg" width="380"/>For UC Santa Cruz grad student Tuguldur Sukhbold, doing advanced research in astrophysics on the wooded campus of Santa Cruz is a long way from his native country of Mongolia, where he had to build his own telescopes.</p>
<p>Opportunities he got at UC Santa Cruz allowed him to organize a project that, last year, delivered telescopes to 7 percent of the schools in Mongolia&#8212;44 in all&#8212;so that science-starved kids might be exposed to the wonders of the universe.</p>
<p>"A lot of these kids will probably never travel to another country, or even travel to a city," said Tuguldur of a country where horses outnumber people and where science education has lagged in the past 20 years. "Their world view is very limited. But with these telescopes, even if they can't see the world, they can see the universe."</p>
<h3>Professor Hershatter joins American Academy</h3>
<p><img align="right" alt="History Professor Gail Hershatter (photo by C. Lagattuta)" height="253" src="images/hershatter-gail.jpg" width="380"/>UC Santa Cruz History Professor Gail Hershatter has joined Nobel Prize&#8211;winning chemist Brian Kobilka, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, singer-songwriter Judy Collins, novelist Tom Wolfe, and UC President Janet A. Napolitano as a newly elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>The 2015 class of 197 includes some of the world's most accomplished scholars, scientists, writers, artists, and civic, business, and philanthropic leaders.</p>
<p>One of the nation's most prestigious honorary societies, the American Academy is also a leading center for independent policy research.</p>
<p>Members contribute to Academy publications and studies of science and technology policy, the arts and humanities, international affairs and global security, social policy, and education.</p>
<p>Hershatter was recognized for her contributions to the field of history. She is best known for her pioneering field research and oral history among Chinese women, and for her major contributions to the history of women, labor, and sexuality.</p>
<h3>Changing climate of climate change talk</h3>
<p>Most of the discussion at the second annual UC Santa Cruz Climate &amp; Policy Conference in March was not about how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but about how to plan for and adapt to the inevitable consequences of those emissions, which are already changing the climate.</p>
<p>In his keynote speech, Penn State geologist Richard Alley provided a compelling overview of how our society's reliance on fossil fuels for energy is driving climate change, and he described how costly the impacts of global warming will be, in both economic and human terms. Alley also made the case that the technology is available now to make the transition to a sustainable energy system, and that it makes sense economically to do so.</p>
<p>"If you just look at dollars and cents, the economy is still better if we start to wisely reduce our use of fossil fuels," Alley said. "Dealing with it makes us better off&#8212;it gives us a stronger economy and more jobs."</p>
<h3>Progress in AIDS vaccine research</h3>
<p>Phil Berman has been working to develop an AIDS vaccine for nearly 30 years, first at the pioneering biotech company Genentech, then as cofounder of VaxGen, and now at UC Santa Cruz, where he is the Baskin Professor of Biomolecular Engineering. Since his arrival at UC Santa Cruz in 2006, Berman has established a major vaccine research effort funded by a series of grants from the National Institutes of Health, including two new grants in 2014 totaling $2.6 million.</p>
<p>The latest results from this effort have Berman sounding optimistic about the prospects for a vaccine that can be effective in protecting against HIV infection. His lab has developed new vaccine candidates that he said are promising enough to consider advancing into clinical trials within the next two years.</p>
<h3>Science? Or science fiction?</h3>
<p><img align="right" alt="Beth Shapiro" height="379" src="images/bethshapiro.png" width="493"/>Tired of answering questions about cloning mammoths, Beth Shapiro, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, wrote a book called <em>How to Clone a Mammoth.</em> (Spoiler alert: You can't actually clone a mammoth.)</p>
<p>Shapiro is a leading authority on ancient DNA&#8212;how to recover it from fossils, museum specimens, and prehistoric remains buried in frozen tundra, and how to analyze it for clues to the evolutionary history of species and populations, both living and extinct. She has studied DNA from ancient populations of bears, horses, humans, and, yes, mammoths. But she is not a big proponent of "de-extinction"&#8212;the idea that scientists could use ancient DNA to recreate extinct species.</p>
<p>In <em>How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction,</em> Shapiro addresses the scientific and ethical challenges that would confront any effort to bring back extinct creatures.</p>
<p>"I question if it's something we should do at all, for many ethical and environmental reasons," Shapiro said. "I'm trying to separate the science from the science fiction."</p>
<h3>Sleuthing a killer shrub</h3>
<p>Wading her way through dense thickets of Scotch broom in Washington State, Jennifer Thompson, 22, realized just how damaging the plant could be.</p>
<p>Growing up to 12 feet in height, the perennial shrub with its bright yellow flowers had overrun land once filled with Douglas fir. But what was most interesting to Thompson was the fact that, even if all the Scotch broom were removed, the Douglas fir would most likely not regrow.</p>
<p>Thanks to a grant from UC Santa Cruz's Dean's Fund for Undergraduate Research and to Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Ingrid Parker, Thompson (Cowell '15, plant sciences) spent a year doing research into the question of why the Scotch broom was so toxic to Douglas fir.</p>
<p>Thompson's work is emblematic of a UC Santa Cruz ethos grounded in the founding days of the university: the opportunity for undergraduates to take part in research. In fact, a 2014 study conducted by the uni-versity found 73 percent of graduating seniors had assisted in faculty research or creative projects during their time at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<h3>The rewards of research</h3>
<p><img align="right" alt="Sanjin Mehic (photo by C. Lagattuta)" height="380" src="images/mehic-sanjin.jpg" width="253"/>Sanjin Mehic's parents left everything behind when they fled war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina for the quieter streets of San Jose, Calif.</p>
<p>"My parents worked hard to get going and never looked back," said Mehic (Porter '16, biochemistry and molecular biology).</p>
<p>For Mehic, 24, that industriousness shaped his own life. Mehic is engaged in a research study that focuses on the role of bacteria in the production of an algal toxin called domoic acid in the Monterey Bay. Domoic acid not only kills marine organisms but also can cause neurological damage, sometimes fatal, in humans.</p>
<p>Thanks to Assistant Professor of Ocean Sciences Marilou Sison-Mangus and a grant from the Dean's Fund for Undergraduate Research, Mehic is studying whether certain bacteria influence production of domoic acid during algal blooms.</p>
<h3>Holy bacteria!</h3>
<p>Bacteria found naturally on some bats may prove useful in controlling the deadly fungal disease known as white-nose syndrome, which has devastated bat populations throughout eastern North America and continues to spread across the continent.</p>
<p>Scientists at UC Santa Cruz isolated bacteria that strongly inhibited the growth of the white-nose syndrome fungus in laboratory tests.</p>
<p>Experiments are now in progress to see if treating bats with the bacteria can protect them from the disease, said Joseph Hoyt, a UC Santa Cruz graduate student who led the study.</p>
<h3>Historic structure is 'barn again'</h3>
<p><img align="right" alt="Hay Barn (photo by G. Lasnier)" height="285" src="images/hay-barn.jpg" width="380"/>The Cowell Ranch Hay Barn at the base of the UC Santa Cruz campus is being "barn again."</p>
<p>The structure is being rebuilt as a center for UC Santa Cruz's environmental and sustainability programs and will become the home of the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems and a campus and community hub.</p>
<p>The project, made possible by a $5 million gift from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation, supports the Coastal Sustainability initiative of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>When a weather-tight exterior is finished, the barn will contain a large multipurpose space for exhibitions, assemblies, barn dances, and more, along with a conference room, restrooms, and utility rooms. A future phase&#8212;still to be funded&#8212;will add other conference rooms, kitchenette, and exterior improvements.</p>
<p>The rebuilding will be celebrated with an event on Sept. 12. The doors of the barn will be opened at 7 p.m. and the community welcomed to an evening of lively music and refreshments.</p>
<h3>The search for life</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz astrophysicist Jonathan Fortney is one of 15 principal investigators for a NASA initiative that is embracing a team approach to the quest for life on planets around other stars. The Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) will benefit from the expertise of several dozen scientists across the NASA science community in an effort to find clues to life on faraway worlds.</p>
<p>Fortney, an associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, will lead a team exploring how novel statistical methods can be used to extract information from the light emitted and reflected by planetary atmospheres in order to understand their atmospheric temperatures and the abundance of molecules.</p>
<p>Astronomers routinely analyze the light from distant stars by spreading it out into a spectrum of different wavelengths. Fortney is developing tools for analyzing the spectra of distant planets to determine molecular abundances in their atmospheres.</p>
<h3>Ancient Egypt in 3D</h3>
<p>Assistant Professor of History Elaine Sullivan received a Digital Start-Up Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to develop a three-dimensional model and virtual tour that will demonstrate how an ancient Egyptian site evolved over more than 3,000 years.</p>
<p>The $47,200 grant was one of 17 awards directed to development of new digital tools for study of the humanities that are part of a larger slate of 232 grants announced by the NEH.</p>
<p>Sullivan is co-principal investigator of a Digital Humanities Research Cluster funded by the Institute for Humanities Research (IHR) at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"I think of digital humanities as using new technologies to answer questions I can't answer now&#8212;opening up new realms of scholarship," said Sullivan.</p>
<h3>Anita Hill speaks truth to power</h3>
<p><img align="right" alt="Anita Hill (photo courtesy Brandeis University)" height="254" src="images/hill-anita.jpg" width="380"/>Anita Hill's life changed forever in 1991 when a television audience of 22 million saw her testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Judge Clarence Thomas.</p>
<p>Her calm demeanor&#8212;as she was pressed to endlessly repeat the graphic descriptions of sexual harassment she endured while working for Thomas&#8212;struck a chord with the public and began a conversation about sexual harassment and power in the workplace that still resonates today.</p>
<p>Now an author and professor of law, public policy, and women's studies at Brandeis University, Hill came to UC Santa Cruz in February to deliver a free public lecture on the topic: "Speaking Truth to Power: Gender and Racial Equality, 1991&#8211;2015."</p>
<p>In a telephone interview from her office in Boston, Hill recalled the groundbreaking hearings that took place 23 years ago in Congress.</p>
<p>"The experience itself was surreal beyond anything that I think anybody could have prepared for," said Hill.</p>
<h3>Short stands tall</h3>
<p><em>Last Day of Freedom</em>&#8212;an animated short by UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Art Dee Hibbert-Jones and San Francisco artist Nomi Talisman&#8212;was honored with two awards at the 18th annual Full Frame Documentary Film Festival.</p>
<p>It received the Jury Award for "Best Short," qualifying the film for a possible nomination for an Academy Award next year in the category of "Best Documentary (Short Subject)."</p>
<p>In choosing <em>Last Day of Freedom</em> for the award, the festival judges noted: "This film demonstrates and reminds us of the simple power and intimacy of the human voice. It interweaves different visual styles of animation and engages the audience fully in an increasingly fraught tale that ultimately presents the supreme cost of doing the right thing."</p>
<p>The short blends animation with poignant testimony to create a haunting story of a man who discovers his brother has committed a serious crime.</p>
<h3>Fighting cultural amnesia</h3>
<p><em>Splinters in Our Ankles</em> is UC Santa Cruz Theater Arts Professor Gerald Casel's choreographic response to what he calls "the collective cultural amnesia" about the Philippine national dance.</p>
<p>Born in the Philippines and raised in California, Casel actually grew up with little knowledge of the popular dance.</p>
<p>But recently, his research took him back to the Philippines to dig into the historical context of the national dance, which originated during the Spanish colonial occupation of the Philippines that began in the 16th century.</p>
<p>"As a choreographer, I question the most famous and beloved traditional dance, <em>Tinikling,</em> and why it is represented in such a lively and festive way," said Casel. "I argue that during the time it was being created, Filipinos were under Spanish colonial rule&#8212;a violent past that is not discussed when this dance is presented.</p>
<p>"I wanted to shed a light on this omission as 'cultural amnesia' to convey an alternative lens through which Filipino bodies can be represented and therefore not easily 'exoticized' and easily 'consumed' for entertainment."</p>
<h3>The book of 'rad women'</h3>
<p><img align="right" alt="Kate Schatz (Stevenson '01, women's studies and creative writing)" height="380" src="images/schatz-kate.jpg" width="285"/>"American history is filled with stories of brave and powerful men, but have you ever wondered where the women are?"</p>
<p>So begins <em>Rad American Women A-Z: Rebels, Trailblazers, and Visionaries Who Shaped Our History&#8230;And Our Future,</em> a book for kids by alumna Kate Schatz (Stevenson '01, women's studies and creative writing).</p>
<p>It features the stories of 26 women who have had a major impact on American life&#8212;from artists and abolitionists, to scientists and sports heroes, to rock stars and writers.</p>
<p>It also has the distinction of being the first children's book published by San Francisco's famed City Lights Publishers in the company's 60-year history. In May, the book debuted at No. 5 on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list.</p>
<h3>Setting up for success</h3>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz men's volleyball team spent its season honing sets and kills, doing conditioning, and watching game film. Team members also sold donuts and athletic gear, worked on their r&#233;sum&#233;s, and picked up trash on the beach.</p>
<p>The unusual regimen was born not just from the financially strapped squad's need to raise money in order to compete, but also from Head Coach Todd Hollenbeck's decision to approach this team in a new way: by building solid human beings first, both on the court and in life.</p>
<p>"It's not about wins and losses," said Hollenbeck. "It's how can we score points when we're not even touching the ball. We do that in the classroom, in applying for a job, and by volunteering."</p>
<p>The team ended the season with a 24-6 record and earned a visit to the NCAA Division III national championships in Hoboken, N.J.</p>
<h3>Ph.D. thesis to philanthropy</h3>
<p>Alumnus Sage Weil (Ph.D. '07, computer science), who developed his thesis project into the highly successful open-source software data storage system Ceph, has given UC Santa Cruz $2.5 million to support research in open-source software.</p>
<p>Weil's gift supports a faculty chair in open-source software and research led by Professor of Computer Science Carlos Maltzahn, who directs the Center for Research in Open Source Software at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Sage was a brilliant student and a serial entrepreneur even before he came here," said Scott Brandt, professor of computer science and now vice chancellor for research at UC Santa Cruz. "It's great to see one of our students succeed in such a visible way, and then for him to give back to us in this way is just extraordinary."</p>
<p>The gift supports the Data Science Leadership initiative at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>A private firm named Celera Genomics was beating a path to the prize with a big budget and what was reported to be the most powerful computer cluster in civilian use.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an international consortium of public scientists&#8212;which Haussler had only recently been invited to join&#8212;was lagging behind.</p>
<p>The public institutions assigned to write a program that would assemble the 600,000 fragments of DNA the consortium had decoded into a comprehensible sequence were having trouble. On top of that, the heads of Celera Genomics and the public consortium had agreed to jointly announce the results of their work at the White House on June 26. The deadline was approaching like a speeding bullet.</p>
<p>What happened next was the stuff of movies, and also a reflection of the kind of maverick, can-do ethos that has pervaded UC Santa Cruz for all of its 50-year history.</p>
<p>Haussler, a tall man with a penchant for Hawaiian shirts, managed to wrangle 100 Dell Pentium III processor workstations&#8212;each with less power than one of today's smart phones&#8212;and assemble a makeshift "supercomputer." He then started a behind-the-scenes attempt to write an assembly program. The going was slow, however.</p>
<p>Enter Jim Kent, an unruly-haired UC Santa Cruz graduate student in molecular, cell, and developmental biology. He worried that if a private corporation sequenced the human genome first, thousands of genes might be patented&#8212;meaning that, for a time at least, "open science" would have meant "open only to those who could pay."</p>
<p>On May 22, Kent, who'd cut his coding teeth in the commercial world of paint and animation programming, e-mailed Haussler saying he thought he had found a way to write an assembly program using a simpler strategy.</p>
<p>Haussler replied with one word: "Godspeed."</p>
<p>"So Jim went for it," Haussler said. "It was a classic scene. I knew Jim was a genius and I thought, 'It may be hopeless but, at this point, what have we got to lose?' Celera had one of the most powerful computer systems at the time, and we, basically, had 100 cell phones."</p>
<p>Kent spent the next month huddled in the garage office at his Seabright home, writing 10,000 lines of code so furiously and for so many hours, he had to ice his wrists.</p>
<p>On June 22, four days before the White House announcement&#8212;and three days before Celera finished its computer assembly&#8212;Kent ran the first successful draft sequence of the human genome using the UC Santa Cruz computer farm and 13 sets of data sources.</p>
<p>The announcement of the successful sequencing of the human genome was hailed around the world.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, on July 7, Haussler and Kent had the honor of posting the first human genome on the Internet. In September, they also debuted the UCSC Genome Browser, a graphic web-based "microscope" for exploring the human genome that continues to be free to anyone who wants it.</p>
<p>Today, thousands of biomedical researchers worldwide use the UCSC Genome Browser in their work to uncover the causes of disease and develop treatments. The browser has been mentioned in more than 20,000 different scholarly papers in biomedical literature, an indication of its impact in disease research. The site gets about a million hits per day.</p>
<p>It was an audacious achievement but not the only time UC Santa Cruz has beaten the odds to make a difference. From saving falcons to peering into the universe and putting organic food on American tables, UC Santa Cruz has become known as the small university where big things happen.</p>
<p>Here are just a few examples.</p>
<h3>Bring back the birds</h3>
<p>Peregrine falcons are the F-16s of nature. They can dive to speeds of up to 300 mph, snatch other birds out of mid-air, and have a ratcheting function in their feet that allows them to lock onto prey and hold it with very little energy.</p>
<p>But by 1970, there were only two breeding pairs left in California thanks to the pesticide DDT, which thinned the shells of the falcons' eggs, causing them to break under the weight of the nesting adult.</p>
<p>Today, there are nearly 300 productive pairs of the iconic bird, and their return is due in large part to a seat-of-the-pants organization started in 1975 on the UC Santa Cruz campus by the late Natural History Professor Ken Norris.</p>
<p>Like Haussler, the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, as it was known, had to MacGyver its way to success. Led by a tireless scientific researcher named Brian Walton, the group sent climbers up rock walls with homemade plywood backpacks to retrieve falcon eggs, which they would replace with fake eggs created by the UC Santa Cruz Art Department.</p>
<p>According to Glenn Stewart, now director of the program, the falcon eggs would then be transported by volunteers to the research group's makeshift headquarters in the Lower Quarry&#8212;which Norris had threatened to power with the "world's longest extension cord" until administrators agreed to supply electricity to the site. There, the eggs would be hatched in modified chicken incubators and the chicks warmed on heating pads placed in cement-mixing tubs. The birds would be fed with ground pigeon or quail meat raised by staff and volunteers, watched 24/7 by program employees and students, and finally transported back to the nest for their "rebirth," often to the surprise of their avian parents.</p>
<p>By 1999, the peregrine falcon had recovered enough to be removed from the federal endangered species list.</p>
<p>It was an impudent fight, headquartered on a campus known mostly for its lack of grades, and one that included a lot of improvisation, more than a few bent rules, and even the threat of arrest. (One volunteer was swarmed by a Los Angeles SWAT team while trying to capture pigeons from a freeway billboard in order to supplement the program's food budget.)</p>
<p>"It's one of the greatest environmental success stories of all time," Stewart said.</p>
<h3>In a galaxy&#8230;</h3>
<p>About the same time the peregrine falcon population was taking flight, a group of scientists from UC Santa Cruz were revolutionizing the way we studied the heavens.</p>
<p>Two physicists, Jerry Nelson and Terry Mast, had recently arrived on campus from UC Berkeley. The two had conceived a radical telescope design that used segmented, hexagonal mirrors to peer more deeply into space than ever before. The result was a multimillion-dollar project to build two of these breakthrough 10-meter telescopes on the slopes of Mauna Kea in Hawaii.</p>
<p>In order to work, the telescopes also needed precisely crafted secondary mirrors, and, even though a few outside companies could make them, UC Santa Cruz scientists decided to tackle the difficult assignment themselves.</p>
<p>Then&#8211;professor of astronomy Joe Miller remembered: "I said, 'We've got the well-equipped optical laboratory, a very experienced and great optician (Dave Hilyard), and superb support from Jerry Nelson, Terry Mast, and Harland Epps, who is the leading designer of astronomical optics in the U.S.'"</p>
<p>Today, the twin Keck telescopes use secondary mirrors built in a series of unassuming metal-roofed shops amid the redwoods of UC Santa Cruz. The Kecks are considered the most productive telescopes in the world.</p>
<p>Their success also inspired a new effort to build a 30-meter version of the Keck telescopes&#8212;an international endeavor with roots still deep in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>But secondary mirrors were not the only instruments born amid the woods. Instruments conceived by astronomer Steven Vogt and by National Medal of Science winner Sandra Faber have allowed researchers to discover scores of extrasolar planets, find direct evidence for the Hot Big Bang theory, and make major progress in mapping the evolution of the universe for the last 5 billion years.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was also at the vanguard of adaptive optics, technological advances that combat atmospheric distortion so the images scientists see through telescopes are sharp and clear.</p>
<p>"We've developed and built these absolutely forefront instruments," said Michael Bolte, UC Santa Cruz professor of astronomy and astrophysics, sitting in his campus office underneath a photo of one of the Keck telescopes. "The place where it all happened is right here."</p>
<h3>Lights, science, action</h3>
<p>Down the hill and a few years earlier, a couple of research biologists and confessed seabird freaks from UC Santa Cruz embarked on a mission that would grow to save 389 species from possible extinction on more than four dozen islands in the world.</p>
<p>It was the 1980s, and Don Croll and Bernie Tershy had loaded up their surfboards and headed to a pair of wind-wracked Mexican islands where feral cats were obliterating Cassin's Auklets, Scripps's Murrelets, and Black Storm-petrels.</p>
<p>The men knew what was happening on those specks of land was emblematic of a larger problem: Nowhere were extinctions greater than on the world's islands, home to 20 percent of bird, reptile, and plant species.</p>
<p>With the help of a legendary bobcat trapper, the determined but underfunded environmental tacticians went to work, managing to clear the islands of the destructive felines. Within five years, the two assembled a rag-tag team of graduate students, trappers, and Mexican conservationists, freeing nine islands off of Baja California of invasive rats, feral cats, rabbits, goats, and burros&#8212;allowing native birds and plants to return. They turned the group into a nonprofit called Island Conservation and established its headquarters in a rented space on the UC Santa Cruz marine-lab campus.</p>
<p>Today, Island Conservation is an independent, Santa Cruz&#8211;based nonprofit with a $6.5 million budget and projects around the world.</p>
<p>"To us, it was: Why apply science just to describe problems?" Croll said. "Using science to find solutions seemed way more interesting."</p>
<p>It was a culture born from early faculty like Michael Soul&#233;, a professor of environmental sciences known as the father of modern conservation biology, and the late Ken Norris, a UC Santa Cruz natural history professor who not only helped craft the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 but also co-founded the 756,000-acre UC Natural Reserve System, according to Croll.</p>
<p>Since then, the UC Santa Cruz researchers have helped bring about policy changes like a West Coast ban on fishing for krill, shrimp-like crustaceans that are a major food source for marine life, and are now working with postdoc Asha de Vos to examine a possible modification of shipping lanes that could help save Sri Lankan blue whales. Their students have helped stop construction of a liquefied natural gas plant in an environmentally sensitive area of Mexico and supported modification of rules so oil-spill money for seabird restoration can be used beyond spill boundaries to places the winged victims travel and breed.</p>
<p>"The ethos of this place is to encourage people to go out and do things," Croll said.</p>
<h3>Beyond bars</h3>
<p>When Psychology Professor Craig Haney arrived in Santa Cruz in 1977, he'd already witnessed the psychological damage prison could cause.</p>
<p>He had been one of the principal researchers in the famous Stanford Prison Experiment, which had student volunteers playing the roles of guards and inmates in a simulated prison setting, and which had to be halted because of the psychological mistreatment and breakdowns that ensued.</p>
<p>But now Haney found himself in the real world of prisons, talking to inmates in windowless solitary confinement cells where the smells of 23-hour-a-day living and a sense of grief created an almost palpable heaviness in the air.</p>
<p>He witnessed prisoners break under the pressures of isolation and documented how others clung to slivers of humanity by imposing an almost obsessive order on their solitary lives. He saw inmates transition from a fear of being alone to apprehension about being around people, and chronicled the rise of the use of isolation in prisons around the country.</p>
<p>In 2012, he told a U.S. Senate subcommittee that, for many inmates, "solitary confinement precipitates a descent into madness."</p>
<p>Haney's four decades of prison research has taken him from frightening prisons in Texas to medieval-looking facilities in Pennsylvania and to a federal supermax prison in Colorado. In California he saw men packed into a sweltering gymnasium with bunks stacked three high as armed guards patrolled catwalks above them.</p>
<p>"Men were living not for weeks or months but for years in these abysmally overcrowded, dangerous, and unhealthy environments," he said.</p>
<p>In 2011, Haney's testimony about the psychological effects of this kind of treatment became the cornerstone for a U.S. Supreme Court decision that forced California to reduce its prison populations because of cruel and inhumane conditions.</p>
<p>Sitting in his office in advance of a CNN interview about solitary confinement, Haney reflected on his work both inside and outside the university.</p>
<p>"I think when you see injustices that other people haven't, it's important to communicate those observations beyond an academic world," Haney said. "We have an obligation to share knowledge not just with students but with a larger society. Especially when that knowledge bears directly on things about which the public should know and care about."</p>
<h3>The past is present</h3>
<p>If you want to know about climate change, you may want to look deep into the Earth. That's what Christina Ravelo, UC Santa Cruz professor of ocean sciences, has done, and what she discovered has rattled the way scientists go about predicting the effects of climate shifts.</p>
<p>Ravelo, a paleoclimatologist with a shock of dark, curling hair, has spent countless hours studying sediment cores harvested from deep beneath the ocean in hopes the past would shed clues on the present. Her interest is in an epoch known as the Pliocene Warm Period 3.5 to 4.5 million years ago, when temperatures were a few degrees higher and CO2 levels roughly the same as today.</p>
<p>What she discovered was evidence of a permanent El Ni&#241;o&#8211;like state in the tropics with its resulting drought, floods, and damaging storms. Her discovery shook the scientific community because modern climate-prediction models did not forecast that kind of result.</p>
<p>"The issue has fueled a lot of debate and a lot of scrutiny about how Earth responds to high CO2 levels," said Ravelo. "There may be even more radical changes that the models aren't picking up yet because we haven't been able to simulate a tropical climate accurately. We're trying to figure out why the models and the data from the Pliocene don't agree."</p>
<p>Her findings, along with those made by her colleague Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences Jim Zachos, and her use of a laser system to analyze the geochemistry of fossils in order to understand climate and ocean dynamics, has put her&#8212;and UC Santa Cruz&#8212;on the forefront of climate research.</p>
<h3>Seed to table</h3>
<p>If you've ever picked up a carton of organic strawberries from your local supermarket, you have an eccentric English gardener, a passionate farmer/plant ecologist, and UC Santa Cruz to thank.</p>
<p>The odyssey of those strawberries began in 1967 when a quirky master gardener named Alan Chadwick arrived at UC Santa Cruz. Tasked with creating a student garden, Chadwick and a host of young acolytes grabbed digging fork and spade, and soon turned a rocky hillside on the upper campus into a garden overflowing with flowers and vegetables. His technique, which he called the French Intensive Biodynamic method, would come to lay the groundwork for organic gardens around the world.</p>
<p>But by 1981, Chadwick had left, and a campus farm born out of that first garden was struggling under a financial drought. Things looked bleak until an enthusiastic plant ecologist and farmer who'd just come from southern Mexico, where he'd worked the soil using traditional farming systems, arrived on campus. His name was Steve Gliessman.</p>
<p>Hired to teach a spring natural history field quarter, Gliessman was also asked to revive the struggling UC Santa Cruz Farm. His idea was to tie the Farm to academics in a science he called agroecology&#8212;the application of ecological principles to agriculture as opposed to factory farms' reliance on chemicals and what he saw as unsustainable practices.</p>
<p>Cobbling funds from philanthropist Alfred Heller and a state program that generated money from custom license plate sales, Gliessman turned the Farm into an outdoor classroom&#8212;the first formal academic agroecology program in the world and a program that would also help launch a movement that has changed the way America eats.</p>
<p>As part of the program, Gliessman and students began working with local farmer Jim Cochran in 1985 to study whether organic berry growing could be an economically viable venture.</p>
<p>The answer is evident in the organic produce grown by large-scale farms and sold in the likes of Safeways and Wal-Marts today.</p>
<p>"What we've done is call attention, on one hand, to the non-sustainability of the industrial approach to farming," said the now-retired Gliessman while sitting under the silvery branches of an olive tree he had planted years before at the campus's Sustainable Living Center. "And, on the other hand, we've developed a system of food health and justice from the soil to the people around the table."</p>
<h3>More greatest hits</h3>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned big ideas, UC Santa Cruz is responsible for an impressive list of other groundbreaking achievements, including the following.</p>
<p><strong>The Cancer Genomics Hub,</strong> built and operated by the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, is an essential resource for scientists studying cancer genomics data with the goal of developing targeted treatments against the disease. CGHub is the largest public database of cancer genome sequences in the world and the first "NIH Trusted Partner" authorized to distribute genome sequence data to biomedical researchers.</p>
<p><strong>By mapping, at the atomic level,</strong> the structure of the ribosome, a complex molecular machine found in all cells that translates the DNA molecular machine into functioning proteins, Harry Noller, professor of molecular biology at UC Santa Cruz, and his colleagues have helped provide a basis for the development of targeted antibiotics.</p>
<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz Professor</strong> of Anthropology Adrienne Zihlman's critique of the "Man the Hunter" model changed the idea that male-dominated activities like hunting were responsible for evolutionary adaptations like big brains. Her notion that female gathering activities could just as easily account for these adaptations was responsible for a shift in evolutionary perspective that is now mainstream.</p>

<p><strong>Extra: Read our&#160;<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/alice-waters-q-and-a.html">Q&amp;A with Alice Waters</a>.</strong></p>
<p>In 1971, Richard Nixon was president of the United States, Vietnam War protesters converged on Washington, D.C., and the <em>New York Times</em> caused a sensation when it published the Pentagon Papers.</p>
<p>During that turbulent year, a highly ambitious Francophile and food obsessive named Alice Waters, along with a group of idealistic friends, opened up a tiny restaurant in an Arts and Crafts house along Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley.</p>
<p>The restaurant was centered around organic, locally grown food, ecologically sound harvest methods, and environmental stewardship&#8212;concepts virtually unheard of at the time. On opening night, Waters wore a used polka-dot rayon dress from a neighborhood boutique called Bizarre Bazaar. She was crouched on the floor, nailing down a carpet, when the first curious diners wandered in. Little did she know that the restaurant would still be thriving more than four decades later&#8212;and considered one of the best in the world.</p>
<p>From this humble beginning, her restaurant became legendary, while Waters herself soon gained an international reputation&#8212;not just as a chef and cookbook author but a spokesperson for sustainable food, unafraid to take controversial positions that have made her critics label her everything from a food zealot to an "absolutist."</p>
<p>In advance of her visit to campus, Waters, who will receive the Foundation Medal during UC Santa Cruz's Founders Celebration Fiat Fifty dinner on September 26, spoke candidly with UC Santa Cruz Review about her career as a slow-food advocate, her life as a chef, her fight against the "fast-food nation," and her common cause with the ideas and mission of UC Santa Cruz's pioneering sustainable agriculture program.</p>
<h3>Fellow travelers</h3>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Farm, building on the success of UC Santa Cruz's Student Garden Project started by Master Gardener Alan Chadwick, was founded the same year as Chez Panisse. UC Santa Cruz's Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) offers a popular Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, an intensive organic farming and gardening training program (now in its 48th season) that has "seeded" the organic farming and food industry with a wealth of graduates.</p>
<p>Waters once visited with Chadwick himself while he was staying at the Green Gulch Farm near San Francisco. Waters has worked closely with several apprenticeship alumni from the UC Santa Cruz Farm, in both her restaurant as well as her Edible Schoolyard garden, where urban public school students learn to raise their own food.</p>
<p>"The UC Santa Cruz program really trains apprentices for farming in a very particular way so they can come and, immediately, become a teacher for young children," she said.</p>
<p>Waters also said that farm apprentices, such as the ones in UC Santa Cruz's program, are more important than ever these days because "young people are redefining what it means to be a farmer, and they are bringing us out to the country, and showing us the culture of agriculture."</p>
<p>In the process, these hard-working apprentices are building more of a community around farming, she said.</p>
<p>"Even in the '60s, organic farmers, if they weren't on a commune, were mom-and-pop operations&#8212;hard work, and pretty solitary," she said. "We've never elevated the farmer in this country. We've taken them for granted the same way we've taken our teachers for granted. Let's lift up the farmer and the teacher as the most important jobs of our country."</p>
<p>Chez Panisse and other like-minded restaurants have tried to do their part to "lift up the farmer" by listing the names of the farms that raised the food on their menus&#8212;a trend that has become so prevalent, it was spoofed on an episode of the satirical television show <em>Portlandia,</em> in which a diner got to meet the chicken he was about to eat.</p>
<p>Waters continues to embrace the idea of listing farm names because, in her view, it is a way not just of giving credit to the hard work of growers but forging a relationship built on transparency and honesty between the restaurant and its patrons. Diners, if they wish, could drive out and visit the farms themselves, she said.</p>
<p>She also spoke of the similar root systems of her restaurant and the UC Santa Cruz Farm program.</p>
<p>"We were really involved with <em>Diet for a Small Planet</em> in the '60s, and there was lots of dropping out (of the industrial food complex, which started in the 1950s) and growing your own," she said. "I felt that was a whole part of the hippie culture. At that time, there was this feeling: whatever you did, people would come and support it. I mean, we stopped the war in Vietnam. We had this strong sense of an idealistic world we could create ourselves."</p>
<p>It is that idealism, and that sense of adventure, that unites the mission of Alice Waters with the goals of CASFS, said Daniel Press, CASFS executive director and the Olga T. Griswold Professor of Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"If CASFS is the mothership of California organic agriculture, Alice Waters is the matriarch of California chefs," Press said. "UC Santa Cruz's Farm &amp; Garden and Chez Panisse both recognized early on the importance of sourcing food locally and establishing strong connections between growers, restaurants, local grocers, schools, and consumers.</p>
<p>"And of course, Alice Waters and CASFS have long insisted that our food should be grown in harmony with nature, based on sound agroecological principles, and with the strongest commitment to justice in our food systems," Press said.</p>
<h3>Articulate, humble, forceful</h3>
<p>Waters is an "articulate, humble, and forceful voice, speaking out at a time of a huge rise in food corporatization," said Amanda Rieux, a 1998 CASFS apprentice and one of the early garden teachers at the Edible Schoolyard. "The perspective Alice lends to the world is that everything about food matters&#8212;where it comes from, how it is grown, the variety, the season&#8212;that carefully engaged and loving attention to what we put in our bodies."</p>
<p>Rieux praised Waters for her strong emphasis on "educating the senses."</p>
<p>Growing, preparing, and tasting good food is a great way for children to engage with the world in an experiential way, regardless of economic background, she said.</p>
<p>"You can hone your senses and have a very rich life," said Rieux, who founded Mala'ai, a similar school garden/kitchen project at Waimea Middle School on the Big Island of Hawaii in 2005.</p>
<h3>Fringe to mainstream</h3>
<p>Since Waters started out, terms like "organic" have gone from fringe to ultra-mainstream.</p>
<p>This is encouraging, she said&#8212;though a little disarming at times. She finds it striking "that I am considered completely unusual," she said, even though, in her opinion, she's merely espousing "common sense."</p>
<p>She said that the fact that she stands out as much as she does suggests that "fast-food culture has really become the way people think, and it has changed the whole world."</p>
<p>But Waters is not at all hopeless about the future of good food in America. She is excited about efforts such as the UC Global Food Initiative, which aims to put UC campuses, the state, and the world on a pathway to sustainably and nutritiously feed themselves.</p>
<p>But the battle, she said, must be fought early on, and in the public school system, where children can learn to appreciate and grow high-quality food.</p>
<p>She is already doing this with her Edible Schoolyard Project, in which students at Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School in Berkeley use a one-acre organic garden and "kitchen classroom" to learn every aspect of growing, harvesting, and cooking seasonal vegetables and fruit.</p>
<p>"We have to learn about farming when we're little, not when we're graduates," she said.</p>
<p>"It's in our DNA to love nature, and it doesn't take long for children to feel connected to the natural world and the cycle of planting, growing, and eating healthful and delicious food," said Waters, who has vivid memories of eating tomato salad and strawberry compote that came straight from her parents' garden. It was a taste that drew her into the world of food and that, even now, reconnects her to the spirit of childhood.</p>
<p>"If children grow something and cook it themselves, they will want to eat it," she said. "It's like falling in love."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6c2be1448072701704d605cb0a116b8f"><name>rev-fall-15-life-realized</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Life, realized </title><summary>Alumni authors give voice to transformative experiences at UC Santa Cruz that changed their lives and shaped their careers.</summary><start-date>1440572400000</start-date><display-name>Life, realized </display-name><path>/2015/08/rev-fall-15-life-realized</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/rev-fall-15-life-realized</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1440628859181</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1441998098591</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email>dwhite1@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/weschler-lawrence-portrait-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/weschler-lawrence-portrait-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>weschler-lawrence-portrait-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>weschler-lawrence-portrait-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17144</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Weschler Lawrence Portrait</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Alumni authors give voice to transformative experiences at UC Santa Cruz that changed their lives and shaped their careers</article-subhead><article-text><p>Looking back on our college careers, some of us remember certain pivotal moments that redirected us and shaped our futures, clarified an issue that puzzled us and troubled our sleep, or challenged us to examine our assumptions.</p>

<h3>Lawrence Weschler</h3>
<p>nonfiction author, former <em>New Yorker</em> staff member</p>
<p>Asked to recall a hinge moment, Lawrence (Ren) Weschler (Cowell '74, philosophy, Western civilization), a much-praised author of narrative nonfiction and former <em>New Yorker</em> staff member, offered up two classics.</p>
<p>"My first week at Cowell College, in a seminar for the Western Civ core course with 12 of us students being led by Harry Berger, I was mouthing off about how stupid Plato's <em>Republic</em> was. 'No&#160;wonder Socrates wins all these arguments,' I declared. 'The people he is arguing with are a bunch of doofuses!' Harry looked over at me and said, 'The thing of it is, Ren, that Plato is a genius and you are a freshman, and he is playing you like a piano. Maybe you should try to make out to the music. Does it occur to you that as far as Plato was concerned, the tragedy of Socrates's life was that he never found someone to talk to&#8212;a worthy interlocutor&#8212;in his lifetime? And that the dialogues were sent out into the future in search of someone for him to have a conversation&#160;with.'</p>
<p>That was a pretty good lesson to hear one's first week in college&#8212;for starters that you should not assume that you necessarily know more than these masters, but more to the point, that you should always read actively, both read and monitor how you are reading and how you are being read. Which proved a good life lesson, whether engaging texts, or, later on, any sort of reportorial situation."</p>
<p>Along the same lines, Weschler relates how once, when studying with Marine Biology Professor Todd Newberry, he presented himself during office hours, floundering over some over-broad essay assignment.</p>
<p>"Newberry advised, 'Were you to be walking on a beach and come upon a dead walrus and wonder why it had died, you could do one of two things. You could pick up a piece of driftwood and start bashing its flanks, and all you would do is make a complete hash of things. Or you could take that same stick, go over to a boulder, pick up a stone and spend several hours sharpening the stick, at the end of which you would have a blade&#8212;thanks to which within minutes all would become clear.'</p>
<p>He paused and continued: 'When you are dealing with huge, amorphous issues, don't ask huge, amorphous questions. Spend 95 percent of your time honing the questions, after which the topic will open itself up to you.' Another lesson I regularly take to heart to this day."</p>

<h3>Hector Tobar</h3>
<p>Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning journalist and author</p>
<p>For Hector Tobar (Oakes '85, Latin American studies/sociology), now a Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning journalist and author, there were many decisive moments&#8212;and they started happening from the minute he set foot on campus as a 17-year-old in 1980.</p>
<p>"I'd grown up in a very flat, very dry series of Los Angeles neighborhoods&#8212;from the inner-city to the suburbs," he said. "I was awed by the landscape of the campus, with its soaring redwoods and expansive vistas. More than that, UC Santa Cruz was a cauldron of causes, of idealism and activism. I was a pre-med major, but quickly switched to the study of Latin American history, and to the theories of injustice and social change. Writing became my passion, in part because I was often in small classrooms where my professors worked hard at critiquing and editing my papers.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz made me a thinker and a writer. I spent many long hours in my apartment at Oakes College, and those of my friends, discussing and debating ideas and how the world worked and how we might make it better. I wrote for the 'minority'-run quarterly paper <em>TWANAS</em> (as in <em>Third World and Native American Student Press Collective</em>)&#8212;and I wrote, for the first time in my life, very long essays and papers.</p>
<p>Back then, you might write a 40-page final paper for a class. I hacked these out on my typewriter, and then in the computer lab where something called 'word processing' was being introduced to us, on computers that were so big we weren't even in the same room with them. And then when we were done we'd drive or bike into town to celebrate, and then ride back, up to the meadows and the forests."</p>

<h3>Martha Mendoza</h3>
<p>Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning AP reporter and author</p>
<p>Martha Mendoza (Kresge '88, journalism and education), Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning Associated Press reporter and author, had an awakening with personal, political, and professional implications.</p>
<p>"My pivot moment came when I landed in Conn Hallinan's journalism class," she said. "He was lively and engaging, and as angry as I was about the wrongs of the world. For the first time I saw work I could do that had real meaning.</p>
<p>I had just spent a summer visiting Central America and was really perplexed by the role the U.S. was playing in several small Central American countries. Our military was getting involved in civil wars and domestic issues, going well beyond humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>To see what war looked like, in person, as a 19-year-old was outrageous. The refugee camps, bombed homes, towns made uninhabitable because of land mines were fundamentally disturbing. I was aggravated that there was very little public awareness about this.</p>
<p>Conn told me 30 years ago I had 'enormous potential as a professional journalist.'</p>
<p>No one had ever said anything like that to me. I believed him, and still work to live up to his belief in me."</p>
<h2>90's</h2>

<h3>Reyna Grande</h3>
<p>award-winning author</p>
<p>Reyna Grande's hinge moment happened during one of those longstanding UC Santa Cruz traditions: a protest.</p>
<p>The future award-winning author (Kresge '99, creative writing, film and video) attended UC Santa Cruz on the advice of her junior college English teacher, who thought it would be good for her to get out of Los Angeles and see something new.</p>
<p>"At UC Santa Cruz, it was my first time being immersed in nature. The redwood forest offered peace and tranquility to my troubled spirit. I had left a home where I had been physically and emotionally abused by my father. In my dorm at Kresge College, I was free from the abuse. I finally felt liberated, and the beautiful surroundings helped me heal from my psychological traumas. It was there where I began to flourish.</p>
<p>When I chose to live at Kresge, I didn't know that most Latino students (there weren't many of us back then) were at Oakes College! Coming from L.A. where the Latino population is 50 percent, it was a shock to me to find myself as the minority. Often in my literature and creative writing classes at Kresge, I was the only Latina student. One day, as I was heading to class, one of my roommates&#8212;a Caucasian girl&#8212;asked me why I wasn't down at Hahn Hall with my people, protesting with them. I didn't know what she was talking about and I insisted that I needed to get to class. But she took me by the arm and dragged me to Hahn Hall because she said I needed to support my people in their protest.</p>
<p>When I arrived, I was in for a shock. There they were, the Latino students. Several hundred of them linking hands, chanting 'S&#237; Se Puede!' ['Yes, We Can!'] and 'El Pueblo Unido Jam&#225;s Ser&#225; Vencido' ['The People United Will Never Be Defeated']. They were protesting Proposition 209, which abolished California's affirmative action program, a program that had benefited me.</p>
<p>That day I suddenly didn't feel alone anymore at seeing all those Latino students. And as I joined hands with them I silently thanked my roommate for bringing me there. I found it incredible that a non-Latina had held me accountable and made me support my people! That first protest showed me that we all have a voice, and that together, we need to speak up for the injustices that we see in the world.</p>
<p>I felt different after that day. I had more confidence in myself. I was more determined than ever to get a college education and really make a difference in my family, my Latino community, and my country."</p>

<h3>Matt Skenazy</h3>
<p>assistant editor, <em>Outside</em> magazine</p>
<p>Matt Skenazy (Cowell '08, literature), assistant editor at <em>Outside</em> magazine, wasn't interested in writing before coming to UC Santa Cruz. But when he arrived on campus, he found out that Conn Hallinan, who so greatly influenced alumna Martha Mendoza, was about to teach his last class on campus. Also, Hallinan was a family friend (Skenazy's father is Paul Skenazy, a UC Santa Cruz professor emeritus of literature).</p>
<p>"For those reasons alone, I figured I should take it," Skenazy said. "The class changed everything."</p>
<p>By the time he left to travel in New Zealand and Indonesia after graduating, UC Santa Cruz had provided a focus and framework for those journeys. "On those trips, I didn't bring a camera. If I wanted to remember anything, I had to write it down."</p>
<p>Looking back, he is grateful for Hallinan and another alumna and faculty member, lecturer and student media adviser Susan Watrous (Kresge '87, American studies), for encouraging him to write.</p>
<p>"When I was away, I'd send them stories. Nine months later, I came back to join the soccer team for preseason in Brazil. I wrote a feature story for the school paper about the trip, which was the first piece I ever had published. I guess what I'm getting at is that though UC Santa Cruz no longer had a formal journalism program [the program ended in 2003], there were ways to develop as a nonfiction writer anyway; that is why we have such a long and wonderful list of alumni writers&#8212;Martha Mendoza, <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer Bill Finnegan, Lawrence Weschler, etc.</p>
<p>Later, I wrote a story for <em>City on a Hill</em> about noted author and magazine writer Dan Duane (Ph.D. '96, literature), also a UC Santa Cruz alum. He had a job I thought sounded great&#8212;traveling around and writing about adventures for <em>Outside, The Surfer's Journal,</em> and <em>National Geographic Adventure.</em> When I went to interview him, he was doing something in another room, but told me to look out the window and write down what I saw so I would have a scene to set the article in.</p>
Of course, I started the story with him telling me to look out the window. So those trips, my experiences at UC Santa Cruz, and Dan taught me to look out windows, so to speak."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, starting July 26. The Roosevelt Library is one of 13 Presidential Libraries, which house the records of Presidents Herbert Hoover through George W. Bush and preserve and provide access to historical materials, support research, and create interactive programs and exhibits.</em></p>
<p>As a successful TV producer, Paul Sparrow helped catch murderers and child abductors. He guided a 100-person production team across the wilds of Morocco to document one of the world's toughest adventure races. He directed more than a dozen documentaries and 300 hours of primetime TV, and won two Emmys.</p>
<p>But ask the 61-year-old Sparrow about the accomplishment of which he is most proud and he'll skip all talk about awards and primetime TV. Instead, he'll tell you about being part of the team that helped design the Newseum, a museum of news and journalism that draws 750,000 annual visitors to its site on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>"It's an extraordinary facility that tells an important story," said Sparrow (Porter '77, music), who serves as the Newseum's senior vice president for broadcasting and new media. "The First Amendment has never been more critical."</p>
<p>Television and the First Amendment were the furthest things from Sparrow's mind when he came to UC Santa Cruz in 1975. Instead, the East Coast transplant wanted to study electronic music, and the coastal campus was one of the few colleges that not only owned a Moog synthesizer but also taught it.</p>
<p>Inspired by luminaries like Music Professor Gordon Mumma and visits by avant-garde artists like John Cage and Roger Reynolds, Sparrow helped develop a music guild, which supported numerous concerts on campus. He earned a graduate degree at the Center for Contemporary Music at Mills College in Oakland but discovered after graduation that electronic music wasn't exactly a profitable line of work.</p>
<p>His trajectory changed when he was hired to work as a sound engineer for a documentary film about elephant seals at A&#241;o Nuevo State Park.</p>
<p>"(UC Santa Cruz Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology) Burney Le Boeuf was the first guy I worked with," Sparrow remembered. "In a way, I went full circle because that's how I got into film and TV."</p>
<p>Sparrow moved steadily through the television ranks after that first two-year project: from KPIX TV in San Francisco to co-executive producer for Fox's <em>America's Most Wanted</em> to executive producer of <em>How'd They Do That,</em> and, finally, senior producer of the Emmy-winning <em>Eco-Challenge: Morocco</em> on the Discovery Channel, the brainchild of reality-TV guru Mark Burnett.</p>
<p>"I found that making film and producing television has the same components of music," Sparrow said. "It's an ensemble sport. It's all about team. It has cadence and tempo. A lot of structural issues around storytelling are very similar to music."</p>
<p>But by 1999, Sparrow had become a new father, and the grueling schedule that included 60-hour workweeks and months-long stretches of travel was wearing thin.</p>
<p>He shifted gears again, and was hired as part of the team that designed and built the Newseum at its current location. There were exhibits to plan, scripts to write, documentaries to make. One of Sparrow's films&#8212;a look at the media's coverage of the Holocaust while it was occurring&#8212;won him an Emmy nomination and CINE Golden Eagle and New York Festivals awards.</p>
<p>"Our mission is to champion the five freedoms of the First Amendment," said Sparrow, who is considered an expert in new media. "We are the largest program to support the First Amendment in the world."</p>
<p>Now working on a new exhibit about the press and the Vietnam War, and updating an older FBI display, Sparrow said he is struck by the impact of the Newseum on its visitors. He sees people walking out of the 9/11 gallery with tears in their eyes and watches visitors standing enthralled by the photos in the exhibit dedicated to Pulitzer Prize winners.</p>
<p>"One of the things I learned at UC Santa Cruz was to follow your passion," Sparrow said. "Committing myself to something I'm passionate about is what has laid the foundation for everything I've accomplished."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6c3bca5b8072701704d605cbdacad775"><name>rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-garcia</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Profile / 1984: Barbara Garcia: Health mission</title><summary>When the opportunity came to help start Salud Para La Gente, a tiny health clinic for those same low-income residents in Watsonville, Barbara Garcia gave up her goal of being a teacher and jumped at the chance.

<p>"I would walk through the camps and see that the people who were feeding us were going hungry, and I associated that with a lack of food security and also a danger to health," said Garcia (Oakes '84, community studies).</p>
<p>So, five years later, when the opportunity came to help start Salud Para La Gente, a tiny health clinic for those same low-income residents in Watsonville, Garcia gave up her goal of being a teacher and jumped at the chance. Little did she know where that decision would lead.</p>
<p>Today, Garcia oversees 20 health clinics, two hospitals, and hundreds of programs in her role as head of San Francisco's mammoth Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>"It's a big job. It's a fun job," said Garcia, 59, who directs a department with a $2 billion budget and 8,000 employees. "Every day is incredible."</p>
<p>Garcia grew up in a blended family of 18 children. Her father worked in the Long Beach shipyards and her mom worked in the defense industry. It was there, in the beachside city known for its port and aircraft industry, that Garcia got her first taste of community organizing.</p>
<p>At 14, she found a job in a food pantry at a neighborhood center.</p>
<p>"It gave me a great perspective on how to work with people in need," said Garcia, who was the first in her family to graduate from college. "The one thing I learned was how to give respect to people who were seeking basic needs."</p>
<p>It's a lesson that has guided her life and her career.</p>
<p>In 1989, when a 6.9-magnitude earthquake roared through Watsonville, damaging its hospital, Garcia, then director of the Salud Para La Gente clinic, threw open the facility's doors. Residents flocked to her tiny center to receive medical care, food, and clothing&#8212;10,000 people in all.</p>
<p>When Garcia came to San Francisco as director of homeless services, she helped start an all-day triage-like event called Homeless Connect. There, volunteers and staff linked those living on the streets to services they needed&#8212;everything from finding an apartment to getting a new pair of glasses. The program has now been modeled in 56 cities.</p>
<p>Sitting in her office overlooking San Francisco City Hall, Garcia ran through a dizzying list of programs her department supervises: everything from restaurant inspections to running a health network that serves 120,000 patients as part of the Affordable Care Act, to providing mental health services, and managing more than 2,000 units of housing.</p>
<p>She has lofty goals, like reducing HIV deaths and transmissions in San Francisco to zero, and sustaining a health network that will keep the two hospitals under her care strong and financially healthy.</p>
<p>But for Garcia, it's always about the community she serves&#8212;whether it was during her years at UC Santa Cruz where she was exposed to the needs of farmworkers and low-income residents or on the streets of the city she now calls home.</p>
<p>"One thing I tell my executives is that they can't get lost in their own power dynamics. We have to keep to the mission we are here for, and that is to improve the health of San Franciscans," Garcia said. "We really have to focus on who we are here to serve."</p>

<p>Instead, the 1986 Merrill College graduate with degrees in sociology and psychology thinks how life will be different for children nationwide because of what she did.</p>
<p>Perry was the named plaintiff in a lawsuit that challenged, and eventually overturned, Proposition 8, a 2008 California constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages. The decision opened the door for same-sex unions in the state.</p>
<p>Her effort also was part of the groundswell that led to a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court in June, legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. Her case, <em>Hollingsworth vs. Perry,</em> provided a foundation for other district court cases and for the marriage-rights movement in general. In addition, the public education she engaged in was part of the change in public opinion that led to more acceptance of gay marriage nationwide.</p>
<p>"Sandy (Stier, Perry's wife and co-plaintiff) and I are elated and relieved that we now live in a country where everyone can be married," Perry said after the ruling. "We've both experienced not only the joy of marriage these past two years but also the sense of permanence and protection marriage provides.</p>
<p>&#160;"We are thrilled for our family and for all the families across the country who can celebrate their love and connection today."</p>
<p>Born in Bakersfield, Calif., Perry always felt like she was different. She just wasn't sure why until she came to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"The middle of my freshman year, I started to figure it out," Perry said. "I felt very supported as a person, and I found my voice, and how to be committed to a cause, and to put myself in situations where I made a difference. All the values that were emblematic of UC Santa Cruz were perfect for me at the time."</p>
<p>In 2004, she married her longtime partner, Stier, at a ceremony at San Francisco City Hall. "A couple of months later, we got a letter from the City of San Francisco saying they had to rescind the marriage," Perry remembered. "They'd attached the $35 check we'd paid for the marriage license. That really was a punch to the gut."</p>
<p>Four years later, Prop. 8 passed and Perry was asked if she and Stier would be plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging the same-sex marriage ban. Perry was working for celebrity activist Rob Reiner on early childhood education at the time.</p>
<p>It was not a hard decision, said Perry, although she knew it would put her family, including the couple's four children, under scrutiny. What was difficult, she said, was the pressure of having to represent an entire group of people with her story "in an authentic and useful way."</p>
<p>On June 26, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to overturn a lower-court decision that declared the amendment unconstitutional, and Perry got a call from President Barack Obama telling her he was proud of what she had done.</p>
<p>Two days later, after the lower court unexpectedly lifted its stay of the ruling, Perry and Stier were married in a rushed ceremony at San Francisco City Hall.</p>
<p>"I was elated, overwhelmed, excited, happy, and a little bit in shock," said Perry of her marriage. "I probably felt as happy as I have ever felt except for the day the boys (her twin sons) were born." (The couple's two other children are Stier's from a previous marriage.)</p>
<p>"Future generations won't be limited the way I was," said Perry from her Washington, D.C., office where she advocates for early childhood education. "I felt shame about who I was partially because of the laws (regarding same-sex marriage) that were in place. Those laws will be ancient history before kids today are old enough to fall in love."</p>
<p>Today, Perry is executive director of the First Five Years Fund, an advocacy group promoting early childhood education, and is happily settled with Stier in the nation's capital.</p>
<p>But it's not hard for Perry to summon the memory of the early days when she felt shame, when she was bombarded by the judgments of others because of who she was.</p>
<p>"I expended a huge amount of emotional energy just to feel OK or to be OK when other people were using their energy for totally different things like their careers and relationships," Perry said. "I spent my life in a defensive posture."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6c48692b8072701704d605cb058b1146"><name>rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-nelson</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Profile / 1991: Melissa Nelson: Revitalizing native cultures </title><summary>Melissa Nelson believes the best ways to teach Native American youth about their cultural past is through their hearts and minds, as well as their stomachs. </summary><keywords>Melissa Nelson</keywords><start-date>1440572400000</start-date><display-name>Alumni Profile / 1991: Melissa Nelson: Revitalizing native cultures </display-name><path>/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-nelson</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-nelson</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1440630728977</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1636132573951</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>native-american-heritage</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Amy Ettinger</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/nelson-melissa.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/nelson-melissa.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nelson-melissa.jpg</name><display-name>nelson-melissa.jpg</display-name><file-size>121508</file-size><width>253</width><height>380</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/nelson-melissa-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/nelson-melissa-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nelson-melissa-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>nelson-melissa-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23239</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Melissa Nelson is surrounded by artifacts in her office at San Francisco State University.

Now she is using traditional and ancient teachings, crops, and food practices as a way of increasing their pride and health, and diminishing their reliance on junk foods.</p>
<p>Nelson (College Eight '91, environmental studies), is a Native American activist and scholar traveling the world to educate, inspire, and learn from indigenous cultures. She teaches American Indian studies at San Francisco State University and is the president of the Cultural Conservancy, a Bay Area organization that is involved in indigenous rights and the food justice movement, re-connecting Native Americans with healthy "heritage foods."</p>
<p>"We are making sure that these foods and plants are accessible to people who need them," Nelson said.</p>
<p>She credits her time at UC Santa Cruz with blending her diverse interests in biology, ecology, and religious studies with her strong interest in social justice. "I found my kin at UC Santa Cruz," said Nelson.</p>
<p>After graduation, Nelson explored various nonprofit organizations in the Pacific Northwest, and in 1992 started volunteering for the Cultural Conservancy. She went on to earn a Ph.D. from UC Davis in ecology with an emphasis on Native American studies.</p>
<p>In 1993 she became the first Native American executive director at the Cultural Conservancy. Through education and activism, she works hard to inspire and train youth. "Most native youth are living in urban communities and are cut off from their traditional lands," said Nelson.</p>
<p>Nelson is working to revive interest in tribal food traditions&#8212;and many of her former students, including Trevor Ware, now an intern at the Cultural Conservancy, are taking her lessons to heart. He now grows Native American food and medicine at the College of Marin. His harvest includes heirloom tomatoes, corn, and soap plants, which are being distributed in urban areas in Oakland and San Francisco.</p>
<p>"For me, learning how to plant, tend, and harvest these plants is of the utmost importance," Ware said. "When I lived among my people in Oklahoma I saw that the vast majority of them ate whatever Wal-Mart had to offer, or a dollar store, or, even worse, the food at convenience stores in gas stations."</p>
<p>Ware is just one of many students who came to San Francisco State to study American Indian studies and went on to work with cultural revitalization.</p>
<p>"Melissa has influenced me in many ways. She has motivated me to be an active participant in revitalizing our cultures, and she really demonstrates how to do this through the numerous projects she is involved in," said Ware.</p>
<p>The Cultural Conservancy also teaches traditional native cooking, which blends stories and histories along with lessons in basket weaving, canoe making, and woodwork.</p>
<p>Nelson's work in academia is also part of her mission to revive interest in Native American history and culture. When she arrived at the San Francisco State University 13 years ago, she was the only full-time American Indian studies professor. She's helped to rebuild the department to include four other full-time native faculty.</p>
<p>Nelson is a regular contributor to academic journals. Her first edited anthology, <em>Original Instructions&#8212;Indigenous Teachings for a Sustainable Future</em> (2008), features three of her essays and focuses on the persistence of traditional ecological knowledge in contemporary native communities. She is currently editing a book on traditional ecological knowledge and sustainability, which will be published by Cambridge University Press.</p>
<p>In 2005, Nelson was the co-producer of the award-winning documentary film, <em>The Salt Song Trail: Bringing Creation Back Together,</em> and produces other media through the Cultural Conservancy.</p>
<p>Nelson has served on the boards of numerous environmental organizations including Earth Island Institute and Bioneers, and her activism and teaching have taken her to Bolivia, Paraguay, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
"I've really worked to integrate my academic and activist work in a reciprocal way," she said.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6c4bd07f8072701704d605cb71e3d965"><name>rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-hibbard</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Profile: 1995: Devin Hibbard: Beads and blessings</title><summary>When Devin Hibbard saw a woman named Millie sitting on her front stoop in the slums of Uganda rolling trash paper into tight little beads, she just had to know her story. </summary><keywords>Devin Hibbard, Bead for Life</keywords><start-date>1440572400000</start-date><display-name>Alumni Profile: 1995: Devin Hibbard: Beads and blessings</display-name><path>/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-hibbard</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-hibbard</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1440630952014</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1441842057328</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Amy Ettinger</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/hibbard-devin.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/hibbard-devin.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hibbard-devin.jpg</name><display-name>hibbard-devin.jpg</display-name><file-size>101501</file-size><width>253</width><height>380</height></image><image-alt>Devin Hibbard (photo by Charles Steinberg)</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/hibbard-devin-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/hibbard-devin-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hibbard-devin-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>hibbard-devin-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22853</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Devin Hibbard (photo by Charles Steinberg)</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Devin Hibbard (photo by Charles Steinberg)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Devin Hibbard was walking through the slums of Uganda when she saw a woman named Millie sitting on her front stoop rolling trash paper into tight little beads.</p>
<p>At the time, Hibbard (College Eight '95, community studies) had already been exposed to crushing poverty. She'd spent time in the field in India as part of her undergraduate thesis helping women in poverty. When she saw Millie's resourcefulness, she just had to learn her story.</p>
<p>Hibbard discovered that Millie had fled to the slums during the civil war. The only way to make any significant money in the city was to use dynamite to blow up rock in a quarry, then break up the pieces by hand, using hammers and other tools.</p>
<p>"She and all her children worked in the quarry," said Hibbard. Millie made the beads in hopes of making a little extra money for her family, as did other women in the slum.</p>
<p>Hibbard bought a few necklaces and began wearing them around town, where their inventive and flashy designs got noticed right away. Before she and her mother left Uganda they bought a necklace from each of the 100 women who lived in mud homes in the slum.</p>
<p>"We didn't have any experience selling products," Hibbard said. "We just wanted to create some economic activity."</p>
<p>After returning home to the U.S., Hibbard hosted an event at home to try and sell the beads. It was so popular that Hibbard decided to move back to Uganda to form Bead for Life, an international nonprofit organization that helps women lift themselves out of poverty by becoming self-sustaining entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>"My experience at UC Santa Cruz, and specifically with community studies, was formative in creating my desire to do work that matters and makes the world a better place," said Hibbard.</p>
<p>Women enrolled in the Bead for Life program commit to an 18-month training program where they learn bead-making as well as entrepreneurial skills and business savvy.</p>
<p>Bead for Life has grown exponentially during its 10-year existence so far. It got a big boost in November 2004, when O magazine ran a 250-word article about the organization, and helped transform it into a phenomenon.</p>
<p>"We sold $90,000 worth of beads in six weeks," Hibbard said. These days, Bead for Life sells about $2 million worth of jewelry and other items per year.</p>
<p>Hibbard marvels at the impact the organization has had on Millie's neighborhood.</p>
<p>"It has transformed the community," said Hibbard. Children who weren't being fed three times a day now have access to healthy meals, and 98 percent of the children of women enrolled in the program are in school.</p>
<p>The nonprofit has reached more than 40,000 people in Uganda. Women have started 2,290 micro-businesses as a result of the Bead for Life training, which offers more than just business know-how. It also encourages these women to have a greater sense of themselves and realize that a life outside of extreme poverty is within their grasp.</p>
<p>"We help poor women become self-sustaining entrepreneurs," said Hibbard. "Access to money is not the biggest barrier. Access to confidence is."</p>
<p>The group's success has inspired others to follow suit. Now 100 other nonprofit groups and for-profit businesses are selling beads made of recycled paper in Uganda and around the world.</p>
<p>"We really created a cottage industry," Hibbard said.</p>
<p>This fall, Bead for Life is launching a global initiative. "Our goal is to reach 1 million women around the world," said Hibbard.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Hibbard continues to travel worldwide so she can get a close-up view of the potentials and struggles of communities across the globe.</p>
<p>She met her husband, Mark Jordahl (Stevenson '93, Chinese religious studies), while they were enrolled at UC Santa Cruz. The pair is committed to spending time outside of the United States and exposing their two sons to the wider world.</p>
<p>"My 8-year-old lived about half of his life in Uganda and is constantly lobbying to move back," laughed Hibbard.</p>
<p>"If you don't get out," she continued, "you have no perspective of life in the U.S."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6c4e96758072701704d605cbfb40d8df"><name>rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-rivas</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Profile / 1995: Tlaloc Rivas: Opening doors through theater</title><summary>The 2007 story of Johanna Orozco haunted director/playwright Tlaloc Rivas for more than six years because her story coincided with his desire to upgrade the narrative of Latinos in the U.S.</summary><keywords>Tlaloc Rivas</keywords><start-date>1440572400000</start-date><display-name>Alumni Profile / 1995: Tlaloc Rivas: Opening doors through theater</display-name><path>/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-rivas</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-rivas</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1440631133792</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1441842323306</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/rivas-tlaloc.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/rivas-tlaloc.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rivas-tlaloc.jpg</name><display-name>rivas-tlaloc.jpg</display-name><file-size>102084</file-size><width>254</width><height>380</height></image><image-alt>Tlaloc Rivas</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/rivas-tlaloc-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/rivas-tlaloc-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rivas-tlaloc-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>rivas-tlaloc-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21677</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Tlaloc Rivas</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Tlaloc Rivas</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The 2007 story of Johanna Orozco haunted director/playwright Tlaloc Rivas for more than six years.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old Orozco, an orphan raised by her grandparents in a tough part of Cleveland, Ohio, had been shot in the face by an abusive ex-boyfriend. She survived months of surgery and grueling rehabilitation, then went on to inspire a change in Ohio law that gave more protections to teens in abusive relationships.</p>
<p>"Her story coincided with my desire to upgrade the narrative of Latinos in the U.S.," said Rivas, a professional director and playwright and an assistant professor of theater at the University of Iowa. "The current narrative in pop culture, the media, and Hollywood is that we are only represented by what we do in society. We are only recognized as people who pick the crops or clean houses or cook in the kitchens or do your landscaping. We are much more than that in this country."</p>
<p>In May, Rivas (Stevenson '95, theater arts) directed his original play based on Orozco's life, <em>Johanna: Facing Forward</em> for Cleveland Public Theater&#8212;a proud moment that has taken him from Watsonville High School to UC Santa Cruz and finally to his role as a prominent voice in the world of Latino/Latina theater.</p>
<p>"In my career, I have had one foot in the classical world, but also a foot in social activism and in theater that changes minds and hearts&#8212;one that creates a dialogue between art and the audience," Rivas said in a telephone interview from his part-time home in Iowa City, Iowa. He also lives in Pittsburgh where his wife, Megan Rivas, teaches at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
<p>Rivas's interest in social activism runs deep. His father, a school counselor, not only served as mayor of the farming town of Watsonville but he also founded a night school for migrant workers in Vista, California. His mother went back to school to become a nurse.</p>
<p>Rivas planned to study history and political science in college, but an acting class at Cabrillo College resulted in the discovery of his true passion. After an internship with El Teatro Campesino, Rivas and three other students went on to found Chicano Theatreworks, which continues to stage plays today.</p>
<p>Still, it wasn't until his senior year at UC Santa Cruz that Rivas was able to overcome doubts about his life's calling.</p>
<p>"I chose to direct a play, <em>The Shrunken Head of Pancho Villa</em> by Luis Valdez," Rivas recalled. Inspired by UC Santa Cruz Professor of Theater Arts Kathy Foley's work with Southeast Asia theater, he added an element of Bunraku, traditional Japanese puppet theater, to his production. He won numerous awards for his work.</p>
<p>"If I hadn't gotten that validation," he said, "I'm not sure I would have considered pursuing the craft."</p>
<p>Besides teaching, Rivas's theater work takes him around the country. His work has been seen in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and other venues. In September he was set to direct the original play <em>In Love and Warcraft</em> for the Halcyon Theatre Company in Chicago, and in 2016 he will direct <em>Prospect</em> by his friend Octavio Solis for the Boundless Theatre Company in New York.</p>
<p>But even as society becomes more diverse, Rivas said, the theater world, especially major companies, is only beginning to make room for Latinos and Latinas.</p>

<p>Little did Schaffer (Oakes '00, film) know, but those nights with his high school buddies&#8212;Andy Samberg and Jorma Taccone&#8212;were actually prep work for a career that would lead them to a stint on <em>Saturday Night Live,</em> a series of iconic music video parodies, movie credits, and even a role as cultural touchstones for the Internet era.</p>
<p>"We were putting ourselves through boot camp without any idea of what we were doing it for," Schaffer said of those years, which became the genesis for the now-famous Lonely Island comedy troupe he started with Samberg and Taccone. "We were training ourselves for the jobs we got."</p>
<p>Born in Berkeley of transplanted New York parents, Schaffer was a "shrimpy, short, white guy in a school that was not full of shrimpy, short, white guys," he said. He, Samberg, and Taccone bonded over their mutual shrimpy-ness and their love of movies like <em>The Jerk, Austin Powers,</em> and <em>Airplane</em>.</p>
<p>After he graduated from UC Santa Cruz&#8212;where Schaffer studied computer science for two years and also, he said, received a good grounding in filmmaking&#8212;the three friends moved to Los Angeles, resisted the lure of sitcom-writing jobs, and churned out overnight comedy videos.</p>
<p>"We didn't mind being broke and really wanted to take a shot at having our own voice the way Monty Python or the Zucker brothers or Woody Allen did," said Schaffer, as he drove to his Los Angeles office from his Hollywood Hills home.</p>
<p>The plan worked.</p>
<p>In 2005, Schaffer and Taccone were hired as writers for Saturday Night Live while Samberg (who studied at UC Santa Cruz 1996&#8211;98) got an acting spot on the show. That December, the trio created a rap parody video titled "Lazy Sunday," about a couple of lame guys planning to get some cupcakes and go to a Sunday afternoon matinee of <em>The Chronicles of Narnia.</em> The video was broadcast on <em>SNL</em>. It was also posted on what was then a little-known, video-sharing site called YouTube.</p>
<p>Five million views made "Lazy Sunday" the first viral video. The phenomenon was arguably a tipping point for YouTube, and also pushed traditional broadcast media into the digital age.</p>
<p>The Lonely Island went on to produce more parody videos, was nominated for three Grammys, and saw the men also branch out into their own careers. Samberg became a movie and TV star, Taccone went on to direct the movie <em>MacGruber,</em> and Schaffer directed feature films, including the 2012 <em>The Watch,</em> starring Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill, and Vince Vaughn.</p>
<p>He, Taccone, and Samberg are now working on a music-centric film acquired by Universal and produced by Judd Apatow. The three are writing the script and music, and Schaffer and Taccone will co-direct&#8212;just like old times.</p>
<p>"It's all good when we're apart (for different projects), but when we get back together and start working, that's our thing," Schaffer said. "It's always clear then that we're at our best and doing what we're supposed to be doing."</p>
<strong>Little known fact:</strong> The name Lonely Island came when Jorma Taccone brought the video <em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em> to the trio's low-rent apartment on a noisy Los Angeles street. Samberg and Schaffer made fun of Taccone for being so theatrical. He left, and the pair watched the movie, inspiring Schaffer to write a prank Tennessee Williams one-act play with lots of overwrought analogies, metaphors, and drinking. Schaffer called it The Lonely Island, referring to their apartment, which was located in a sea of speeding traffic. The name stuck for both the apartment and the group.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6c530df48072701704d605cb6666a8c0"><name>rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-townsend</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Profile / 2007: Cody Townsend: Steep thrills</title><summary>It's almost impossible to breathe for the full minute-and-a-half video that shows Cody Townsend hurtle himself on skis through a narrow crevice on an insanely steep, rugged Alaska mountain. </summary><keywords>Cody Townsend</keywords><start-date>1440572400000</start-date><display-name>Alumni Profile / 2007: Cody Townsend: Steep thrills</display-name><path>/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-townsend</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-townsend</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1440631426526</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1442005968434</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Amy Ettinger</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/townsend-cody.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/townsend-cody.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>townsend-cody.jpg</name><display-name>townsend-cody.jpg</display-name><file-size>159049</file-size><width>300</width><height>439</height></image><image-alt>Cody Townsend</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/townsend-cody-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/townsend-cody-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>townsend-cody-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>townsend-cody-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>51362</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Cody Townsend</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Cody Townsend</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/08/images/townsend-cody-mountain.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/08/images/townsend-cody-mountain.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>townsend-cody-mountain.jpg</name><display-name>townsend-cody-mountain.jpg</display-name><file-size>210159</file-size><width>300</width><height>460</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Cody Townsend takes big-mountain skiing to a new level on a vertical chute in the Alaska Tordrillo Mountain Range, earning himself the "Best Line" award at the 15th annual Powder Awards. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDEaAOcDKnA">View the clip.</a>&#160;(Photos copyright Blake Jorgensen/Swatch)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It's almost impossible to breathe for the full minute-and-a-half video that shows Cody Townsend hurtle himself on skis through a narrow crevice on an insanely steep, rugged Alaska mountain.</p>
<p>Townsend broke the Internet earlier this year with his 90-second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDEaAOcDKnA">YouTube clip,</a> entitled "Most insane ski line ever," from the ski movie <em>Days of My Youth</em>. To date, the clip has received more than 8.5 million hits.</p>
<p>The stunt earned the free-skier the "Best Line" prize for the best ski line at the 2014 Powder Awards.</p>
<p>At the end of the clip Townsend declares: "That was the scariest thing I've ever done." But the 31-year-old is planning for even more adrenaline-inducing adventures.</p>
<p>Townsend (College Ten '07, linguistics) has some advice for skiers who want to improve: "Go ski with people who are better than you. Surround yourself with people you can learn from."</p>
<p>Part of the thrill from watching that video is the sense that the terrifying ski run was spontaneous, as if he put on a pair of skis and jumped down the mountain. But Townsend's approach was methodical, not impulse.</p>
<p>"It was a five-year process of preparation," he said.</p>
<p>The Santa Cruz native grew up near the waves, but it was always the slopes that captured his heart and imagination. His parents own a cabin in Squaw Valley. Townsend's first memories involve skiing.</p>
<p>"I knew what I was going to do my whole life," he said. "I was obsessed with skiing from the time I was 6."</p>
<p>The immense popularity of the YouTube clip has given Townsend the freedom to pursue his own film project. That worldwide attention created its own momentum. "It was such a big thing&#8212;and people in the ski world want to see what's next," he said.</p>
<p>After receiving a boost in confidence as well as notoriety, Townsend hired a cinematographer to shoot his own movie called <em>Conquering the Useless</em> this spring in British Columbia.</p>
<p>Channeling the same boldness that motivated him to leap down that mountain, Townsend decided to veer away from the formula of many downhill skiing movies&#8212;which often rely on the sort of footage that some in the ski world refer to as "ski porn."</p>
<p>"Ski porn is basically the highest performance skiing in the world set to music," he said. "I wanted to step outside of that and show the human involvement, the pure fun that we have as well as new forms of adventure in the mountain. As skiers and athletes we have our own interpretation of the sport, and I want to bring the audience inside those stories."</p>
<p>Townsend is also using his savvy off the slopes. In 2010, he co-founded Arcade Belt Co., with the aim of making functional and lifestyle belts with an athlete's needs in mind. Based near Lake Tahoe, the product now has national distribution.</p>
<p>The company website includes a photo and self-effacing statement from Townsend, who referenced Santa Cruz locals who made fun of him "for being so obsessed with the oh-so-uncool sport of skiing. Who's laughing now? Well, they still are because they have big-paying jobs and skiers don't make [expletive] for money."</p>
<p>Townsend's plans for the future include more exploration and adventure, as well as pushing himself to keep improving.</p>
<p>"I want to keep trying to find more unexplored areas, where you have to step outside of established areas and use your own power and wit to go further than before," he said. "There are so many more unexplored mountains out there. Those are the ones that are enchanting to me."</p>

<p>She was a frustrated journalist working as a graphic designer and, in her own words, became obsessed with the show. So, the 2008 Stevenson College graduate with a degree in modern literature did what any self-respecting UC Santa Cruz student who'd lived through the 2005 bus strike would do: She hitchhiked to the world's biggest porn convention with a load of borrowed radio equipment, talked her way inside with a fake press pass, and began a podcast she called "Get Me On This American Life."</p>
<p>It worked.</p>
<p>Even though Foo claims her first pieces were awful, she sent them to UC Santa Cruz alumnus and Public Radio International host Jesse Thorn (Porter '03, American studies), who introduced Foo to Roman Mars of <em>99 Invisible</em> podcast fame. A short internship later, Foo was a producer for the NPR show <em>Snap Judgment,</em> which brought her to the attention of Ira Glass of <em>This American Life</em> and a full-time job.</p>
<p>"It was sort of meteoric," Foo admitted recently, as she sat in her tiny Manhattan This American Life office, its walls spotted with radio show posters and the kinds of letters from prison inmates that journalists tend to get.</p>
<p>Foo's job as a radio producer takes her into lives she never imagined: A Japanese comedian who became the subject of a cruel reality TV show, a lowly government official who was picked to assume the presidency if all the attendees at the State of the Union address were suddenly wiped out, and a 60-year-old man with a fetish for Asian women and a 30-year-old wife from China.</p>
<p>"One of the things I care about is showing the world there are other perspectives," said Foo, 27. "I try to educate people to open themselves up to others and to different ideas, to make this a less binary world."</p>
<p>To that end, she spends her days scouring the Internet, scrolling Facebook, and striking up conversations in a search for stories. "It's keeping your eyes open all the time," she said.</p>
<p>It helps that Foo, who was on her own by the age of 15, has a streak of natural curiosity and a tough work ethic. She's often at her office until late into the night. She also has a strong sense of social justice, which, she said, was nurtured during her years at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>While there are plenty of successes &#8212;<em>This American Life</em> has 3.6 million listeners&#8212;there's also a lot of failure inherent in the job, Foo said. Interviews fall through, stories come unraveled, pieces are rejected.</p>
<p>"I wasn't good at failure for a long time because it made me feel less-than," Foo said. "But since I've been here, I've come to embrace failure, and, every time it happens, I say, 'This is great. I just learned something today.'</p>
<p>"One of the things this job has done is given me the courage to fail."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6c56d8158072701704d605cb6f0d6fe3"><name>rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-loftin</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Profile / 2011: Tiffany Loftin: Changing the narrative around higher education</title><summary>Tiffany Dena Loftin met President Barack Obama, she was overwhelmed and nervous, but she managed to pull herself together.

<p>" &#8230; this could have been my son," Obama told the nation. "Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago."</p>
<p>When Loftin (Oakes '11, political science), a young African American activist, met the president in the Oval Office that day, she was overwhelmed and nervous, but she managed to pull herself together.</p>
<p>After all, she wanted to talk with him about a pressing civil rights issue that had been on her mind for many years&#8212;the right for everyone in this country, including under-represented groups&#8212;to have access to an excellent and affordable higher education.</p>
<p>She must have made quite an impression. In February, Loftin, 26, found out that she had been appointed to the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for African Americans, which focuses on improving student achievement.</p>
<p>The commission hopes to increase the number of African American students applying to, persisting in, and successfully completing college to ensure that the United States meets the president's 2020 goal of becoming the world leader in college graduates.</p>
<p>The news of her appointment came as a big surprise to Loftin since she didn't apply to the position. She found out she was in the running only after receiving word from the White House.</p>
<p>Loftin is the youngest person on the commission. Her work involves changing the conversation about higher education in this country.</p>
<p>"I believe education is not a privilege&#8212;it's a right," said Loftin. She's been fighting for this right ever since she started at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>During her time on campus Loftin served as Student Union Assembly president. She was also a part of the movement addressing recruitment and retention for students of color through programs like Destination Higher Education (DHE), and hate crimes and safety toward the black community on campus.</p>
<p>"Because of hate crimes at several UCs in 2010, it was a scary time to be a black woman on campus," she said.</p>
<p>Loftin also served as president of the United States Student Association (USSA) until 2013. The USSA was founded as the National Student Association in 1946 and is the largest student-run and student-led organization dedicated to advocating for college students in the United States.</p>
<p>Loftin grew up in Los Angeles, the daughter of a single mom. She is the only person in her immediate family to graduate from college. Her life story adds urgency to her mission and her message: "We need to change the narrative around higher education," she said. "It should not be about whether or not college is worth it. If I hadn't gone to college, I don't know where I'd be."</p>
<p>Part of her job is to confront barriers to education including costs.</p>
<p>Loftin, who is currently paying off her student loans, dreams of a time when no qualified student defers or cancels plans for college because of financial constraints.</p>
<p>Loftin's energy and enthusiasm seem tireless&#8212;she holds down a full-time job with the labor organization AFL-CIO and travels across the country for her activism work with campaigns like Freedom Side and #BlackLivesMatter. She's charismatic and talks fast and efficiently. She talks with pride about President Obama's suggestion that she run for office. In spite of that glowing endorsement, she's happiest as a grassroots organizer and activist.</p>
<p>Loftin maintains contact with many of the organizers she met through SOAR/Student Media/Cultural Arts and Diversity (SOMeCA).</p>
<p>"A lot of the networks I work with today," she said, "I built with the support and development I received at UC Santa Cruz."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6c5961b48072701704d605cb6cb00a9a"><name>rev-fall-15-philanthropy-focus-names-fame</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Philanthropy Focus: Names of Fame</title><summary>The names of UC Santa Cruz's unique colleges, buildings, and centers may seem natural and inevitable, as much a part of the campus's landscape as its famous towering redwood trees and rambling meadows.

But each name evokes a surprising story about visionaries, benefactors, legacies, and leaders who shaped the vision of the campus&#8212;sometimes in obvious and direct ways, and sometimes by sheer inspiration.</p>
<h3>Cowell family</h3>
<p>After driving over the Santa Cruz Mountains on a blistering summer day, the UC Regents, scouting out possible locations for a new Central Coast campus, felt the cool ocean breezes on their faces.</p>
<p>Up at the Cowell Ranch property, high in the foothills overlooking downtown Santa Cruz, it was just the right combination of sunshine and temperature. As legend has it, Almaden Valley in San Jose, another potential location for the campus, was so hot and muggy that the Regents groaned in discomfort and would speak no more about locating the campus there.</p>
<p>Soon the UC Santa Cruz campus began to take root at Cowell Ranch, adding a brand-new chapter for a piece of land that was already rich with history.</p>
<p>The Cowell family had relocated from San Francisco in the late part of the 19th century, after amassing a sizable fortune during the Gold Rush. Henry Cowell bought into a lime rock company near Santa Cruz and moved his family down to the Central Coast. Cowell had six children&#8212;Roland (who lived only one year), Ernest, Isabella, Sarah, Samuel Henry (known as S.H. or Harry), and Helen.</p>
<p>Cowell Ranch became a self-contained community with orchards, a dairy, lumber yard, hay building, and stables. The Cowells prospered there&#8212;and also faced tragedy. In 1903 Cowell's daughter Sarah was thrown from a horse and died, giving rise to a legend that her ghost still haunts a meadow on campus.</p>
<p>The heartbroken Henry Cowell died just a few months after his daughter. Ernest Cowell died in 1911, and then his sisters passed away. But S.H. lived long enough to impart a strong environmental legacy that helped bring about the creation of a fledgling campus; instead of selling off the old ranch property, he took pains to preserve it. A staunch environmentalist, he deeded Cowell Beach to the City of Santa Cruz, as well as the area that became Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. In 1955, S.H., the last Cowell, died and provided in his will for the creation of the S.H. Cowell Foundation. In 1961, the UC Regents purchased the ranch for $2 million, with the Cowell Foundation donating back $900,000 of the final price.</p>
<p>"Harry Cowell would be delighted to see all those smart, environmentally conscious young people at the university," said Ann Alpers, president of the Cowell Foundation. "I can't stress enough how grateful the foundation is to have the university be a good steward for the magnificent land that was the Cowells' home."</p>
<h3>Porter family</h3>
<p>The Porter family's roots in the Santa Cruz area go back even further than the Cowells'; in fact, their history in the region spans more than 160 years.</p>
<p>Benjamin Porter moved to California from the East Coast in 1851 and, with his cousin George Porter, acquired the Soquel Tannery on what is now Porter Gulch. After marrying Kate Hubbard, he went on to become one of the early directors of Santa Cruz County National Bank. The couple's only surviving child, Mary Sophia, an artist, married William T. Sesnon, a politician from Alameda.</p>
<p>In 1911, to honor Mary's parents, the Sesnons built the Porter-Sesnon House (then known as Pino Alto), a summer home on the original Porter property, currently home to Cabrillo College. Pino Alto became a place for artists and free thinkers to gather, along with patrons and dignitaries of the day. These summer soir&#233;es would often go on for days.</p>
<p>Molly Cliff Hilts is Mary's great-granddaughter&#8212;and a UC Santa Cruz alumna (she was Molly Porter Cliff in her student days).</p>
<p>"I feel a strong artistic kinship with my great-grandmother," said Cliff Hilts (Porter '81, art), mentioning their shared focus on community and celebrating artists. As a student, Cliff Hilts, a Portland artist, had her first exhibition at the Sesnon Gallery in 1981, when the college was named for her great-great-grandfather.</p>
<p>"Coincidentally, my senior show was exhibiting at the Sesnon Gallery during the Porter dedication, and I remember my grandfather walking through the gallery that day," she said. "It was the first time he had seen my body of work from college."</p>
<p>The Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery was established in 1968 with a gift from Mary's daughter, Barbara Sesnon Cartan, in memory of her mother.</p>
<p>Cliff Hilts is now developing an exhibition that honors her great-grandmother through a contemporary lens that could tie into the gallery's 50th anniversary in 2018.</p>
<p>The Porter and Sesnon families have a longstanding legacy that continues to this day on campus. If you were to look through their family tree you would find UC Santa Cruz alumni and recent donors to the campus, as well as a former UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee and president.&#160;</p>
<h3>Baskin family</h3>
<p>Members of the Baskin family have been important supporters of UC Santa Cruz since 1971. The Baskin School of Engineering and Baskin Engineering Building are named in honor of engineer, retired developer, and philanthropist Jack Baskin, whose gifts to the Baskin School of Engineering since 1971 total more than $10 million.</p>
<p>While engineering has always been Baskin's passion, he and his family have given widely and generously across the disciplines. The family has also contributed to the Elena Baskin Visual Arts Center, the Institute of Marine Sciences, Shakespeare Santa Cruz, feminist studies, an endowed chair in psychology, a scholarship in literature, and instruction in the arts.</p>
<p>Since 2007, the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation has contributed $765,000 for girls in engineering and science programs, and scholarships for women from local community colleges. The foundation plans to continue contributing to humanities and feminist studies.</p>
<p>"By supporting access to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) as well as feminist studies programs, we are highlighting the intersection between these fields and the need for a comprehensive approach to creating a foundation of human equality," said Nicole Baran, executive director of the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation.</p>
<h3>Long family</h3>
<p>Joseph Long, an entrepreneur and founder of Longs Drugs, had a strong friendship with UC Santa Cruz's founding chancellor Dean McHenry. Out of loyalty and friendship, the highly successful East Bay&#8211;based businessman contributed $1.9 million to the university's fledgling marine sciences program.</p>
<p>His most significant gifts were a discretionary fund for the chancellor and a capital gift to build a marine mammal research center at Long Marine Lab. Each of these contributions was more than $650,000.</p>
<p>Created in 1966, the Joseph &amp; Vera Long Foundation continues to support the university.</p>
<p>"We've had a good relationship with UC Santa Cruz," said Milton Long, grandson of Joseph and executive director of the Joseph &amp; Vera Long Foundation. "We've wanted to continue to support the marine lab. It fits in with the foundation's mission of conservation and education in Northern California."</p>
<p>The foundation has continued to invest in the development and growth of the Long Marine Lab. It helped fund the building of the Seymour Marine Discovery Center with a $250,000 capstone gift to the capital campaign, and gave $250,000 toward the Center for Ocean Health and $1 million to renovate the marine mammal research center.</p>
<p>Joseph's son, Bob Long, continued to give personal gifts for decades to assist the Friends of Long Marine Lab/Seymour Center.</p>
<p>Joe and Bob, through the Joseph &amp; Vera Long Foundation, also supported South and Southeast Asian studies, UC Santa Cruz's libraries, endowments for Pacific Rim studies and marine sciences, the Seymour Center's education programs, and the apprentice program at the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems.</p>
<h3>Hahn family</h3>
<p>One of the first names any incoming student at UC Santa Cruz ever hears is that of Alfred E. Hahn, whose name graces the student services center.</p>
<p>Hahn worked as a sales manager for a number of toy companies and was known for having a humble and reclusive nature. A native of New York, Hahn and his wife, Margaret, retired to Santa Cruz in 1955. Hahn&#8217;s interest in helping UC Santa Cruz students began in 1965, when he read an article by the founding chancellor, Dean McHenry, which described the financial need of UC Santa Cruz students.</p>
<p>The student services center building's original name&#8212;Central Services&#8212;was rather boring and prosaic, especially considering it was the very first building completed on the campus.</p>
<p>The structure now known as the Alfred Hahn Student Services Building was completed in 1965.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the original building was doomed. In April 1971, a frayed extension cord sparked the most devastating fire in UC Santa Cruz history, and Hahn Student Services suffered serious and extensive fire damage. But the administration wasted no time in repairing the building. Hahn Student Services now houses student services offices including general administration, registrar, financial aid, student housing, and disability resources.</p>
<p>Hahn bequeathed a $1 million trust fund to UC Santa Cruz in 1984, and the first Hahn Scholarships were awarded that year. Hahn committed his life&#8217;s estate of $1 million as an endowment to provide undergraduate scholarships to students at UC Santa Cruz who have financial need.</p>
<p>"Santa Cruz is a new university without a lot of established alumni, so I felt that anyone who could help should step forward&#8230;," the late Hahn explained. "I didn't do any of this for the publicity. If I can just help one student, that's what I want to do."</p>
<h2>What's in a (college) name?</h2>
<p>A quick rundown of how UC Santa Cruz's colleges got their names.</p>
<p><strong>Cowell College</strong> is named for Henry Cowell and the Cowell family, former owners of the Cowell Ranch property that is now the site of UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Stevenson College</strong> honors Adlai E. Stevenson, former governor of Illinois, Democratic presidential candidate, and ambassador to the United Nations. He was selected because of his life of public service and his dedication to the principles of democracy.</p>
<p><strong>Crown College</strong> is named after the Crown Zellerbach Paper Company, which gave the initial donation to fund the college.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Merrill College</strong> is named after Charles E. Merrill Jr., whose father, Charles E. Merrill Sr., was the founder of wealth management firm Merrill Lynch. In 1968, the Charles E. Merrill Trust donated funds for the construction of the college.</p>
<p><strong>Porter College</strong> is named for Benjamin Porter, grandfather of three University of California benefactors: Porter Sesnon, Barbara Sesnon Cartan, and William T. Sesnon.</p>
<p><strong>Kresge College</strong> was originally endowed by the Kresge Foundation. The Kresge family fortune was derived from the Kmart chain of discount department stores.</p>
<p><strong>Oakes College</strong> was named after philanthropists Roscoe and Margaret Oakes.</p>
<p><strong>Colleges Eight, Nine,</strong> and <strong>Ten</strong> are as yet unnamed and still seeking eponymous philanthropists.</p>

<p>In May 1974, Dale "Eddie" Kinnamon (College Eight '87, biology) was driving north on U.S. Route 395, then turned northwest on California State Route 89 heading toward Lake Tahoe. "Even though I was in a hurry to find a place to camp," he wrote, "I had to stop to try to capture this, the most spectacular sunset I have ever witnessed!"</p>

<p>From the AMA description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The common categorizations of video games, based on genres, don't do enough to help game players, game creators, or game scholars find games that might matter to them. Game genres lump together games with vastly different designs, subjects, and player experiences, while separating games with quite close relationships. In response, we have begun developing computational models of game relatedness and tools for exploring those models.</p>
<p>Our current models are based on latent semantic analysis of texts about games, as described in our&#160;<a href="https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/ryanEtAl_BottomUpGamesStudiesUsingNLP.pdf">recent FDG paper, "What We Talk About When We Talk About Games."</a>&#160;(pdf)</p>
<p>Our first set of texts about games is nearly 12,000 game descriptions from Wikipedia -- and we are working on incorporating a second set. We have three tools for finding related games that are currently available for the public to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First,&#160;<a href="http://gamecip-projects.soe.ucsc.edu/gamenet">GameNet</a>&#160;provides a network of games, each connected to those most related and unrelated in our model, with summary information and external links.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second,&#160;<a href="http://gamecip-projects.soe.ucsc.edu/gamesage">GameSage</a>&#160;allows you to start your search with an idea -- perhaps a game you're thinking of creating, or a game you've forgotten the name of -- and your description is "folded in" to GameNet's network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third,&#160;<a href="http://gamecip-projects.soe.ucsc.edu/gameglobs">GameGlobs</a>&#160;lets you divide the world of games up into an arbitrary number of groupings in two-dimensional space, then explore the content of each one. All three are part of the&#160;<a href="https://gamecip.soe.ucsc.edu/">GAMECIP project</a>&#160;between UC Santa Cruz and Stanford University, which is supported by the IMLS to improve how games are cataloged, cited, and discovered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The three of us got into doing work like this because we believe games are an important part of culture, and we want to do things to help them reach their full potential. This project is part of our work on making sure that the rich history (and present) of games can be preserved, discussed, and found in the future. We're also doing work on broadening what can be expressed through games, who can create them, and the conceptual tools we have for understanding them.</p>

four-week NEH Summer Seminar that will be held on campus in 2016.<br/>
 <br/>
 Designed for middle and high school teachers, the &#8220;Charles Dickens:&#160;<em>Hard Times</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>A Tale of Two Cities</em>&#8221; seminar will critically explore two of the famed author&#8217;s most frequently taught novels. <br/>
 <br/>
 These books are often discussed in the classroom because they are deeply engaged with political and social issues that are as relevant today as they were for Dickens in his own time--focusing on such topics as education, labor reform, law, social revolution, and terrorism. <br/>
 <br/>
 The seminar will take up these issues as it explores ways of framing for students many of the social questions and political dynamics of the modern world. <br/>
 <br/>
 The seminar will be directed by Marty Gould, professor of English at the University of South Florida. Emeritus professor of literature John Jordan--director of the Dickens Project at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;will serve as the principal investigator. <br/>
 <br/>
 Guests will include professors Sharon Weltman of Louisiana State University and Kate Flint of the University of Southern California, plus Jon Michael Varese, Director of Digital Initiatives for the Dickens Project.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;This grant gives evidence once again of the Dickens Project's position as the premier center in this country for the study and teaching of Dickens's novels,&#8221; said Jordan. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;In addition, it shows the Project's continued commitment to bringing Dickens's work before a wide audience, including younger readers, and to showing the relevance of Victorian literature to important contemporary issues and concerns.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Tapping on a range of disciplinary fields</strong> and methods, the seminar will consider how Dickens&#8212;and literature more generally&#8212;can promote cultural literacy while developing the ethical and political perspectives students need in order to fully engage with contemporary social issues. <br/>
 <br/>
 Though built around Dickens, the seminar&#8217;s methods are more broadly applicable, making the seminar useful for teaching literary texts in a wide range of humanities courses.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;The seminar director, Dr. Marty Gould, is a master teacher whose success in leading previous NEH summer seminars is widely known and admired among Dickens scholars,&#8221; Jordan noted.<br/>
 <br/>
 In their final projects, the participants will develop and share specific strategies for translating the seminar material into real-world classroom activities. The aim is to help students discover how humanistic fields of inquiry are necessary for understanding and responding to today&#8217;s most pressing social, political, and ethical challenges.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a269ed108072704638f4f2222ffe5322"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1325408400000</start-date><path>/2015/08/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/08/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1420064058610</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1420064058610</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
