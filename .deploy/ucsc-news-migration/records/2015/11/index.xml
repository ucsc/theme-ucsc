A team of American and Chinese researchers found the fungus in caves where bats hibernate and found bats infected with the fungus.</p>
<p>Although infected bats had lesions characteristic of the disease and similar to lesions seen in North American bats, the researchers do not know the extent to which Chinese bat species are affected by the disease.</p>
<p>"We don't have historic population counts for bats in China, but there is no obvious evidence of the kind of population collapses that we've seen in North America," said Joseph Hoyt, a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the study. Hoyt is first author of a paper on the new findings published November 2 in <em><a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/1/15-1314_article">Emerging Infectious Diseases</a>.</em></p>
<p>Scientists have known since 2010 that the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome is present in Europe. As in China, there is no evidence of the fungus causing mass mortality in European bat populations. Bat species in areas where the fungus has existed for a long time may have evolved resistance to or tolerance of the disease, but may still suffer appreciable mortality, according to coauthor Marm Kilpatrick, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The new study expands the distribution of the fungus enormously and raises many interesting questions, Kilpatrick said. The overlapping ranges of the affected bat species in Europe and Asia suggest that the fungus may be widely distributed across all of northern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>"There are several European species that come into northern Asia, and some Asian species that cross over into Europe," Hoyt said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Disease dynamics</strong></p>
<p>As a result of the new findings, Kilpatrick and Winifred Frick, who lead several research projects on white-nose syndrome at UC Santa Cruz, have received funding from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to study the dynamics of the disease in China. "We've been studying disease dynamics in North America, and this gives us an opportunity to replicate that work in an endemic region where the pathogen has been for a long time," Frick said.</p>
<p>The new findings have important implications for efforts to prevent further global spread of the disease, Hoyt noted. "People need to start thinking about decontamination after visiting caves in China," he said.</p>
<p>Hoyt conducted the first sampling for the fungus in China in the summer of 2014, after receiving a National Science Foundation fellowship intended to promote research collaborations between U.S. graduate students and Chinese research institutions. He teamed up with researchers at Northeast Normal University in Changchun, China. After detecting the fungus at nine out of 12 sites, the researchers returned in winter of 2015 for additional sampling of cave environments and hibernating bats. The winter testing yielded positive results for the fungus in 75 percent of samples from three bat species.</p>
<p>In addition to Hoyt, Kilpatrick, and Frick, the coauthors of the paper include Jiang Feng, Keping Sun, Guanjun Lu, and Tinglei Jiang of Northeast Normal University, China; Katy Parise and Jeffrey Foster of Northern Arizona University; and Kate Langwig of UC Santa Cruz. This research was supported by the National Science Foundation, National Speleological Society Rapid Response Fund, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Science and Technology Foundation, and the Switzer Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/bat-disease-grants.html</url><title>

<p>"I would walk through the camps and see that the people who were feeding us were going hungry, and I associated that with a lack of food security and also a danger to health," said Garcia (Oakes '84, community studies).</p>
<p>So, five years later, when the opportunity came to help start Salud Para La Gente, a tiny health clinic for those same low-income residents in Watsonville, Garcia gave up her goal of being a teacher and jumped at the chance. Little did she know where that decision would lead.</p>
<p>Today, Garcia oversees 20 health clinics, two hospitals, and hundreds of programs in her role as head of San Francisco's mammoth Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>"It's a big job. It's a fun job," said Garcia, 59, who directs a department with a $2 billion budget and 8,000 employees. "Every day is incredible."</p>
<p>Garcia grew up in a blended family of 18 children. Her father worked in the Long Beach shipyards and her mom worked in the defense industry. It was there, in the beachside city known for its port and aircraft industry, that Garcia got her first taste of community organizing.</p>
<p>At 14, she found a job in a food pantry at a neighborhood center.</p>
<p>"It gave me a great perspective on how to work with people in need," said Garcia, who was the first in her family to graduate from college. "The one thing I learned was how to give respect to people who were seeking basic needs."</p>
<p>It's a lesson that has guided her life and her career.</p>
<p>In 1989, when a 6.9-magnitude earthquake roared through Watsonville, damaging its hospital, Garcia, then director of the Salud Para La Gente clinic, threw open the facility's doors. Residents flocked to her tiny center to receive medical care, food, and clothing&#8212;10,000 people in all.</p>
<p>When Garcia came to San Francisco as director of homeless services, she helped start an all-day triage-like event called Homeless Connect. There, volunteers and staff linked those living on the streets to services they needed&#8212;everything from finding an apartment to getting a new pair of glasses. The program has now been modeled in 56 cities.</p>
<p>Sitting in her office overlooking San Francisco City Hall, Garcia ran through a dizzying list of programs her department supervises: everything from restaurant inspections to running a health network that serves 120,000 patients as part of the Affordable Care Act, to providing mental health services, and managing more than 2,000 units of housing.</p>
<p>She has lofty goals, like reducing HIV deaths and transmissions in San Francisco to zero, and sustaining a health network that will keep the two hospitals under her care strong and financially healthy.</p>
<p>But for Garcia, it's always about the community she serves&#8212;whether it was during her years at UC Santa Cruz where she was exposed to the needs of farmworkers and low-income residents or on the streets of the city she now calls home.</p>
<p>"One thing I tell my executives is that they can't get lost in their own power dynamics. We have to keep to the mission we are here for, and that is to improve the health of San Franciscans," Garcia said. "We really have to focus on who we are here to serve."</p>
<strong>Little known fact:</strong> During her free time, San Francisco Public Health Department Director Barbara Garcia trains and competes as a powerlifter.

Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Susan Strome, distinguished professor of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology, has received the 2014-15 Outstanding Faculty Award from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. The annual award is the division's highest honor for faculty achievement, recognizing combined excellence in research, teaching, and service.</p>
<p>Strome is a highly accomplished researcher who is also deeply committed to teaching and to developing more effective teaching strategies. She has received several awards for teaching excellence, including the 2013 UCSC Excellence in Teaching Award. Strome was awarded a UC Presidential Chair this year, which she will use to support her efforts to improve the teaching of large genetics courses at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Our department has been energized by Professor Strome's willingness to apply her considerable experience and prestige to the challenge of promoting effective learning in our large upper division core classes," wrote Alan Zahler, professor and chair of MCD biology, in a letter nominating Strome for the Outstanding Faculty Award.</p>
<p>Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, said the award is richly deserved recognition for Strome's exemplary record. "Professor Strome has done trailblazing research in developmental and molecular biology and offered exceptional service to the campus and the broader scientific community. Her students and the campus benefit from her creative and effective teaching, and from her strong leadership in developing innovative approaches to teaching," Koch said.</p>
<p>As a researcher, Strome is a leading authority on the development of germ cells, the cells that give rise to the sperm and eggs needed to create the next generation of organisms. Her research over the past 35 years has led to major advances in the understanding of how certain cells in the developing embryo become germ cells. She discovered "germ granules," distinctive structures that confer germ cell identity on the cells that carry them, and showed that germ granules are delivered to the embryo by the egg and then passed specifically to germ cells.</p>
<p>Strome's lab has also made important findings in the field of "epigenetics," which refers to&#160; heritable changes in gene activity that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence of genes. A growing body of evidence suggests that environmental stresses can cause epigenetic changes in gene expression that are transmitted from parents to their offspring. Epigenetic modifications affect gene expression by changing how DNA is packaged. Strome's research has shown how epigenetic modifications can be passed from cell to cell during development and across generations from parent to child.</p>
<p>Strome also has an impressive record of service at the departmental, campus, and national level. In addition to serving on numerous committees, boards, and grant study sections, she has been heavily involved in the MCD Biology Department's graduate program, including the recruitment of underrepresented students. Since she was recruited to UC Santa Cruz in 2007, Strome "has had a profound impact on our research community and our students," Zahler said. "She is a dedicated faculty member who represents the very best aspects of our programs."</p>
<p>Strome gave the 50th annual UCSC <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/strome-lecture.html">Faculty Research Lecture</a> this year. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, she earned a B.A. in chemistry at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, and a Ph.D. in biochemistry at the University of Washington, Seattle.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/09/epigenetics.html</url><title>Study shows how epigenetic memory is passed across generations</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d8eee81a8072701704be48b56b4b84d1"><name>campus-safety</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A message about campus safety</title><summary>The campus community serves as the eyes and ears for our police officers.

Two students, a university employee, and a construction worker suffered non-life threatening injuries. The suspect, described as a male student in his 20&#8217;s, was confronted by UC police where he was shot and killed by the officers.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>UC Santa Cruz officers, as well as officers from several UC campuses and local area agencies, have been sent to assist with the investigation. Crisis counselors from throughout the UC system have also been sent.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Acts of violence such as this are shocking and disheartening. We hope they never happen on our campus, but unfortunately, they can. The best we can do is be prepared, look out for one another, and immediately call 911 to report crimes in progress and suspicious activity.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Like UC Merced, we have an emergency notification system, <a href="http://emergency.ucsc.edu/cruzalert/">CruzAlert</a>, which is used to quickly communicate information during emergencies. I urge you to take the time to make sure their information is up to date. Communication is crucial during emergencies.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Additionally, the campus community serves as the eyes and ears for our police officers. It is imperative that we all do our part to share in the responsibility to maintain a safety community and care for one another. To help us maintain a safe community, please:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Immediately report all crimes, suspicious people, activity or information to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department.</li>
<li>Be alert to your surroundings. Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims. Attempt to keep a safe distance from strangers.</li>
<li>Trust your instincts. If something or someone makes you uneasy, tell someone, avoid the person or leave the area.</li>

I hope you'll join me in keeping the victims in your thoughts. If you need support, please remember that resources are available to all students through <a href="http://caps.ucsc.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> and to faculty and staff through the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/">Employee Assistance Program</a>.</p>
<p>I've just returned from an 11-day trip to China, where campus representatives and I met with U.S. Ambassador Max Baucus, as well as with academic leaders and students at Chinese colleges, universities, and high schools. Our primary goals were to build bridges to foster research partnerships and study-abroad opportunities for Chinese and UCSC students.</p>
<p>Students from China make up the largest percentage of international students at UCSC, and I want to build on that success&#8212;as well as increase the flow of students from Santa Cruz to China. UCSC has one of the highest percentages of UC students participating in the Education Abroad Program. That made quite an impression on Baucus, who studied overseas as a college student, an experience, he said, that changed his life.</p>
<p>Joining me was Joel Ferguson, professor of computer engineering, senior international officer, and associate vice provost of international education. Joel's responsibilities include supporting international students and initiatives, and his office will be working with Baucus's staffer Dorrit Lowsen, a UCSC alumna (BA, Environmental Studies, '99), to help streamline travel and visa arrangements for students and visiting scholars.</p>
<p>The value of in-person conversations was brought home after our meetings with Baucus and Lowsen, and many others. Email and phone calls, even teleconferencing, are fine to a point, but there's nothing like face-to-face meetings. They provide a forum to share ideas and concerns, brainstorm solutions to problems, and identify synergies and common interests that foster enduring alliances.</p>
<p>On the trip, we were able to get two commitments from the Chinese Scholarship Council and Ministry of Education. They agreed to support 40 additional students each year at UCSC to study and and conduct research. In addition, because of the Chinese partnership in the Thirty Meter Telescope Project, they agreed to form a 10+10 program between 10 Chinese universities and 10 in the U.S. (eight UC campuses, as well as Caltech and the University of Hawaii) to support 50 Chinese scholars per year working on astronomy issues at one of the U.S. campuses.</p>
<p>I'm grateful to Astronomy and Astrophysics Professor Doug Lin, who arranged many of our meetings, including with leaders of universities and high schools in Beijing, Nanjing, and Shanghai.</p>
<p>In many ways, Doug embodies today's international scholar: He was born in New York, grew up in Beijing, attended high school and college in Canada, and earned his PhD. at Cambridge University in England. After postdoctoral research positions at Cambridge and Harvard, he joined the UCSC faculty in 1979. He's equally at home on all shores of the Atlantic and Pacific, and, as the founding director of the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Peking University in Beijing, he is a veteran facilitator of international exchange programs for students, faculty, and postdocs.</p>
<p>This trip follows similar journeys I've made recently to Korea and India. Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway will be traveling to India later this month to further those conversations.</p>
<p>We are committed to raising UCSC's visibility as a destination for international scholars and to increasing opportunities for our students, faculty, and researchers who want to collaborate overseas.</p>
<p>Closer to home, I'm delighted that the campus has reached one of our top diversity goals: We've just received our first <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/hsi-award.html">federal grants</a> to support Latino student retention and success. We became eligible for these funds when the enrollment of Hispanic undergraduates topped 25 percent in 2012, so it's gratifying to receive resources that will help these&#8212;and all&#8212;students.</p>
<p>The campus's diversity and globalization goals are linked. I'm proud that UC Santa Cruz attracts students with a broad range of backgrounds, all of whom will benefit as the campus claims a greater presence on the international stage. First-generation college students, who make up about 40 percent of this year's frosh class, deserve the same array of life-changing opportunities as their peers whose parents earned four-year college degrees. Those opportunities include exposure to international students, who make up about 5 percent of our undergraduate population. The advantages of that exposure will pay off as our graduates live and work in today's global society.</p>
<p>We are building bridges to success, locally and globally. As always, I can be reached at chancellor@ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="da09ecc98072701704be48b59c2d9690"><name>rugby-team-uc-santa-cruz</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>How rugby arrived—unexpectedly—at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>Begun in the late 1960s, rugby teams remain a force on campus, and committed alumni have launched a new tradition of an annual rugby reunion&#13;

<p>In the fall of 1967, a few young UC Santa Cruz undergraduates including Carl Norris (Stevenson '68, economics) were hanging out on a sports field on campus when they noticed a couple of professors throwing, kicking, and knocking around an object that looked like a strapping, plus-sized, pale-white football.</p>
<p>The whole thing looked a little strange, but the professors were having a good deal of fun.</p>
<p>Intrigued, the students started chatting up physics professors David Dorfan and Ron Ruby, who explained why the method of play, and the ball in question, were so unfamiliar: The rugged pastime they were enjoying &#8211; rugby &#8211; was an import from Great Britain. Ruby, an American who had played on National Champion teams at U.C. Berkeley, and Dorfan, who grew up in rugby-mad South Africa, loved the sport, but had no idea they were helping to instigate a movement.</p>
<p>It didn't take long for those students to be hooked and start a fledgling team on campus.</p>
<p>Rugby is a highly physical game with loads of tackling, running and jumping. It is a &#8216;continuous action&#8217; sport that requires brute strength as well as a high degree of proper, sporting behavior.&#160;Following the match, all players must shake the hands of their foes on the playing field and give them a cheer to boot.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, &#8220;Football (soccer in the U.S.A.) is a gentlemen's game played by hooligans, while rugby is a hooligan's game played by gentlemen,&#8221; said Norris. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>Rugby reunion</strong></p>
<p>All these years later, rugby remains a force at UC Santa Cruz, with not one but two men's teams and an active women's program, battling Stanford, the University of Nevada at Reno, and state universities across Northern California.</p>
<p>Now, Norris and other committed alumni have launched a brand-new tradition: the UC Santa Cruz rugby reunion, which will be held every year.</p>
<p>The inaugural event, which consisted mostly of original team members from 1967-1968, was held in March 2014. An upcoming reunion has been scheduled for April 1 and 2, 2016, in the Santa Cruz area and will be open to all UCSC rugby aficionados. One of the highlights will be a match on Saturday, April 2 featuring Leland Stanford Junior University playing UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s team.</p>
<p>"For the first reunion, we had 50 people and raised nearly $8,000 for the rugby program, and I am hoping that we can triple the size of the event," Norris said.</p>
<p><strong>Staying connected</strong></p>
<p>While the group is now fundraising to ensure future reunions, the Internet helps keep their connections fresh.</p>
<p>After the most recent get-together, past players as well as coaches began to circulate mini-biographies of themselves to give their former teammates a sense of what they've been up to since their rugby days.</p>
<p>The result is a newsletter of sorts that is hilarious, rueful, and tragic at turns, with reports of aging and hip replacements, overseas vacations and remarriages, and entry titles such as "A Banana Slug's Slog Through Life." One rugby fanatic, Greg Ward, remarked that in his post-sporting years, "I discovered the true path for channeling aggression and competitiveness: being a trial lawyer."</p>
<p>Many of the life stories are quite complicated. Norris used to work in the aircraft industry, then became a teacher, returned to the aircraft industry, and retired. But the one consistent thread that will always connect them is rugby.</p>
<p><strong>Surprise appearance</strong></p>
<p>As Norris admits, rugby's sudden appearance on campus, during the second year of its existence, was highly unexpected. Only 1,000 students were on the campus at the time.</p>
<p>"These were the years of peace, love, and flower children," Norris said. "So the question of how athletics would fit into this brand-new campus was way, way down on everyone's priority list. Little or no thought had been given to an intercollegiate athletics progm."</p>
<p>In other words, the fledgling players had "an extremely small base" from which to develop any kind of sports program.</p>
<p>But those paltry numbers could not stop them. Right away, they formed a proper rugby team&#8212;and don't you dare call them intramural.</p>
<p>They took their games on the road and played many hard-fought matches. Some they won. Some were massacres.</p>
<p>&#160;Jock Reynolds (Stevenson '69, psychology), in an email thread to various UC Santa Cruz rugby-loving alumni, recalled his team getting "roughed up" on a less-than-regulation-sized rugby field "and scored on often" at UC Berkeley.&#160;</p>
<p>Another player, Bob Bell, from the Class of '69, had a more vivid&#8212;and not necessarily pleasant&#8212;memory of playing at Berkeley, though it seems a lot funnier now. The moment the &#8220;proud UC Santa Cruz team&#8221; ran onto the field in the Cal stadium, they were greeted by "monster-big football players in their off-season, one of whom said, 'Santa Cruz sent a (expletive) track team.'"</p>
<p>The game, not surprisingly, was quite an ordeal&#8212;but it made for some extraordinary memories.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="deb378c78072701704be48b5045efbcb"><name>theater-tandy-nutz</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Theater Arts collaborates with Tandy Beal &amp;

<br/>
 Directed and choreographed by California&#8217;s circus and dance maestro <a href="http://www.tandybeal.com"><strong><em>Tandy Beal</em></strong></a>, it&#8217;s a full-length variety spectacle that playfully reimagines the traditional <em>Nutcracker</em> for a family-friendly holiday extravaganza.<br/>
<br/>
 The production features original songs, seasonal favorites, and a re-scoring of Tchaikovsky&#8217;s well-loved music, all wrapped up in Beal&#8217;s multi-colored vision of circus, dance, and comedy. It&#8217;s literally a two-hour celebration of the arts.<br/>
<br/>
 The troupe of world-class performing artists includes circus acts such as Chinese footbalancer <strong>Wang Hong</strong>, who continues to charm Santa Cruz and international audiences with her grace and skill; contortionist/handbalancer <strong>Fleeky Flanco</strong>, whose stunning combination of acrobatic skills will amaze and delight; circus wheel artists, such as UC Santa Cruz Theater Arts alumnus <strong>David Poznanter</strong>; and rhythmic gymnast <strong>Saki</strong>, performing her popular Rag Doll routine.<br/>
<br/>
 The cast also features hip-hoppers, local gymnasts, and dancers from the UC Santa Cruz Theater Arts Department.<br/>
<br/>
 Several of the acts featured in <em>Nutz Re-Mixed</em> were recently enjoyed at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 50th anniversary Founders Day event held in September in the big tent on the East Field.<br/>
<br/>
 Notable alumni in the cast include Poznanter, a professional mask-maker, circus artist, singer, actor, and dancer.</p>
<p>After graduating from UC Santa Cruz with a B.A. in Theater Arts in 2001, he earned an M.F.A. in Interdisciplinary Arts from Goddard College, did three years of contemporary dance training at the Salzburg Experimental Academy of Dance (Austria), and studied at the professional training program at Helikos: International School of Theatre Creation (Italy).</p>
<p>In recent years, Poznanter has worked as managing director of Havik Circus in the Dominican Republic, performed acrobatics in an 80-city North American tour with Cirque Dreams, and spent two years in India as circus coach and personal trainer to Bollywood movie star Aamir Khan.</p>
<p>Another alum in the show, Natasha Kaluza, graduated with honors from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in theater arts and followed up with a graduate year of dance studies. She then completed the first and second year of the Clown Conservatory at the SF Circus Center under Jeff Raz.</p>
<p>Since 2003, Kaluza has been performing solo and ensemble works in theater, circus, music, and dance. Her credits include Circus Bella, New Pickle Circus, San Francisco Circus Center, Bread &amp; Roses, and the New York Clown Theater Festival.</p>

A psychologist discussing street art. A geographer talking about the business of farming. An environmental scientist documenting how predatory animals&#8217; fear of humans affects their behavior. These were among the unique talks at the UC Santa Cruz Division of Social Sciences&#8217; third annual Research Frontiers event Thursday, Nov. 5.</p>
<p>The Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History was filled with campus and community members as seven speakers from six social science disciplines gave mini lectures on how collaborative scholarship can address contemporary issues.</p>
<p>Alison Galloway, campus provost and executive vice chancellor, and Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of social sciences, offered opening remarks. &#8220;The social sciences is where innovation meets ambition,&#8221; Kamieniecki said, adding how scholars in the division push the edges of their fields to challenge dominant assumptions.</p>
<p>Natalia Lazzati, who joined the economics department earlier this year as an assistant professor, delivered the keynote. Lazzati said her research &#8220;asks questions that are not supposed to be addressed by an economist.&#8221; She has looked at problems of hotspot policing, crime in New York City, and currently, the impact of social interaction on smoking.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most striking aspect of economics is not the subject matter itself but the conceptual framework we use to approach the problem of study,&#8221; Lazzati said.&#8220; We can also benefit from other views.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Strawberry growers&#8217; predicament</strong></p>
<p>Also speaking was Julie Guthman, a trailblazer in the field of food studies, whose latest research looks at California&#8217;s lucrative strawberry industry and its challenges. Producers must deal with restrictions by lenders and insurers, drought-stressed plants and virulent pest problems, also difficult subleases with vegetable growers, Guthman said.</p>
<p>Coupled with a dependency on extremely toxic fumigants, a squeeze of high land values and low prices, and proprietary technologies, fixes are hard to come by. &#8220;The best solutions for the industry may not be best for California,&#8221; Guthman said.</p>
<p>Transitioning to organic is a growing trend but producers face additional problems. &#160;Among them, organic soil requires longer rotation. Brassica varieties such as broccoli work best to naturally kill harmful microbes, but farmers find that no one wants as much as they can grow. &#160;</p>
<p>Guthman&#8217;s light-hearted suggestion: &#8220;So if you like strawberries, eat more broccoli.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Assimilation and non-citizenship</strong></p>
<p>Catherine Ram&#237;rez, a professor in Latin American and Latino studies and director of the UCSC Chicano Latino Research Center, presented her latest research about assimilation and non-citizenship, the topic of a book she is writing.</p>
<p>She shared the story Jakadrien Turner, an African American 15-year-old runaway from Texas who, after being arrested, assumed the false alias of an undocumented Colombian woman to avoid charges and ended up being deported. Ram&#237;rez argued that the example of Turner, who could be mistaken for Latino, shows how assimilation can cross race and identities.</p>
<p>Thanks to a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon foundation, Ramirez will be exploring this topic further in a series of events throughout 2016. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>Russia, children, bugs, and pumas</strong></p>
<p>Melissa Caldwell, professor of anthropology and editor of <em>Gastronomica: The Journal of Critical Food Studies</em>, delivered a talk titled &#8220;Living Faithfully in an Unjust World: Practicing Kindness in Today's Russia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regina Day Langhout, associate professor in psychology and the provost of Oakes College, spoke on about &#8220;Children, Mural Making, and Participatory Action Research: How Children Made a Difference at their School.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>Stacy Philpott, the Ruth and Alfred Heller Chair in Agroecology, associate professor in environmental studies, and interim executive director of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, talked on &#8220;Urban Gardens: Sources of Beans, Bees, and Benefits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chris Wilmers, an associate professor in environmental studies, discussed &#8220;How Predators&#8217; Fear of Humans Shapes Their Behavior and our Ecosystems.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f2554ed28072701704be48b5a9a7c52c"><name>giving-tree</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Annual Giving Tree Program</title><summary>The Student Volunteer Center (SVC) is pleased to announce its annual Giving Tree Program, which is designed to help collect gifts for children in the Santa Cruz Community.</summary><start-date>1447142400000</start-date><display-name>Annual Giving Tree Program</display-name><path>/2015/11/giving-tree</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/11/giving-tree</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1447174688433</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1447174932077</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The <a href="http://volunteer.ucsc.edu/">Student Volunteer Center</a> (SVC) is pleased to announce its annual Giving Tree Program, which is designed to help collect gifts for children in the Santa Cruz Community. Our Giving Tree program works with the Jesus, Mary, and Joseph Home, Family Student Housing, and the Walnut Avenue Women's Center, to provide holiday gifts to children in the Santa Cruz area who are a part of these assistance and residential centers. &#8220;Giving Trees&#8221; are located at both on and off campus university facilities, containing ornaments with a child's name and their wish list. Generous participants pick the desired ornament(s), purchase the items, and bring them back to SVC so the gifts can then be wrapped and delivered. <br/>
 <br/>
 If you would like to participate, you can do so by selecting an ornament from a tree near you (locations include OPERS, Kerr Hall, Student Health Center, 2300 Delaware, just to name a few). You can also <a href="voluntee@ucsc.edu">email</a> SVC to request a list of giving tree locations, or to request that an ornament be sent to you via inter-campus mail.&#160; Campus community members are also welcome to&#160;drop into the SVC office located at&#160;Hahn Student Services #245, to pick up an ornament.&#160; All gifts are due back by November 25th; each ornament includes the drop off instructions.<br/>

Five years of volunteer experience at a rape crisis support center led her to realize she preferred hands-on work with students.&#160;</p>
<p class="normal">Since arriving at UC Santa Cruz as the campus&#8217;s first CARE advocate in February, she&#8217;s had a big role to fill. She&#8217;s a full-time confidential advocate and as CARE coordinator she&#8217;s getting the office up and running. Previously this work had been done by one staff member housed at Student Health Services through a program called SAFE (Sexual Assault Facts &amp; Education).&#160; The new <a href="http://care.ucsc.edu/">CARE office</a> will house three full-time confidential advocates who can support student, staff, and faculty survivors</p>
<h2 class="normal">Advocacy<strong><br/>
</strong></h2>
<p class="normal">Since the beginning of the year, the UC Office of the President has mandated that each UC campus establish an independent, confidential advocacy office for the reporting of sexual violence &#8211; defined as dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, and stalking. The requirement is one of the recommendations of UC President Janet Napolitano&#8217;s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Assault and Sexual Violence.</p>
<p class="normal">The name CARE is also required; each campus can decide what the letters represent. At UC Santa Cruz it&#8217;s Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education. The new office opened at Kresge College over the summer. A grand opening for students was held last month and another open house is set for for staff and faculty on December 16 from 4-6 p.m..</p>
<h2 class="normal">Office hours</h2>
<p class="normal">The CARE office is open Monday-Friday from 9 a.m.-5p.m. in Kresge 714, across from the Owl&#8217;s Nest caf&#233;. Appointments can be made by calling 831-459-2273 or email <a href="mailto:care@ucsc.edu">care@ucsc.edu</a> to reach CARE advocates directly.</p>
<p class="normal">Crutcher is joined by Tara Misra, CARE prevention educator who is also an advocate, and by five student staffers. The office is independent and reports to Mary Knudtson, executive director of the Student Health Center.</p>
<p class="normal">CARE serves as the primary point of contact for all survivors who experience any form of sexual violence in the UC Santa Cruz community, whether or not they choose to make an official complaint to the campus or police. Other members of the university community who receive reports of sexual violence can also take proactive steps to refer survivors to CARE.</p>
<p class="normal">CARE provides workshops and educational events on violence prevention, bystander intervention, creating a culture of consent, healthy relationships, and how to support a survivor.&#160; Each incoming student was required to attend a 90-minute presentation on consent culture and preventing sexual violence before classes began this fall. &#8220;We balance response with prevention,&#8221; Crutcher said.</p>
<h2 class="normal">Confidential conversations</h2>
<p class="normal">She also emphasizes the confidential nature of CARE services. She and other advocates won&#8217;t report to the Title IX office or police. What they will do is explain the options, including filing a report if that is what someone wants to do.</p>
<p class="normal">The complainant leads the process, Crutcher said.&#160; &#8220;My goal is for them to make a fully informed decision. I think of it as describing what the puzzle pieces are; it&#8217;s up to them how they want to put them together.&#8221;</p>
<p class="normal">She makes directed referrals to campus and community resources based on what the person wants to do. The only instance when she is required to break confidentiality is when there is an allegation of child abuse or a threat of self harm or harm to others.</p>
<p class="normal">Bottom line, she is an advocate, helping a person navigate campus bureaucracy and processes.&#160; &#8220;We speak up for them literally as an advocate,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p class="normal">Recruitment is under way for another CARE advocate and for a Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) counselor who will be based at the CARE office. Crutcher said she&#8217;d also love to hire a male prevention educator.</p>
<p class="normal">Though she earned her masters and was well on her way to a Ph.D., Crutcher is happy to put her academic training to good use helping students and others. &#8220;I&#8217;m able to use my research in informed practice,&#8221; she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://care.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (CARE)</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f3f42bbc8072701704be48b5f77d215e"><name>ncaa-championships</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Women's volleyball, soccer teams to compete in NCAA championship</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz women's volleyball and soccer teams are headed to the NCAA Division III championships.</summary><keywords>ncaa, volleyball, soccer, women's teams</keywords><start-date>1447200000000</start-date><display-name>NCAA championship</display-name><path>/2015/11/ncaa-championships</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/11/ncaa-championships</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1447201876890</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1447887673427</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/11/images/womens-soccer-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/11/images/womens-soccer-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>womens-soccer-400px.jpg</name><display-name>womens-soccer-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>22594</file-size><width>400</width><height>271</height></image><image-alt>Women's soccer team</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/11/images/ncaa-thumb-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/11/images/ncaa-thumb-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ncaa-thumb-80px.jpg</name><display-name>ncaa-thumb-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>7601</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sammy the Slug</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The UCSC women's soccer team</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/11/images/womens-volleyball-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/11/images/womens-volleyball-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>womens-volleyball-400px.jpg</name><display-name>womens-volleyball-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>24869</file-size><width>400</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>The UCSC women's volleyball team</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz women's volleyball and soccer teams are headed to the NCAA Division III championships.</p>
<p>Both teams will compete Friday in the first round of the Western division tournaments.</p>
<p>The women's volleyball team will play Washington University of St. Louis at 3 p.m. Friday at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks.</p>
<p>The women's soccer team will go up against Hardin-Simmons University at Trinity University in San Antonio.</p>
<p>"The women on both these teams are incredible ambassadors for UC Santa Cruz," said Cliff Dochterman, director of athletics, sports and intramurals.</p>
<p>The volleyball team has rebounded from a stretch of losing seven of 10 matches and a coaching change to go on to win five matches in a row, and 15 of their last 16 sets, he said.</p>
<p>The team is really growing and promises to be a top 10 team next year, if not by the end of the tournament, Dochterman said.</p>
<p>The soccer team is riding a three-game winning streak, with a double overtime victory this past weekend in Atlanta.</p>
<p>"Their dramatic victory, in a driving thunderstorm, is indicative of the incredible character of our Slugs," Dochterman said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fc6690b78072701704be48b5f4baaf91"><name>martin-quigley</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Arboretum appoints Martin Quigley as director of gardens and grounds</title><summary>Quigley was previously a professor of botany and director of the Chester M.

Quigley, who joined the Arboretum staff November 2, was previously a professor of botany and director of the Chester M. Alter Arboretum at the University of Denver.&#160;</p>
<p>"Martin brings a perfect blend of expertise in horticulture, landscape architecture, and academia to this position, as well as a deep appreciation for our collections," said Jessica Fiske Bailey, executive director of the Arboretum. "We are excited to have him on board and welcome his energy, enthusiasm, and new ideas and perspectives."</p>
<p>Quigley got an early start in horticulture, working at a local nursery and landscape business from age 11 through high school. He earned a master's degree in landscape architecture and worked for a decade in landscape design and environmental consulting before returning to graduate school for a Ph.D. in plant community ecology. Prior to his position at the University of Denver, he was a professor of biology and director of campus landscape and natural resources at the University of Central Florida.</p>
<p>"The UC Santa Cruz Arboretum is nationally and internationally known, recognized by scientific and horticultural groups alike, because its collections are unique," Quigley said. "I'd like to raise the quality of the visitor experience to the level of other eminent display gardens, and I'd also like to increase research collaborations, both with UCSC faculty and with extramural and international researchers."</p>
<p>As director of gardens and grounds, Quigley's primary responsibility is to manage the plant collections and direct the operations of the gardens. He also oversees educational programming and the creative development of interpretive materials and exhibits in the Arboretum.</p>
<p>Quigley earned his B.A. in English and comparative literature at Cornell University, M.L.A. in landscape architecture at Utah State University, and Ph.D. in plant community ecology at Louisiana State University.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="024da8af8072701704be48b577d04d8b"><name>koch-aaas</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Earth scientist Paul Koch elected 2015 AAAS Fellow</title><summary>Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, was honored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</summary><keywords>Paul Koch, AAAS Fellow</keywords><start-date>1448294400000</start-date><display-name>Earth scientist Paul Koch elected 2015 AAAS Fellow</display-name><path>/2015/11/koch-aaas</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/11/koch-aaas</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1447442622609</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1448293440345</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/11/images/paul-koch-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/11/images/paul-koch-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>paul-koch-350.jpg</name><display-name>paul-koch-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>73221</file-size><width>350</width><height>402</height></image><image-alt>Paul Koch</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/11/images/paul-koch-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/11/images/paul-koch-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>paul-koch-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>paul-koch-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17414</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Paul Koch</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Paul Koch (photo by C.

Nelson will be a speaker at Indigethanx, Indigenous Perspectives on Indigenous Food Ways, presented by the American Indian Resource Center, November 19, 6-8 p.m., at Kresge Town Hall. The event is free; parking available for $3 in the Core West Parking Structure.&#160;</strong></em></p>
<p>Melissa Nelson believes the best ways to teach Native American youth about their cultural past is through their hearts and minds, as well as their stomachs. Now she is using traditional and ancient teachings, crops, and food practices as a way of increasing their pride and health, and diminishing their reliance on junk foods.</p>
<p>Nelson (College Eight '91, environmental studies), is a Native American activist and scholar traveling the world to educate, inspire, and learn from indigenous cultures. She teaches American Indian studies at San Francisco State University and is the president of the Cultural Conservancy, a Bay Area organization that is involved in indigenous rights and the food justice movement, re-connecting Native Americans with healthy "heritage foods."</p>
<p>"We are making sure that these foods and plants are accessible to people who need them," Nelson said.</p>
<p>She credits her time at UC Santa Cruz with blending her diverse interests in biology, ecology, and religious studies with her strong interest in social justice. "I found my kin at UC Santa Cruz," said Nelson.</p>
<p>After graduation, Nelson explored various nonprofit organizations in the Pacific Northwest, and in 1992 started volunteering for the Cultural Conservancy. She went on to earn a Ph.D. from UC Davis in ecology with an emphasis on Native American studies.</p>
<p>In 1993 she became the first Native American executive director at the Cultural Conservancy. Through education and activism, she works hard to inspire and train youth. "Most native youth are living in urban communities and are cut off from their traditional lands," said Nelson.</p>
<p>Nelson is working to revive interest in tribal food traditions&#8212;and many of her former students, including Trevor Ware, now an intern at the Cultural Conservancy, are taking her lessons to heart. He now grows Native American food and medicine at the College of Marin. His harvest includes heirloom tomatoes, corn, and soap plants, which are being distributed in urban areas in Oakland and San Francisco.</p>
<p>"For me, learning how to plant, tend, and harvest these plants is of the utmost importance," Ware said. "When I lived among my people in Oklahoma I saw that the vast majority of them ate whatever Wal-Mart had to offer, or a dollar store, or, even worse, the food at convenience stores in gas stations."</p>
<p>Ware is just one of many students who came to San Francisco State to study American Indian studies and went on to work with cultural revitalization.</p>
<p>"Melissa has influenced me in many ways. She has motivated me to be an active participant in revitalizing our cultures, and she really demonstrates how to do this through the numerous projects she is involved in," said Ware.</p>
<p>The Cultural Conservancy also teaches traditional native cooking, which blends stories and histories along with lessons in basket weaving, canoe making, and woodwork.</p>
<p>Nelson's work in academia is also part of her mission to revive interest in Native American history and culture. When she arrived at the San Francisco State University 13 years ago, she was the only full-time American Indian studies professor. She's helped to rebuild the department to include four other full-time native faculty.</p>
<p>Nelson is a regular contributor to academic journals. Her first edited anthology, <em>Original Instructions&#8212;Indigenous Teachings for a Sustainable Future</em> (2008), features three of her essays and focuses on the persistence of traditional ecological knowledge in contemporary native communities. She is currently editing a book on traditional ecological knowledge and sustainability, which will be published by Cambridge University Press.</p>
<p>In 2005, Nelson was the co-producer of the award-winning documentary film, <em>The Salt Song Trail: Bringing Creation Back Together,</em> and produces other media through the Cultural Conservancy.</p>
<p>Nelson has served on the boards of numerous environmental organizations including Earth Island Institute and Bioneers, and her activism and teaching have taken her to Bolivia, Paraguay, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
"I've really worked to integrate my academic and activist work in a reciprocal way," she said.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="037f0cae8072701704be48b536b9eb5a"><name>working-for-dignigy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Low-wage report presentation will include discussion on raising the minimum wage</title><summary>The final report from a study of low-wage workers in Santa Cruz County, produced by the UC Santa Cruz Center for Labor Studies, is set for release at a community event Thursday, Nov. 19 in downtown Santa Cruz.</summary><start-date>1447418700000</start-date><display-name>Working for dignity</display-name><path>/2015/11/working-for-dignigy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/11/working-for-dignigy</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1447462636679</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1447463091336</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/11/images/wfd-159-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/11/images/wfd-159-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wfd-159-450.jpg</name><display-name>wfd-159-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>148109</file-size><width>450</width><height>395</height></image><image-alt>Bakery worker </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/11/images/wfd--4-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/11/images/wfd--4-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wfd--4-80.jpg</name><display-name>wfd--4-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>22163</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Cook</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz students surveyed more than 1,300 low-wage workers in Santa Cruz County to get a sense of wages and working conditions.

<p>The presentation will begin at 7 p.m. at the Museum of Art and History and will include a panel discussion on a statewide campaign to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The event is free and the public is invited.&#160; Refreshments will be provided</p>
<p>The discussion will include local workers and small business owners, community organizations, and experts on the minimum wage. Also participating are community groups working on affordable housing, wage theft and legal services, paid family and sick leave, voter registration, and immigration reform.</p>
<p>The report, &#8220;Working for Dignity: Low-wage Worker Study of Santa Cruz County,&#8221; is the culmination of a year-long project by more than 100 UC Santa Cruz students who surveyed 1,300 workers in service, farming, construction, and other low-wage industries around the county. Students produced a multimedia website showcasing their work at <a href="http://workingfordignity.ucsc.edu/">http://workingfordignity.ucsc.edu/</a>.</p>
<p>Steve McKay, UC Santa Cruz associate professor of sociology and director of the Center for Labor Studies, who oversaw the study, calls it a &#8220;census of the invisible.&#8221; In May, the students presented their initial report that showed that low-wage workers in the county earn a median wage of about $10 an hour compared with a county median of $17.81, which itself is low compared with other parts of the state.</p>
<p>Low wages combined with a high cost of living &#8211; caused primarily by high rents &#8211; pushes 22 percent of county residents below the poverty line, according to the California Poverty Measure from the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality.</p>
<p>Low-wage jobs are also the fastest growing, the students found.</p>
<p>Also participating in the project are California Rural Legal Assistance, the Chicano Latino Research Center at UCSC, and the Day Worker Center of Santa Cruz County.

<div></div>
<div>These crimes of opportunity can happen anytime during the day or night, and can be completed in a minute or less. Unfortunately, these crimes are on the rise throughout Santa Cruz County.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The following incidents were reported to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department:&#160;</div>
<div>

</ul>
</div>
<div>Also, officers also responded on November 12 to two separate calls of suspicious people in the East Remote Parking Lot and the Merrill College Parking Lot, No. 119. Officers responded at 8:25 a.m. to a report of two white males looking into vehicles in the East Remote Parking Lot. They were described as being between 35 and 45 years old with close trimmed beards and short brown hair. Officers were unable to locate the two men.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The second call involved a white male in the Merrill College Parking Lot, No. 119. The man was described as being between 20 and 30 years old, wearing a black fedora, black coat and blue jeans carrying a black backpack, and may have had a slim jim tool. Officers were unable to locate the individual.</div>
<div></div>

<div></div>
<div><strong>Safety Tips&#160;</strong></div>
<div>No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for his or her victimization. Perpetrators are responsible for crimes and their effects.&#160;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Never leave valuables, including bags, purses, wallets, laptops, cell phones or anything that may appear valuable in plain view.&#160;</li>
<li>Hide chargers and accessories that indicate GPS, cell phones or other devices may be hidden in your vehicle.&#160;</li>
<li>Use a mechanical locking device such as a club that locks the steering wheel, column or brake.&#160;</li>
<li>If you feel you or others are in danger, immediately call 911. Immediately report all crimes, suspicious people, activity or information to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department.&#160;</li>
<li>Be alert to your surroundings. Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims. Attempt to keep a safe distance from strangers.&#160;</li>
<li>Trust your instincts. If something or someone makes you uneasy, tell someone, avoid the person or leave the area.&#160;</li>
<li>Encourage friends to travel in pairs or with trusted companions, especially at night or in remote areas.&#160;</li>
<li>Use the Night Safety Escort Program, Monday through Thursday evening from 8:30 p.m. to 12:15 a.m. by calling 831-459-2231. More information can be found <a href="http://police.ucsc.edu/services/night-escort-safety-service.html">online</a>.&#160;</li>

<p>&#8220;The conservation field needs greater diversity to become even more successful,&#8221; said Erika Zavaleta, UC Santa Cruz professor of environmental studies who conceived of the UCSC-based version of the conservation scholars program.</p>
<p>UCSC will use its long-established strengths in conservation, experiential learning, and educating first-generation college students and students of color as it recruits 20 exceptional students nationally each year over four years for intensive hands-on field experiences. &#160;The campus joins the University of Washington, Northern Arizona University, University of Florida, and the University of Michigan in administering the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ultimate aim of the Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program nationwide is to foster an increase in the number of undergraduate students from groups currently underrepresented in the conservation workforce who choose to pursue studies and a career in conservation,&#8221; said Andrew Bowman, director of the foundation&#8217;s Environment Program. &#8220;We are proud to provide funding to UC Santa Cruz for this program and are confident in its ability to encourage and empower a broad network of students with the potential to change the face of the conservation field.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Intensive summer sessions</strong></p>
<p>Conservation scholars will take part in two intensive eight-week summer programs. The first will begin on the UCSC campus and later extend to UC Natural Reserve sites. The second summer will include eight-week internships with nationally known environmental conservation organizations. Students will also join together for a multi-day mid-winter retreat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our program&#8217;s long-term goal is to seed the conservation field with hundreds of skilled, innovative people from diverse backgrounds,&#8221; Zavaleta said.&#160; &#8220;By changing the face of conservation, we can increase its effectiveness and appeal to new talent from a broad range of backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zavaleta said the grant helps achieve the goals of the Coastal Sustainability Initiative of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, which has raised approximately $215 million to date.</p>
<p>Land, water, and wildlife conservation face great challenges but also hold great opportunities, Zavaleta said. One challenge is the tendency for conservation initiatives to exclude or be foreign to large segments of the population.</p>
<p><strong>Recruiting is key</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Key to the program is to find where diverse, promising students in conservation are,&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;Conservation needs to harness the broadest possible appeal and constituency to succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>To find the best students, UCSC will partner with other organizations including Santa Cruz-based SACNAS: Advancing Chicano/Hispanics &amp; Native Americans in Science. Outreach will include direct contacts with 50 top colleges and universities, all four-year tribal colleges, and 25 minority serving institutions including schools in Guam, Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal is to revitalize conservation, take fresh ideas, remake the field to speak to all of us,&#8221; Zavaleta said.</p>
<p>The program will partner with NGOs and public and private conservation organizations for the summer internships. Scholars will be paid a stipend of $500 per week for the eight-week summer field course and the eight-week summer internship. Program staff will work with students to identify mentors at each student&#8217;s home institution to link to the program year-round.</p>
<p><strong>Building community</strong></p>
<p>Another objective is to build a sense of community and belonging among diverse conservation leaders through a &#8220;Scholars for Life&#8221; approach to retain and advance alumni by sustaining supportive mentor and peer relationships during their early careers.&#160; It will emphasize cultivating tools essential for career success, including leadership, innovation, entrepreneurship, and communication skills.</p>
<p>The program is quintessential UC Santa Cruz practice, based on immersion, inquiry- and experience-based learning, and multi-disciplinary. &#8220;We explore not just the science, but also the art and the heart of conservation,&#8221; Zavaleta said. Program leaders will include lecturers from the humanities to augment the inquiry-based-science focus of the field course.</p>
<p>A UC Santa Cruz graduate has been hired as the program&#8217;s first director. He is Justin Cummings, most recently a post-doctoral researcher at Florida International University. He earned his Ph.D. at UCSC in ecology and evolutionary biology in 2013 and completed undergraduate work at Eastern Illinois University with degrees in Spanish and biology.</p>
<p>Zavaleta and Cummings traveled to Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Ariz. earlier this month to begin planning the recruitment process.</p>
<p>Recalling her own experiences in discovering conservation as a life&#8217;s work, Zavaleta said the program is about revitalizing conservation and connecting people to their passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a freshman in college I loved the outdoors and the study of life, but had no idea you could connect those things for a career.&#8221; She recalled a summer field course in Alaska when &#8220;everything clicked for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to provide the opportunity for students to find their passion in conservation.&#8221;</p>

<p>College can be a challenging time for students, and during times of stress it is not always easy find the help you need.&#160; The UCSC Slug Support&#160;Program&#160;was&#160;created to&#160;promote early intervention with students of concern to prevent culminating&#160;problems from escalating into&#160;a crisis.&#160; The goal is to identify students of concern and develop an action plan focusing&#160;on retention through provision of&#160;support and resources.&#160; UCSC's Slug Support&#160;Program is two parts, comprised of both an individual&#160;Slug Support Coordinator&#160;and the&#160;Slug Support&#160;Team.</p>
<p>We are asking for donations for the program, (i.e. toiletries, towels, blankets, pillows, etc.) even if they are slightly soiled or damaged.&#160; In particular, after conducting a sample survey of our first event we realized that after food, the most asked for items were toiletries, (i.e. toothbrushes, toothpaste, deodorant, body wash, acne products, shampoo, conditioner, feminine hygiene, razors, and toilet paper among others. All donations are greatly appreciated and we can set up a time and location at your convenience to pick up or have them shipped out. Or you can drop them off at the front desk of the Dean of Students Office.&#160; If you decide to donate we can provide you with a tax write off as well.

<p>The initiative applies sustainable materials management practices to decrease wasted food and municipal and industrial wastes in the United States, leading to economic and environmental improvements.</p>
<p>The campus achieved impressive source reduction of wasted food through a variety of approaches involving both staff and students. Dining Services monitors and tracks wasted food in the kitchen, from buffets and serving lines and plate waste. Staff members use this information to adjust the amount and type of food they order and prepare.</p>
<p>Dining Services also trains kitchen staff to properly store and rotate ingredients, and to use the best preparation techniques to reduce wasted food. Additionally, they pre-plate appropriate serving sizes, educate students on daily offerings and give samples so diners take only what they will eat, and educate student and staff about wasted food and waste reduction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been told by students that what they have learned while dining with us carries over when they go home, and they have become &#8216;waste warriors&#8217; for their families and communities,&#8221; Dining Services Sustainability Mananger Clint Jeffries said.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is one of 29 recipients of the 2014 Food Recovery Challenge Award given for achieving the highest percentage of food waste prevention. The EPA presented UC Santa Cruz with the top national award for source reduction &#8211; reducing wasted food on the front-end through careful training, menu-planning, and ordering.<br/>
<br/>
 UC Santa Cruz achieved its goal of working towards zero waste in all campus food locations by engaging students on sustainable agriculture and food systems. The campus reduced 100 tons of food waste, donated 1,000 pounds of food, and diverted 650 tons of food from landfills by expanding composting efforts on campus, saving their university more than $19,000.</p>
<p>In 2014, nearly 800 governments, businesses and organizations participated in EPA&#8217;s Food Recovery Challenge, including grocers, educational institutions, sports and entertainment venues and restaurants. These entities diverted wasted food from entering landfills or incinerators through a variety of innovative actions, including creative re-use of trimmings by university dining staff; donating excess, wholesome food to food banks, shelters and soup kitchens; composting in urban settings; and using wasted food to produce electricity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Food Recovery Challenge participants diverted nearly 606,000 tons of wasted food from entering landfills or incinerators in 2014, nearly 88,600 tons of which were donated to people in need,&#8221; said Mathy Stanislaus, assistant administrator for EPA&#8217;s Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response. &#8220;These innovative efforts will help us achieve our ambitious national wasted food reduction goal &#8211; a 50 percent reduction by 2030. I encourage other organizations to follow their lead by joining the Food Recovery Challenge.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1c8479bb8072701704be48b5761973cd"><name>in-memoriam-matthew-margulis</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Matthew Margulis</title><summary>We write to you with sad news that Matthew Margulis, a member of the Kresge College community, died on Sunday, November 15th.</summary><start-date>1447833600000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: Matthew Margulis</display-name><path>/2015/11/in-memoriam-matthew-margulis</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/11/in-memoriam-matthew-margulis</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1447882422662</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1448398518606</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We write with sad news that Matthew Margulis, a member of the Kresge College community, died on Sunday, Nov. 15.</p>
<p>Matthew was a senior, and a double major in philosophy and linguistics. He was, by all accounts, an ambitious, well-rounded, and dedicated student, diving into upper division work in his first year, and keeping active as a violinist in the university orchestra. He was a likely candidate for honors <em>cum laude</em>, and made a positive impact on his classmates and teachers in several departments, and throughout our campus community. <span><span>He will be greatly missed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>"Matthew was an outstanding philosophy major, peer adviser, and leader of the Philosophical Slug Society," Philosophy Chair Daniel Guevara said. "He will be greatly missed."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Kresge College will host a candlelight vigil for Matthew, Tuesday, Dec. 1, from 4:30-5:30 p.m. at the Piazzetta (<a href="http://kresge.ucsc.edu/commonground/about/our-space.html">http://kresge.ucsc.edu/commonground/about/our-space.html</a>). In case of rain, it will convene in Kresge Seminar Room 159. This event is open to all members of the UC Santa Cruz community who wish to pay tribute.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Students had planned to gather at <span>Matthew's regularly scheduled writing workshop at 10 a.m., Nov. 19 at Cowell 222 where staff distributed his handout, "Thimk: Strategies for Writing an Undergraduate Philosophy Paper."</span></span></span></p>
<p>Paul Roth, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, said he had Matthew "as a student both in an individual reading course and (by my invitation) in my graduate seminar. In the reading course, he and I worked through a number of works by Ruth Millikan, and Matt&#8217;s knowledge of linguistics proved invaluable in this process. I deeply appreciated the seriousness and thoroughness that Matt brought to his work. Indeed, I had encouraged him to develop points he had made in papers that he wrote for me into an article. He planned to go to graduate school (I have &#160;recommendation forms for him on my desk.)</p>
<p>"It comes as no surprise when one hears from people of professors who influenced them. It seems less often that we professors acknowledge how students can touch us and how we learn from them. I would like to acknowledge that of Matthew Margulis."</p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>A posthumous degree will be awarded.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>A memorial service for Matthew was scheduled at San Diego&#8217;s Congregation Beth Israel, 9001 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, Ca. 92122, Sunday, November 22.</p>

This video is their Latin Silver Rumba Final Round.</span></p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Marine biology and theater major studies one and practices the other </article-subhead><article-text><p>Most people wouldn&#8217;t be able to find any connection between an elephant seal and the cha-cha.</p>
<p>But 20-year-old Xochitl Clare isn&#8217;t most people. For her, it&#8217;s easy to see a link between a 4,000-pound pinniped and a boisterous form of Cuban dance. Not only does the marine biology and theater major study one and practice the other, but she also sees a very real relationship between art and science.</p>
<p>&#8220;Science is an experiment with yourself, and art is the same way,&#8221; says the fourth-year Kresge College student. &#8220;You have an idea, an interpretation of the world, and you try to work it out. With science your medium is labs and test tubes, with art it&#8217;s paintbrushes and movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about committing and exploring and not being afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raised in Glendale by an artist mother, Clare&#8217;s childhood home was filled with books and music. But it was a picture book about life under the ocean that set her on a career path at the tender age of 7.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really transformed the way I thought about things,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Drawn to UC Santa Cruz by its marine biology program and its spirit of adventure, Clare says, she eventually found herself working in Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Dan Costa&#8217;s lab.</p>
<p>There, she ran something called a bomb calorimetry machine, which is used to determine how much energy is in the deep-sea fish elephant seals eat and also help understand what drives the big seals to seek that prey.</p>
<p>The work has implications for deep-ocean management, Clare says. &#8220;What really keeps me going is the big picture and how important it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>But if running a lab machine is work that requires a certain stillness, what Clare does for her theater major does not.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s not only won awards competing with UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s ballroom dance club (her specialties are the rumba, cha-cha, samba, and jive), but she&#8217;s also appeared in a number of campus stage productions, including Tandy Beal&#8217;s upcoming <em>Nutcracker</em>-inspired show, <em>Nutz Re-Mixed!</em></p>
<p>She&#8217;s also directed two plays for the campus&#8217;s Rainbow Theater, including Pearl Cleage&#8217;s <em>A Song for Coretta.</em> The play is a celebration of Coretta Scott King, widow of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., as seen through the eyes of five female mourners at her funeral, including an Iraq war veteran, a survivor of Hurricane Katrina, and a college student.</p>
<p>&#8220;By coming together to celebrate Coretta Scott King&#8217;s life, these women all find strength in themselves,&#8221; Clare says of the play. &#8220;I felt like throughout the process of the play we were going through the same thing. As the play became stronger, everyone became stronger.&#160; We were women from different backgrounds and we were coming together to do this (play).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Xochitl has wisdom and knowledge and great compassion for the work of directing,&#8221; says Theater Arts Lecturer Don Williams, who guides the multicultural Rainbow Theater program. &#8220;She is a very talented and gifted artist with great insight. She brings value to any script she&#8217;s had the opportunity to work with.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Clare, dancing, directing, and lab work are all a part of moving toward a career in research.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to have an artistic and creative mind to do good science,&#8221; she says.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="20dc79318072701704be48b5287b69e2"><name>presidential-chairs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus fills eight UC Presidential chairs in support of research mission</title><summary>The eight new chairs - in everything from screenwriting to open-source software - bring the campus total to 30.&#13;

<p>&#8220;Endowed chairs are critical for a campus,&#8221; Dean of Physical and Biological Sciences Paul Koch said. &#8220;They can spur faculty creativity by offering seed funds to test a new idea that is a little risky or a base of support for a talented graduate student.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each campus was allocated $4 million to use as an incentive to encourage donors to establish endowed faculty chairs. The funding is from the Presidential Endowment Fund, a source of private donations that the president may use at her discretion to support university activities.</p>
<p>Each President&#8217;s Match is $500,000. Campuses were required to raise at least $500,000 per chair in donor funds to qualify for the match.</p>
<p>&#8220;The matching funds provided a catalyst for conversations with prospective donors who were interested in supporting faculty and graduate students,&#8221; Associate Vice Chancellor for Philanthropy Jeff Shilling said.</p>
<p>The endowed chair program was announced in the midst of the campus&#8217;s first comprehensive fundraising effort, The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz. The campus has raised $215 million toward its $300 million goal.</p>
<p>Napolitano has said she will allocate another $10 million in matching funds in subject areas that she considers to be of high strategic importance to California and the world. In making those allocations, Napolitano said she would also consider campus need and the ability to attract a match.</p>
<p>Shilling said he looks forward to receiving more details about future matching funds as donors seem to be especially drawn to opportunities where their gifts will be leveraged.</p>
<p>Endowed chairs are vital to UC&#8217;s efforts to attract and retain top-flight faculty, Napolitano told the regents. Once established, endowed chairs provide a dedicated source of funds, in perpetuity, for the chair holder&#8217;s scholarly activities as well as support for faculty salaries and graduate fellowships.</p>
<p>That kind of guaranteed support gives UC a competitive edge for recruiting faculty who are the very best in their field. And it helps the university bridge funding gaps in state support, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given our ongoing budget challenges, it is imperative that we develop new models of philanthropy that recognize and honor the interests of our donors while helping UC address its long-term funding needs,&#8221; Napolitano told the board. &#8220;The Presidential Match for Endowed Chairs helps us achieve both of those goals.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2117f6238072701704be48b571a6c8d1"><name>youth-success-campaign</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Youth Success Campaign: November 1-30</title><summary>We are asking all UC Santa Cruz employees to use this season of giving to focus on Youth Success and support the following local organizations:</summary><start-date>1447833600000</start-date><display-name>Youth Success Campaign</display-name><path>/2015/11/youth-success-campaign</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/11/youth-success-campaign</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1447959197162</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1447959444538</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>As educators, we have a stake in helping the youth in our community succeed.

In recognition of UCSC's 50th birthday, we can't think of a better way to give back to our community then setting a new goal of $50,000!<br/>
<br/>
Youth Success is one of the programs of the United Way. We are donors to United Way because we know our gifts go so far and touch so many. More than 75,000 county residents last year received services from the United Way for anti-gang outreach, teaching sustainability to the community, supporting health services for adults and so much more. Every dollar donated to the United Way of Santa Cruz County stays local in our community to help our citizens, neighbors, and friends.<br/>
<br/>
No donation is too small to make a difference in our community.<br/>
<br/>
To support Youth Success, go to the UCSC United Way at <a href="#">http://www.unitedwaysc.org/ucsc</a><br/>
<br/>
Fill out the form and submit it. <br/>
<br/>
Please send your cash/check donations via campus mail <br/>
Attention: Fiona Weigant, UCSC United Way Campaign <br/>
Mail Stop: Education Department <br/>
<br/>
Donations can be made with check, cash, credit card, or monthly payroll deduction. If you plan to continue your current donation, your payroll deduction will automatically renew for the 2016 calendar year. We continue to accept donations through campus closure.<br/>
<br/>
This campaign is sponsored by University Relations and supported by the Staff Advisory Board and the Academic Senate. We hope you will join us in supporting United Way of Santa Cruz County and the many agencies in our community that help make a difference in the lives of your neighbors.<br/>

<br/>
 The award is presented every two years "to honor distinguished lifetime contributions to the scientific study of justice and for efforts to advance justice as a field of study."<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;This is a well-deserved recognition of her many career accomplishments and their impact,&#8221; said psychology department chair Campbell Leaper. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 Crosby has been invited to deliver a Lifetime Award Winner address at the society's meeting next July at the University of Kent in Canterbury, England. She served as the group&#8217;s president in 2002-2004.<br/>
<br/>
 ISJR was founded in 1997 after a decade of discussions and conferences by academics in a variety of fields on the theme of social justice in human relations. ISJR consists of a network of scientists who work on justice-related issues. It represents many countries and a wide range of disciplines, including social psychology, sociology, business, political science, law-criminology, and economics among other areas.<br/>
<br/>
 Its aim is to advance justice research and allow international and interdisciplinary cooperation in justice theory and research. The group meets every two years.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="225bac9a8072701704be48b5b16c0787"><name>cafe-brasil-gvc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Library signs lease with Cafe Brasil for Global Village Cafe</title><summary>The menu will be based on Cafe Brasil's "Amazon Juices" concept in Capitola, which includes juices, smoothies, acai bowls, hot sandwiches, salads, and rice bowls.</summary><keywords>global village cafe, cafe brasil, dining</keywords><start-date>1447974000000</start-date><display-name>New operator for cafe</display-name><path>/2015/11/cafe-brasil-gvc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/11/cafe-brasil-gvc</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1447980412031</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1448036878663</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Library has signed a five-year lease with Cafe Brasil to manage the Global Village Cafe.</p>

<p>At their best, challenging incidents can usher in long overdue changes that promote greater understanding and equality. At their worst, they can exacerbate tensions and contribute to what some experience as a hostile environment.</p>
<p>Globally, we're seeing how hatred can lead to unimaginable acts of violence.</p>
<p>Nationally, students affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement stood in solidarity with their peers at the University of Missouri who are protesting widespread racism on that campus and working toward meaningful change.</p>
<p>On our campus, which has a long and proud history of student engagement in critical issues of equity and social justice, I want to be sure we acknowledge differences of opinion and work to maintain civility in the midst of turmoil.</p>
<p>In student government, as is their right, the Student Union Assembly this week voted to reinstate a resolution urging the University of California to divest from Israel. The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement has generated passionate opinions on both sides.</p>
<p>I'm concerned this resolution will have a chilling effect on individuals within our campus community. However unintentional, its passage may create an environment in which some of our Jewish students feel alienated and less welcome on our campus.</p>
<p>We have a commitment at UC Santa Cruz to engaged, respectful dialogue. The free and open exchange of ideas is a pillar of our <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html">Principles of Community</a>.</p>
<p>I am convening my <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/cdac.html">Chancellor's Diversity Advisory Council</a> to discuss the climate for Jewish students on campus. The council has advocated for African American students, LGBT students, and the disabled members of our community, among others, and I want to be sure our campus community welcomes and supports Jewish students, faculty, and staff. I will share my thoughts about that conversation as it unfolds.</p>
<p>Universities are microcosms of our complex, diverse global society. With so many differences, the opportunities for division are endless. Instead, let us make the conscious choice to seek common ground, to forge understanding, and to cultivate compassion. By doing so, we will model the way for the world-a laudable and fitting goal for UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="266a4df38072701704be48b503050574"><name>holiday-party</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Holiday Open House and 50th Anniversary Celebration</title><summary>Chancellor George Blumenthal and his wife, Professor Kelly Weisberg, invite faculty, staff and friends to join together in a special holiday gathering on Tuesday, December 15, from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. at Porter College Dining Hall.</summary><start-date>1448006400000</start-date><display-name>Holiday Party</display-name><path>/2015/11/holiday-party</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/11/holiday-party</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1448048479691</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1448048479691</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Chancellor George Blumenthal and his wife, Professor Kelly Weisberg, invite faculty, staff and friends to join together in a special holiday gathering on Tuesday, December 15, from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. at Porter College Dining Hall.&#160; As our 50th anniversary year comes to a close, we will take this moment to reflect and thank everyone for their contributions, and invite you to join us as we look toward the next 50 years.<br/>

The appointment is effective January 9, 2016 through December 31, 2016.<br/>
 <br/>
 Professor Ladusaw succeeds David Yager, who, as <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/chancellor-arts-dean.html">previously announced</a>, has accepted a position as president and CEO of the University of the Arts. <br/>
 <br/>
 A professor of linguistics who joined the faculty in 1984, Bill has also held a number of leadership positions on campus. Most recently, he served nearly five years as dean of the Humanities Division, stepping down this past spring. He earlier served as vice provost and dean of undergraduate education from 2004-2010, chair of the Linguistics Department from 1997-99, and provost of Cowell College from 1997-2003. <br/>
 <br/>
 The campus is preparing to launch a national search for this leadership position. I appreciate Bill's willingness to serve on an interim basis and am confident he will do an excellent job leading the division through this transition. Please join me in welcoming him to this important new role.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="364b04a08072701704be48b563aadb86"><name>career-advice-network</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Building the UC Santa Cruz alumni community</title><summary>With 100,000 alumni around the world, UC Santa Cruz is the hub of a powerful network that can connect recent graduates with established alumni. </summary><start-date>1448265600000</start-date><display-name>Building the UC Santa Cruz alumni community</display-name><path>/2015/11/career-advice-network</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/11/career-advice-network</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1448314864741</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1448314864741</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">With 100,000 alumni around the world, UC Santa Cruz is the hub of a powerful network that can connect recent graduates with established alumni. Those connections can jumpstart careers, facilitate introductions, and spark lasting friendships.<br/>
</span></p>
 <span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">We want to energize the UC Santa Cruz community and remove any barriers between alumni, recent graduates, and current students. That's why we are happy to announce that all alumni now have free, unlimited access to the services and support of the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association. We've eliminated all membership dues in an effort to bring all 100,000 of our alumni into the fold.<br/>
</span></p>
 <span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Alumni have told us through surveys and anecdotal feedback that they want to connect with current students to help them navigate the transition from graduation to career. Our new online <a href="https://ucsc.evisors.com/">Career Advice Network</a> (CAN) connects alumni with students by profession to facilitate mentoring and conversation.<br/>
</span></p>
 <span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">We want current students to know that from the moment they are admitted to UC Santa Cruz, they are joining a unique, responsive community that will support them for the rest of their lives. We're working to make that community more inclusive and accessible than ever. Go, Slugs!</span></p>

<p>Published as part of the THE World University Rankings 2015&#8211;16, the <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/ranking-methodology-2016">analysis</a>, conducted by Elsevier, measured overall research influence based on the average number of citations per paper, using a database of more than 51 million citations to 11.3 million journal articles published over five years, from 2010 to 2014.</p>
<p>With a citation score of 99.9, UC Santa Cruz is tied for second place with Stanford University. St. George&#8217;s University of London ranked first. Other institutions with high citation scores were California Institute of Technology and Harvard University, both at 99.8.</p>
<p>In describing their methodology, THE editors have called the evaluation of research influence their &#8220;flagship&#8221; indicator. As explained on the web site for the World University Rankings, &#8220;the citations help to show us how much each university is contributing to the sum of human knowledge: they tell us whose research has stood out, has been picked up and built on by other scholars and, most importantly, has been shared around the global scholarly community to expand the boundaries of our understanding, irrespective of discipline.&#8221;</p>
<p>THE has also ranked UC Santa Cruz eighth overall among the top universities in the world under 50 years old. UCSC&#8217;s overall ranking in the THE World University Rankings for 2015&#8211;16 was 144th.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3aa396118072701704be48b59b0167dd"><name>open-enroll-last-day</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Deadline today at 5 p.m. for open enrollment health plan changes</title><summary>Today, Tuesday, Nov. 24, is the last day of Open Enrollment. </summary><start-date>1448387820000</start-date><display-name>Open enrollment</display-name><path>/2015/11/open-enroll-last-day</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/11/open-enroll-last-day</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1448387778035</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1448387838649</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Today, Tuesday, Nov. 24, is the last day of Open Enrollment.&#160;</p>

<p>The award honors her father, his passion for social justice, and his capacity to address power imbalances in the community. It will be presented in February at the 32nd annual Martin Luther King Jr. Convocation, hosted by UC Santa Cruz. A committee will accept nominations through January 22.</p>
<p>Past recipients, of all walks of life, reflect the vision that was so much a part of Hill's work until he died in 2007 at age 62. They are people who are committed to social and economic justice and to implementing innovative solutions in the community.</p>
<p>The selection committee is especially interested in young people who are committed to social and economic justice work, says Melanie Stern, Hill's widow who serves on the committee along with Kemp, campus representatives, former award recipients, and longtime friends of Hill.</p>
<p>"The committee is really looking at those people in our community that have an intention to increase job opportunities," Stern says. "Tony was very passionate about economic justices as well as social justice."</p>
<p>Hill, who lived in New York in the early days of integration after Brown v. Board of Education, questioned power dynamics and encouraged others to do the same.</p>
<p>"That's where we see the injustices - how people are using their power or abusing their power," Stern says. "Our last recipient, Jacob (Martinez, founding executive director of Digital NEST), is a great example of an entrepreneur that has created opportunities for young people, who might not have had those opportunities, to learn new skills for the 21st century."</p>
<p>Through the Digital NEST, Martinez provides technology, training, and support to Watsonville youth.</p>
<p>"It was a complete honor to be listed in the same sentence as Tony Hill," Martinez said. "He's had a tremendous impact on the community here and on the entire county."</p>
<p>Another past recipient Gina Castaneda, a county juvenile probation officer and founding head coach with Aztecas Soccer Program, remembers participating in several of Hill's social justice trainings.</p>
<p>"Just to see how passionate he was about the community and what he was doing really motivated me and helped me to continue on my path of creating change and opportunities," she said.</p>
<p>Hill was one of the people to help establish the convocation back in 1985. He served on the speaker selection committee that draws national leaders each year to the local stage.</p>
<p>After he died, friends and colleagues on the committee felt his absence keenly and introduced the idea of the Tony Hill Community Service Award at the next convocation to honor&#160;his legacy. In 2009, then-Watsonville City Councilman Luis Alejo, now a California assemblyman, became the first recipient. Alejo was a perfect representative of a unifying bridge for a county that has experienced geographic and economic divisions.</p>

Passionately committed to social justice, she identified strongly with the three great social movements of her time: socialism, civil rights and feminism. They shaped her as an organizer, intellectual, and teacher who refused hierarchies while embracing and delighting in differences. She crossed boundaries wherever she encountered them&#8212;between teachers and students, academics and activists, young and old, rich and poor, gay and straight, black and white. Her emphasis on commonalities was crucial to the success of the progressive communities she created and sustained throughout her life.<br/> <br/> Marge Frantz was born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1922, to Esther Josephine (n&#233;e Frank) and Joe Gelders. Her father was a physics professor who joined the Communist Party during the Depression in order to organize for labor rights and racial justice in the deep South. She followed him, she often said, as her &#8220;lodestar,&#8221; becoming a member of the Young Communist League at 13 when she also hitchhiked across the country with him to New York. There, she sold <em>The Daily Worker</em> on the subway and began her life-long commitment to political activism. She entered Radcliffe College at 15, leaving two years later when she lost her scholarship because of her radical politics, she believed. This loss, along with the near-fatal beating of her father by thugs that a Birmingham steel company hired, taught her the costs of activism and the courage that pursuing it would require. The knowledge only reinforced her dedication.<br/> <br/> In 1941, Marge married Laurent Frantz, a lawyer and Communist Party member. She worked as an organizer and editor in Washington D.C. and Nashville until 1950 when, hounded by the Klu Klux Klan, they moved to Berkeley, where they raised four children and participated in the Bay Area&#8217;s radical community. The move proved to be pivotal. In 1956, Marge left the Communist Party and two years later she began her vital--if occasionally vexed--relationship with the University of California. She worked as an editor at UC Berkeley&#8217;s Institute of Industrial Relations from 1958 until 1969, when she quit her secure job in response to the university&#8217;s violence against students protesting at People&#8217;s Park. In this period, Marge met Eleanor Engstrand, who became her life partner, and she began to attend classes in political theory with professors Sheldon Wolin and John H. (Jack) Schaar. She enrolled formally as an undergraduate at Berkeley in 1970, completing her BA with distinction in 1972, when she started to work for a Ph.D. in politics. When Schaar and Wolin accepted positions at UCSC in 1973, she followed them to the History of Consciousness Department and moved with Eleanor to Ben Lomond.<br/> <br/> She received her Ph.D. in 1984, having written her dissertation on the philosopher and educational reformer Alexander Meiklejohn. At UCSC, Marge found the two passions that animated and shaped the next stage of her life: teaching and feminism. In an oral history she observed that her discovery of teaching &#8220;was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me.&#8221; It enabled her to find her voice, she said, and her m&#233;tier. First as a teaching assistant in 1973 and then as a lecturer beginning in 1976, she taught a range of courses for the American Studies and Women&#8217;s Studies departments (courses in U.S. social movements, U.S. women&#8217;s history, McCarthyism and oral history). She believed that the best classroom was one in which everyone learned and everyone taught, and this was the environment that she strove to create. She helped generations of students understand the essential relation of history to economic justice and social change. In 1989, she won a &#8220;Teacher of the Year Award&#8221; from Re-Entry Services, and in 1997, she was given a Distinguished Teaching Award by the Alumni Association. Over more than 40 years of teaching, she won the gratitude, respect and love of generations of students whose minds she opened and whose lives she deepened and enriched.<br/> <br/> Marge came relatively late to feminism. She said it was Adrienne Rich&#8217;s book <em>On Lies, Secrets and Silence</em> (1979) that finally persuaded her of the intellectual seriousness of the feminist movement. Once she was committed, there was no turning back. Feminism became the lens through which she saw all movements for social justice. She wanted to make the woman&#8217;s movement broader and more socially critical. &#8220;Working for women&#8217;s rights is trying to get incremental gains within the deeply patriarchal system that we live in,&#8221; she said, &#8220;&#8230;while feminism is challenging the whole system.&#8221; For her,&#8220;feminism requires a profound transformation of all of world society and all of human relationships.&#8221;<br/> <br/> However global her vision, Marge always acted locally. In addition to serving for many years on the Women&#8217;s Studies Executive Committee and the Board of Directors of the Women&#8217;s Center, she was a member of numerous college and departmental committees. She was in high demand as a speaker for campus events and commencements as well as for the local public radio station KUSP, Cabrillo College, the ACLU, and Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). She presented papers at Vassar College, Stanford University, UCLA and Williams College and published book reviews and articles in <em>Santa Cruz Magazine</em>, the <em>San Jose Mercury News</em> and <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em>, as well as in <em>Mother Jones, Matrix</em> and <em>Tikkun</em>. She was featured in the 1998 documentary film, <em>Seeing Red</em>, and she wrote a chapter for <em>Red Diapers: Growing Up in the Communist Left</em> (1998.)<br/> <br/> Marge is survived by her partner Eleanor Engstrand, three children: Larry Frantz of Vancouver, B.C., Virginia Frantz of St. Louis, Mo., and Alex Frantz of San Leandro; a sister, Blanche Hartman of San Francisco, and eight grandchildren. She was predeceased by her husband, Laurent B. Frantz, and her oldest son, Joe Frantz. A memorial will be held on January 17 in the Music Recital Hall on the UCSC campus from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. There will be a reception following the program. Contributions in Marge&#8217;s memory are welcomed by Aptheker/Frantz Women&#8217;s Studies Endowment at UCSC, American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, and Alzheimer&#8217;s Association, Northern California and Northern Nevada Chapter.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Helene Moglen, Emeritus Dean of Humanities and Professor of Literature </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3c1b9e6a8072701704be48b58a005ed3"><name>moaveni-nyt</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna's 'New York Times' article details womens' recruitment, escape from ISIS </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz alumna Azadeh Moaveni (Oakes, politics, ’98) wrote the dramatic and detailed Sunday 'New York Times' article that describes how three young Syrian women become enlisted – two by arranged marriage – into ISIS and later escaped to Turkey.</summary><start-date>1448412300000</start-date><display-name>Azadeh Moaveni</display-name><path>/2015/11/moaveni-nyt</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/11/moaveni-nyt</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1448412421701</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1448415454500</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/review-spring-2011-moaveni-azadeh.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/review-spring-2011-moaveni-azadeh.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>review-spring-2011-moaveni-azadeh.jpg</name><display-name>review-spring-2011-moaveni-azadeh.jpg</display-name><file-size>17369</file-size><width>242</width><height>504</height></image><image-alt>Azadeh Moaveni</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/11/images/moaveni-azadeh-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/11/images/moaveni-azadeh-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moaveni-azadeh-80.jpg</name><display-name>moaveni-azadeh-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>3258</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Azadeh Moaveni </image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Azadeh Moaveni (Photo by Mehrdad Daftari)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz alumna Azadeh Moaveni (Oakes, politics, &#8217;98) wrote the dramatic and detailed Sunday <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/world/middleeast/isis-wives-and-enforcers-in-syria-recount-collaboration-anguish-and-escape.html"><em>New York Times</em> article</a> that describes how three young Syrian women become enlisted &#8211; two by arranged marriage &#8211; into ISIS and later escaped to Turkey.</p>
<p>Moaveni, who spoke at the Oakes College commencement last June, is a former Middle East correspondent for <em>Time</em> magazine and reported from throughout the region for much of the past decade for the newsweekly as well as the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, the <em>Washington Post,</em> and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.</p>
<p>Moaveni&#8217;s article, &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/world/middleeast/isis-wives-and-enforcers-in-syria-recount-collaboration-anguish-and-escape.html">ISIS Women and Enforcers in Syria Recount Collaboration, Anguish and Escape</a>,&#8221; reveals how the women became members of the Khansaa Brigade, the Islamic State's female morality police, and later fled. The husbands of the two women who married died as suicide bombers. The piece also exposes the rise of the Islamic State in Raqqa, Syria, its Iraqi origins and leaders, and the influence of foreigners who streamed into the city.</p>
<p>Moaveni was raised in San Jose with Iranian exile parents. After UCSC, she won a Fulbright Fellowship to Egypt and studied Arabic at the American University in Cairo.&#160; She later lived in Iran and married an Iranian with whom she has a son. She&#8217;s written two books, <em>Lipstick Jihad</em> and <em>Honeymoon in Tehran,</em> and co-wrote <em>Iran Awakening</em> with Nobel peace prize winner Shirin Ebadi.</p>
<p>She now lives in Cambridge and teaches journalism at Kingston University in London and has also contributed to the <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Foreign Policy</em>.</p>
<p>Four years ago writing in the <em>UCSC Review</em>, Moaveni described her growth as a writer from her writing and literature classes and how she learned about long-form journalism. She said it was under writing instructor and <em>City on the Hill Press</em> advisor Conn Hallinan &#8220;that I learned to love the genre that would become my life's work: literary journalism.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/world/middleeast/isis-wives-and-enforcers-in-syria-recount-collaboration-anguish-and-escape.html</url><title>'ISIS Women and Enforcers in Syria Recount Collaboration, Anguish and Escape'</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/04/review-spring-2011-uncommon-moaveni.html</url><title>Azadeh Moaveni's UCSC Review article</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://review.ucsc.edu/fall05/RevF05-Torn_between_cultures.pdf</url><title>Previous coverage</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/11/images/moaveni-azadeh-295.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/11/images/moaveni-azadeh-295.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moaveni-azadeh-295.jpg</name><display-name>moaveni-azadeh-295.jpg</display-name><file-size>22572</file-size><width>295</width><height>120</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Azadeh Moaveni</thumb-alt><title>Azadeh Moaveni</title><description>Writing in the 'New York Times,' alumna chronicles the 'collaboration, anguish, and escape' of Syrian women enlisted as enforcers in the Islamic State. </description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5a9d4ab68072701704be48b52a9b7ebf"><name>shortlisted-oscar-film</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Art professor to screen film shortlisted for Oscar nomination </title><summary>Last Day of Freedom, an award-winning animated short by UC Santa Cruz associate professor of art Dee Hibbert-Jones, will be screened on campus, December 3 at Kresge Town Hall.&#13;

 <br/>
 The film tells the story of one man&#8217;s decision to stand by his brother, a veteran returning from war, as he faces criminal charges, racism, and ultimately the death penalty. <br/>
 <br/>
 Following the screening, there will be a Q&amp;A with the filmmakers and Estrus Tucker, a Vietnam-era veteran, ordained minister, facilitator on issues of race and reconciliation, and board member of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty.<br/>
 <br/>
 <em>Last Day of Freedom</em> qualified for a possible Academy Award nomination earlier this year by winning the Jury Award for &#8220;Best Short&#8221; at the 18th annual Full Frame Documentary Film Festival.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;There were 74 qualifying films, but it was recently narrowed down to a list of 10,&#8221; noted Hibbert-Jones. &#8220;The next cut is on January 14, which is for the top 5 nominations for the awards,&#8221; she added. <br/>
 <br/>
 The 88th annual Academy Awards will be held on Sunday, February 28, 2016, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, and will be televised live in more than 225 countries and territories worldwide.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;We&#8217;re so touched by responses to the film and were frankly stunned,&#8221; said Hibbert-Jones. &#8220;When we were accepted to the Full Frame festival, we were so excited and we didn&#8217;t expect any more than that. Then we were given two awards there, and then a series of awards from other festivals since. It&#8217;s amazing.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;We&#8217;re still stunned,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I actually found out that we were semi-finalists for the Oscars on the runway taking off for a festival in Leipzig, which made that even more surreal!&#8221; she added. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;We&#8217;ve been working on this project for several years, and for a while I felt we&#8217;d never get to a finished piece. When we started to hear responses that described the project as we&#8217;d hoped it would be seen, it was incredibly heartening. There are 32,000 drawings. It&#8217;s been a lot of work to get here--lots of discussions about the metaphors, the imagery, the sound etc.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Hibbert-Jones said that she and Talisman are also developing a multi-platform documentary series&#8212;&#8220;an episode-based web doc&#8221;--told from the perspectives of families impacted by the death penalty and other forms of incarceration. <br/>
 <br/>
 The site will include animated stories from families affected by the death penalty, as well as commentary from community members and national specialists talking about the implications of incarceration and capital punishment on families, specifically in the areas of&#160; trauma, criminal justice, racial justice and safe communities. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Our idea is to bring a new understanding of our criminal justice system to the public--created through animations, pod casts, etc--to raise awareness and promote a call to action regarding our broken criminal justice system,&#8221; said Hibbert-Jones. <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dec. 3 event on campus was initiated by Porter College Provost Sean Keilen, who saw a few minutes of the film-in-progress last year. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;The screening and discussion will the first of several events about veterans that Porter will sponsor in 2015-16,&#8221; Keilen noted. &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;In winter quarter, there will be two new Porter courses, &#8220;War and the Arts,&#8221; and &#8220;Fighting for Words,&#8221; a writing workshop for student veterans. There will also be visits to campus by three well-known organizations that address the consequences of war through the arts: Operation Song, War Ink, and the Afghan Women&#8217;s Writing Project,&#8221; Keilen added. &#160;<br/>

The food drive works in cooperation with Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Cruz County to provide healthy meals to our friends and neighbors in need. The drive runs from now to the winter break.<br/>
 <br/>
 One in four children in our county go through the day without enough to eat. This can impact developmental opportunities as well as long-term health. The people who need calories the most typically get the lowest quality ones available.<br/>
 <br/>
 We are honored to work in cooperation with Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Cruz, the healthiest food bank in the nation. With its buying power, Second Harvest distributes more than 60 percent of its meals in the form of fresh fruits and vegetables. Second Harvest recognizes the importance of eating smart and its long-term connection to the health of our community. Your pantry donations go a long way, but your envelope donations can go further with a lower carbon footprint. One hundred percent of your donation is used to feed people in need in our local community, and just one dollar feeds a family of four.<br/>
 <br/>
 Last year, the UCSC Holiday Food Drive created 150,000 meals for our friends and neighbors in need, making UCSC the third-largest contributor in the county.<br/>
 <br/>
 Please make a donation to support this great cause either by dropping food off in one of our campus pantry barrels or by using the donation envelopes distributed through campus mail.<br/>
 <br/>
 You donations are secure through campus mail services. Donation envelopes are being distributed this week. Please make checks payable to Second Harvest Food Bank and mark your affiliation on the memo line. Keep an eye out for this year's raffle!<br/>
 <br/>

This appointment, which was made earlier this fall, formalizes the half-time position Jaye assumed in 2013 to focus on retention and time-to-degree. The interim appointment will continue through June 30, 2016, or until the career vice provost for student success appointment is made.<br/>
 <br/>
 Jaye is uniquely qualified to undertake this important role as leader for the newly formed Division of Student Success. He has demonstrated exemplary campus leadership in numerous capacities, from his experience as the chair of the Academic Senate's Committee on Educational Policy, to his service as chair of the Linguistics Department, to his strong involvement in the academic life of Stevenson College. His appointment to this new position is a critical part of our broader strategy to strengthen student support in and out of the classroom.<br/>
 <br/>
 As you know, two of my top priorities have been increasing retention rates for undergraduate students and enhancing academic pathways to help students graduate on time. I have been involved in many conversations on these topics across the campus community, and I have received significant feedback about how to strengthen our support for students and their academic achievement, both in the classroom and across student engagement programs. To spur these efforts, I realigned Retention Services, led by Assistant Vice Provost Pablo Reguerin, from Campus Life to the newly formed Division of Student Success. This realignment will refocus the Campus Life organization on student wellness, encompassing student health, Slug Support, sports and recreation, and student conduct.<br/>
 <br/>
 As the campus prepares to increase undergraduate enrollment, requested by state lawmakers and committed to by the Office of the President, it is even more important to ensure that sufficient support is in place for students to be able to graduate on time and that such efforts are consistently coordinated with the work of our academic divisions.<br/>
 <br/>
 Jaye earned a B.A. in linguistics and another one in Russian language from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1985. He received his Ph.D. in linguistics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1991 and was a visiting assistant professor for one year at Yale before joining our campus in 1992.<br/>
 <br/>
 Information about the recruitment process for the position will be provided as available.<br/>
 <br/>
 Please join me in thanking Jaye for taking on this critical role.<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a26b206b8072704638f4f222359c128c"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1325408400000</start-date><path>/2015/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/11/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1420064137294</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1420064137294</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
