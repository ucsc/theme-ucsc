The event will take place on Saturday, October 24, on the UCSC campus.</p>
<p>One of the <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/events.html">campus's 50th-anniversary events</a>, "A History Fair: Cowell Ranch and the land before UCSC" will feature five short talks that focus on the pre-UCSC use of campus lands. A number of local organizations and campus groups will also present displays and activities that focus on local history, especially the effects of past human activity on the land. (Speakers and participating organizations are listed, below.)</p>
<p>"Not only does 2015 mark the 150th anniversary of the Cowell family's arrival in Santa Cruz, it marks the 50th anniversary of UC Santa Cruz's opening," says local historian Frank Perry, who serves as board president of <a href="http://limeworks.ucsc.edu/">UCSC's Cowell Lime Works Friends Group</a>. "The intersection of these two milestone anniversaries in Santa Cruz makes this a perfect time to take a closer look at the legacy of the Cowells in the local area."</p>
<p>Open to the public at no cost, the History Fair will take place from noon to 4 p.m. at the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/03/hay-barn-raising.html">recently "raised" Hay Barn</a> just up the hill from the main entrance to the UCSC campus. The first of the five talks planned will begin at 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Free parking will be available in designated areas on campus near the venue, and refreshments will be available on site.</p>
<p>Perry expects the fair will be of interest to a wide range of community members &#8212; from local history buffs to individuals and families who just want to know more about the history of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Cowell Family's large impact on Santa Cruz area history</strong></p>
<p>Henry Cowell's purchase in 1865 &#8212; 150 years ago &#8212; of half of the lime manufacturing firm of Davis &amp; Jordan was a signature moment in Santa Cruz history. Only 12 years earlier, the company had started making lime &#8212; a key ingredient in mortar and plaster &#8212; from the limerock on what is now the UCSC campus; Cowell's purchase also included half interest in a wharf at the foot of Bay Street.</p>
<p>The lands that are now the UCSC campus were ideal for making lime. Marble bedrock provided the necessary raw material and the old-growth redwood forest was a vast source of fuel for the kilns. The site was also close to the ocean, which made it easy to ship the lime produced in the kilns to San Francisco. San Francisco&#8217;s rapid growth after the gold rush created a huge demand for building materials, including lime.</p>
<p>Cowell also used the lands to raise the horses and oxen which hauled rock, logs, and barrels of lime; to house much of his labor force; and to produce food for workers and livestock. This use of the lands transformed the landscape.</p>
<p>Henry Cowell&#8217;s youngest son, Samuel Henry "Harry" Cowell, was the last link in the Cowell family line. Upon his death in 1955, Harry Cowell made generous gifts to 21 faithful employees and left the rest of the family fortune to the Cowell Foundation to use for the public good &#8212; much of it in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>Not only did the Cowell family's generosity enable the University of California Regents in 1961 to purchase 2,OOO acres of the former Cowell Ranch land for a new campus that four years later would open to its first class of students, the family's generosity helped establish the local redwood state park that bears Henry Cowell's name.</p>
<p><strong>Informal talks, of approximately 20 minutes each, on the following subjects are planned for the inaugural history fair:</strong></p>

<li>2 p.m. &#8212; "Restoring the Cooperage," by Frank Zwart, retired UCSC architect and Friends board member</li>
<li>2:30 p.m. &#8212; "Human impact on the land prior to UCSC," by Chris Lay, curator of UCSC's Kenneth Norris Center for Natural History</li>
<li>3 p.m. &#8212; "Native Land Use Before and After the Missions," by Tsim Schneider, assistant professor of anthropology, UCSC</li>

(Photo by David Williams)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Heart rates of big-wave surfers are among the surprises from 30 years of studying exercise physiology in people and wild animals</article-subhead><article-text><p>For over 30 years, Terrie Williams has been studying exercise physiology in wild animals: African lions and wild dogs, dolphins and whales, coyotes and mountain lions, as well as a few human athletes. She has put mountain lions on treadmills and strapped heart-rate monitors onto big-wave surfers at Mavericks.</p>
<p>These studies have given Williams, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, a unique perspective on exercise and health, which she presents in an article titled "<a href="http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/30/5/349">The Healthy Heart: Lessons from Nature's Elite Athletes</a>," published in the September issue of the journal <em>Physiology</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, you already know the bottom line: Most people should get more exercise. Here are <strong>"Six amazing heart findings"</strong> to contemplate during your next workout:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the highest prolonged heart-rate levels ever recorded was for a professional big-wave surfer riding the monstrous swells at Mavericks: more than 180 beats per minute for three hours, with peaks of 200 beats per minute during rides.</li>
<li>Dogs and cats are opposites in terms of aerobic capacity and maximum heart rate, and humans are more like dogs, adapted for endurance exercise (chasing down prey), while cats are built for the short bursts of speed used in stalk-and-pounce hunting. This difference is reflected in heart size relative to total body mass (larger hearts in dogs and humans, smaller hearts in cats).</li>
<li>The hearts of marathon runners are 10 to 33 percent larger than those of more sedentary people.</li>
<li>Heart disease is exceedingly rare in wild animals, but it is the leading cause of death in humans worldwide. There are many plausible explanations for this, but one factor stands out above all others: the difference in daily activity levels. "We just don't ask our hearts to do very much on a daily basis," Williams said.</li>
<li>The mammalian dive response, automatically triggered by cold water contacting the face, involves an immediate slowing of heart rate and constriction of peripheral blood vessels to maximize blood and oxygen in the core. The mammalian exercise response has the opposite effect, increasing heart rate and metabolism. Thus, marine mammals chasing prey at depth have to balance opposing cardiovascular demands, and Williams found they can experience cardiac arrhythmias during dives.</li>
<li>Heart rate can be consciously controlled, and not just by meditating yogis. A California sea lion was trained to lower its heart rate on command while sitting out of water.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Animals and athletes</strong></p>
<p>For Williams, the main reason to study exercise physiology in animals is to better understand how much energy they have to expend to live in their environments, and how they might be affected by environmental changes and human activities.</p>
<p>Williams is also an athlete herself and has competed in a number of triathlons, so she has always been interested in what humans can learn from nature's elite athletes. "The big difference between wild animals and humans is that they're out there exercising for hours at a time, from the day they're born to the day they die," she said. "My own activity level is pretty pathetic relative to even a lion, and they're not the most active animals. I take a lot out of these lessons from animals in terms of how much and what kinds of exercise I try to do. Mixing it up with both sprints and low-intensity exercise is the secret."</p>
<p>Looking at heart rates in humans, Williams has been struck by the influence of psychological factors, as seen most dramatically in the big-wave surfers. Their high prolonged heart rates (90 percent of maximum based on treadmill tests) are induced by adrenaline, not exercise. "Just sitting on the beach before they entered the water caused the heart rates of surfers to reach almost 180 beats per minute," Williams said.</p>
<p>The same phenomenon is seen in other thrill-seeking sports. Formula race car drivers and motocross racers have also been found to maintain heart rates at 90 percent of maximum for prolonged periods, though not for as long as the surfers.</p>
<p>"The psychological component has tended to be overlooked, but you can really see it in surfers. People do these thrill-seeking sports for the adrenaline rush, and that affects the heart," Williams said.</p>
<p>Is it healthy? "They're in amazing shape overall, and I've never heard of any problems from a prolonged high heart rate unless there's a pre-existing condition. But they can be exhausted for a week after battling the big waves," she said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Marine&#160; mammals</strong></p>
<p>Unlike human surfers, dolphins' heart rates go down when they're riding waves. When Williams was trying to measure heart rates of swimming dolphins, she couldn't keep them from riding her boat's bow wave. "They're not doing it for the thrill; they're just saving energy by taking the easy way out," she said.</p>
<p>The discovery of cardiac arrhythmias in deep-diving marine mammals got Williams thinking about the fact that the swimming segment of triathlons accounts for over 90 percent of race day deaths, especially in cold water venues. The combination of high heart rates at the start of the race (Williams said she knows from experience that the adrenaline is flowing as racers charge into the water) and sudden immersion in cold water is an extreme challenge for the heart. It can be overwhelming for people with pre-existing cardiac conditions, she said. In response, the USA Triathlon organization issued new water temperature guidelines in 2013 for sanctioned events.</p>

Tickets for the event, which will take place from 4 to 7 p.m. in the Australian Rock Garden and Picnic Area, are available <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/JubileeTicketSales.html">online</a>.</p>
<p>The Jubilee will feature live music by local star James Durbin and bluegrass band Jimmy Chickenpants; food and wine; live and silent auctions; garden tours; and presentations honoring long-serving Arboretum staff and volunteers. Fred Keeley, former state assemblyman and county treasurer who is currently leading an effort to establish an open space district in Santa Cruz County, will be the emcee and auctioneer.</p>
<p>"This is an opportunity to celebrate our storied past, raise funds to support student workers at the Arboretum, and honor some of the people who have been so important in our development, who actually planted the plants that are now such lovely specimens," said Jessica Fiske Bailey, executive director of the Arboretum. "We're excited to have Fred Keeley here and to highlight the Arboretum's place in the open space community."</p>
<p><strong>Honorees</strong></p>
<p>The honorees will include Brett Hall, director of collections and conservation, who has worked at the Arboretum for over 40 years, and longtime volunteers Phyllis Norris and Marie Beckham. Together they represent over 115 years of dedicated service to the UCSC Arboretum.</p>
<p>"I have a hard time imagining my life in Santa Cruz County without the Arboretum," Beckham said. "Not only have I had the great joy of seeing the gardens grow into a place of peace and beauty, but I've also had the great pleasure of working with the dedicated, friendly and incredibly knowledgeable staff."</p>
<p>Those who have not visited the Arboretum recently will discover new signs in the gardens, a new patio area around Norrie's gift shop, and other improvements designed to enhance the visitor experience. A total of 12 new informational signs are being installed in the gardens explaining what kinds of plants are growing in each garden, with information about biodiversity, Mediterranean climates, and other topics. A gift from the late Rosemary Raphael, an Arboretum volunteer and longtime supporter, provided funding for the signs.</p>
<p>"It's basic signage we've been needing for ages to make this wonderful collection more accessible to the public," said Hall.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Faculty research</strong></p>
<p>Another new sign that has been popular with visitors, funded in part by a donation from Jean Langenheim, professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology, highlights the work of UC Santa Cruz scientists who have research projects in or relating to the Arboretum.</p>
<p>"We are reaching out to new audiences and strengthening our connections to the campus as a resource for research and education," Bailey said. "Our first fifty years was about building the collections, and now the focus is on making those collections more accessible and getting the word out about how much the Arboretum has to offer to both the campus and the wider community."</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Arboretum got its start with a gift to the campus of rare and unusual eucalyptus trees in 1964. Founding Chancellor Dean McHenry was an enthusiastic supporter and worked closely with the Arboretum's founding director, Ray Collett. Over the past 50 years, the collections have grown to include a wide range of rare, extraordinary, and beautiful plants. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The world's largest collection of Australian plants outside of Australia</li>
<li>The world's largest collection of <em>Dudleya</em> species (a type of succulent)</li>
<li>One of the largest collections of New Zealand plants outside of New Zealand</li>
<li>An important conifer collection used for research and conservation</li>
<li>A growing collection of California native flora</li>
</ul>
<p>These collections are a valuable resource for biodiversity conservation efforts and botanical research. In addition, the UCSC Arboretum has introduced many popular new horticultural varieties to California gardeners over the years.</p>
<p>Now covering 149 acres, the gardens host more than 20,000 visitors annually. Visitors enjoy not only an impressive botanical spectacle, but also an abundance of birds and other wildlife attracted to the site.</p>
<p>Funds raised at the 50th Anniversary Jubilee will be used to support student workers at the Arboretum. Several current student workers will be recognized for their contributions and share stories about their projects.</p>

 <br/>
 <strong>Staff Mentorship Pilot Program</strong><br/>
 The Staff Mentorship Program is a volunteer program that pairs experienced UC Santa Cruz staff from all campus units with newer staff who are seeking to develop themselves professionally. <br/>
 <br/>
 The program provides a supportive structure in which participants can cultivate contacts, explore challenges, and enhance effectiveness as they design their personal growth and career paths at UC Santa Cruz. The program also provides the opportunity to gather information, develop peer support, learn more about the function of UCSC, and better understand campus organizational culture and opportunities. <br/>
 <br/>
 All mentees must be non-represented staff and must have permanent status.<br/>
 <br/>
 For more details, please see the SAB website and <a href="http://sab.ucsc.edu/outreach-committees/mentorship-program.html">mentee application form online</a>.<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Featured Staff of the Month program</strong> <br/>
 If you know a UC Santa Cruz staff member who deserves recognition, please visit the Staff Advisory Board <a href="http://sab.ucsc.edu/outreach-committees/staff-recognition.html">staff recognition web page</a>.<br/>
 <br/>
 All campus staff members are eligible and encouraged to make nominations. We anticipate many staff members will be recognized. If your nominee is not selected this month, don't be discouraged; that person may be selected the following month. You are welcome to submit as many nominations as often as you wish.<br/>
 <br/>
 Featured staff members will be vetted and selected by the Featured Staff Member committee. If selected, a nominee will be asked to participate. If she or he agrees, the staff member will be contacted for a brief biography and interview. The staff member will also be asked to provide a photograph to accompany the story.<br/>
 <br/>
 Stories will be posted on the Staff Advisory Board staff recognition program website. Jeff Rockwell, who&#8217;s been with the university for nearly 26 years, is the <a href="http://sab.ucsc.edu/outreach-committees/staff-recognition.html">inaugural recipient</a>. <strong><br/>

A new study by scientists at UC Santa Cruz shows that elephant seals shed significant amounts of mercury during molting, resulting in elevated concentrations of the toxic metal in coastal waters near the elephant seal rookery at A&#241;o Nuevo State Reserve.</p>
<p>The findings, published September 7 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em>, reveal a previously unrecognized source of mercury contamination in coastal waters.</p>
<p>Mercury is a problem in the marine environment because the most toxic form, methyl mercury, is readily absorbed and accumulates in the bodies of marine organisms. In a process known as "biomagnification," the toxin becomes more and more concentrated as it passes up the food chain. Thus, mercury concentrations in top predators can be 1 million to 10 million times higher than the levels found in seawater.</p>
<p>"Many studies have looked at biomagnification up the food chain, and we took that a step further to see what happens next. Mercury is an element, so it never breaks down and goes away--it just changes forms," said first author Jennifer Cossaboon, who led the study as an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz and is now a graduate student in environmental health at San Diego State University.</p>
<p><strong>Mercury in mussels</strong></p>
<p>A 1981 study by coauthor Russell Flegal, professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology at UC Santa Cruz, had found elevated mercury concentrations in mussels near large colonies of seals and sea lions at A&#241;o Nuevo and San Miguel Island.</p>
<p>"At that time, we didn't have the analytical instruments to detect mercury at the concentrations found in seawater, so we used mussels, which filter seawater, as sentinel organisms," Flegal said. "In the new study, we were able to look at seasonal changes in the water, and during the elephant seal molting season the levels of methyl mercury really took off."</p>
<p>Compared to other coastal sites, the concentration of methyl mercury in the seawater at A&#241;o Nuevo was twice as high during the breeding season and 17 times higher during the molting season. Elephant seals undergo an annual "catastrophic molt" in which they shed the entire outer layer of skin and hair ("pelage"), which comes off in sheets onto the beach. Cossaboon measured high concentrations of mercury in samples of molted pelage collected at A&#241;o Nuevo.</p>
<p>In the earlier study, Flegal had found high concentrations of mercury in sea lion feces, and there is a large sea lion population on A&#241;o Nuevo Island that may also be adding mercury to the coastal waters. Elephant seals are fasting during most of their time on the beach, however, and aren't excreting much at all. The seasonality of the methyl mercury levels at A&#241;o Nuevo implicates molted pelage as the main source. According to Cossaboon, the dramatic increase in methyl mercury in the water during the molting season resulted in levels greater than those observed even in the highly urbanized San Francisco Bay estuary.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Industrial emissions</strong></p>
<p>Industrial emissions, mostly from the burning of coal, have increased the amount of mercury in the marine environment two- to four-fold over preindustrial levels, and global emissions are expected to continue increasing for at least the next several decades, according to Flegal. "This internal recycling back into the coastal environment just adds to the problem," he said.</p>
<p>A related study published earlier this year by another group of researchers at UC Santa Cruz found that mercury concentrations in the blood and muscle of elephant seals were among the highest concentrations ever reported for a marine predator. <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1810/20150710">Published June 17, 2015, in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em></a>, the study found that the mercury levels varied with the hunting strategies of the seals, which were tracked during their foraging migrations throughout the North Pacific Ocean using satellite tags. The highest concentrations of mercury were found in elephant seals that foraged offshore and at the greatest depths. The lowest concentrations were in seals foraging in Northern coastal waters.</p>
<p>According to first author Sarah Peterson, a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology, 99 percent of the animals studied had blood mercury levels that exceeded the threshold for clinical neurotoxicity in humans. "It is important, however, to be cautious in trying to use that threshold for another species," Peterson said. "We do not know what these concentrations mean for elephant seals."</p>
<p>According to Flegal, studying the neurological effects of mercury in humans is extremely difficult, and in a wild animal population it is almost impossible.</p>
<p>Peterson is also first author of a <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00244-015-0174-3">recent paper</a> evaluating hair samples as an indicator of blood mercury levels in four pinniped species, including northern elephant seals and California sea lions. This study also found that mercury levels in elephant seal hair were quite high, she said, and higher than levels in hair from California sea lions that were sampled just off the mainland at A&#241;o Nuevo Island. Peterson's coauthors on both papers include Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, and Joshua Ackerman, a U.S. Geological Survey wildlife biologist.</p>
<p>In addition to Cossaboon and Flegal, the <em>PNAS</em> paper was coauthored by Priya Ganguli, who is now at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. This research was supported with funding from Stevenson College (UC Santa Cruz), the Dr. Earl H.

<p>That she was the lone female faculty member in natural sciences at the new UC Santa Cruz campus was remarkable enough. But the fact Langenheim was actually teaching a class on the ecology of redwoods, not in a classroom but beneath a starry sky and under a stand of the towering trees, was even more notable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was convinced this informal atmosphere of learning in the field and the relationships students and faculty shared there often inspired life-long environmental interests,&#8221; said the now 90-year-old Langenheim.</p>
<p>It was that freedom to teach in unconventional ways and engage in research among a close-knit faculty that attracted Langenheim to the Santa Cruz campus in 1966. Many of the pioneering teachers and staff who came to UC Santa Cruz between 1964 and 1967 would be drawn by the same thing.</p>
<p>Born out of the vision of then-UC President Clark Kerr and Dean McHenry, a former UCLA political science professor who was named the first chancellor of the new campus, UC Santa Cruz was to be a grand experiment in education.</p>
<p>It proposed knocking down the walls of a stodgy bureaucracy, encouraging innovation, and allowing students the intimacy of a small college within a large research institution.</p>
<p>But it was the early staff and faculty &#8212; many of which came from places like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and even Kings College at Cambridge University &#8212; who actually carried out the plan and, in the process, established the roots of what UC Santa Cruz is today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody wanted to come. It was the talk of the country,&#8221; said Todd Newberry, a Stanford-trained professor of biology who arrived at the university in 1965. &#8220;How many times in your life do you get to start a university? It was going to focus on undergrads, and that&#8217;s where my heart was.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campus attracted new thinkers like a horseback-riding historian from UCLA named Page Smith, the charismatic art history professor Mary Holmes, the brilliant history professor and WWII veteran William Hitchcock, and the gangly Harvard-trained Byron Stookey Jr., who would become head of academic planning for UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The hires were old, young, liberal, and conservative. Some came with impressive bodies of work. Other put their academic careers in jeopardy by arriving at an institution that put an emphasis on undergraduate teaching rather than on being published. They played sports with students, ate with students, invited them into their homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course it was exceptional and we knew it and a lot of people felt it,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz pioneer History Professor John Dizikes in his oral history. &#8220;And (Cowell College founding Provost) Page Smith propagated overwhelmingly the idea shared by most of us, to a great degree, that we were now going to help with the reform of American higher education.&#8221;</p>
<p>And reform they did.</p>
<p>One of the first revolutionary acts of the faculty was to toss out letter grades in favor of a pass/fail system with narrative evaluations. The move was urged by Smith, who believed letter grades created a competitive situation where some students prospered at the expense of others and had no place in learning.</p>
<p>Or as the flamboyant pioneer Art History Professor Jasper Rose reportedly said, &#8220;Students are not vegetables. We don&#8217;t need to grade them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nancy Pascal, who worked in the Registrar&#8217;s Office starting in 1966, remembered the faculty writing evaluations of students on &#8220;sticky labels, and then we&#8217;d get the labels and we&#8217;d paste them onto the right student&#8217;s records. Later the college staff would have to retype them, so there was this huge effort to support the narrative evaluation for students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, many of those who gave &#8212; and received &#8212; these narrative assessments say they were one of the best parts of UC Santa Cruz, a concrete sign that teachers were actually paying attention to students.</p>
<p>Besides a lack of grades, there were other indications the early faculty and staff weren't creating your father&#8217;s university.</p>
<p>There were weekly &#8220;college nights,&#8221; where faculty, staff, and students sat down to a semi-formal dinner with stimulating guest speakers like beat poet Allen Ginsberg, writer/activist Susan Sontag, writer Ana&#239;s Nin, and jazz musician Don Ellis.</p>
<p>There were thought-provoking college courses, which pressed against the boundaries of traditional teaching. Newberry co-taught a college course on death and another on the sense of place. Courses on building a house, on dreams, and on national identity were offered.</p>
<p>Harry Berger, a literature professor who came to UC Santa Cruz from Yale in 1965 and went on to become a respected literary and cultural critic, also remembered Cowell&#8217;s famous core course on world civilization. The course included seminars led, not just by humanities professors, but also, in this new world of learning, by biologists, economists, political scientists, and chemists &#8212; many who found themselves in unfamiliar territory.</p>
<p>&#8220;It encouraged and supported team-teaching,&#8221; Berger said of the experience. &#8220;It made it easy for people in different fields to teach together. I team-taught courses with classicists, anthropologists, and sociologists&#8230; . For me, this meant that I was not only a teacher of undergraduates but also a student of my colleagues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the faculty and staff found themselves improvising, inventing, and tackling assignments they&#8217;d never imagined.</p>
<p>Pioneer professor of psychology and sociology Bill Domhoff organized a two-day, all-campus &#8220;culture break&#8221; during those first years. He brought in folklorist Alan Dundes, who gave a talk on the psychology of elephant jokes, and recruited an expert who spoke on drugs and creativity. There were talks on dreams, screenings of Ingmar Bergman movies, and construction of a fake beach, complete with lifeguard, on the East Field.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beauty of it turned out to be that students learned to think for themselves and to be more creative,&#8221; Domhoff said of the event he dubbed &#8220;The Fantasy Festival.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the times were already changing. Student protests over the Vietnam War and Civil Rights rattled the campus, and the weight of overturning old systems began to take a toll.</p>
<p>Faculty discovered themselves overwhelmed by the workloads of both the colleges and what were called boards of studies. Some of the campus&#8217;s brightest teachers were denied tenure because the entrenched UC advancement system didn&#8217;t take into account the new campus&#8217;s values. Political pressures mounted. Some of the old ways crept back in.</p>
<p>But one of the things that remained was UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s maverick spirit, an attitude that fostered improbable campus achievements like being the first to sequence the human genome, saving the endangered Peregrine falcon from extinction, finding new ways to peer more deeply into space, and helping to put organic food on American tables.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;&#8230;You walk across campus now and there are all those energetic, interested young people who are finding their way in life and learning,&#8221; said Jerry Walters, a pioneering staff member whose job included the daunting task of housing 652 students after construction delays meant they had nowhere to live. &#8220;And then, there are the discoveries and other things going on (at UC Santa Cruz) that don&#8217;t just have local impact but have national and worldwide impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man who retired as executive director of housing, dining, and childcare paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it just makes me proud.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ada563588072701721067acfe75ca06d"><name>faggin-chair</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gift to UC Santa Cruz funds new presidential chair for physics of information</title><summary>Endowed chair established by Federico Faggin, a physicist who developed the first commercial microprocessor. </summary><keywords>Federico Faggin, physics of information, endowed chair, Presidential Chair</keywords><start-date>1441695600000</start-date><display-name>Gift funds new presidential chair for physics of information</display-name><path>/2015/09/faggin-chair</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/09/faggin-chair</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1441727341365</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1441727752844</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/faggins-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/faggins-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>faggins-400.jpg</name><display-name>faggins-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>71601</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>Federico and Elvia Faggin</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/federico-faggin-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/federico-faggin-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>federico-faggin-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>federico-faggin-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19251</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Federico Faggin</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Federico and Elvia Faggin</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Federico Faggin, physicist who developed the first microprocessor, establishes endowment to support an important new direction in physics research </article-subhead><article-text><strong><strong>&#65279;</strong></strong> 
<p>UC Santa Cruz has received a $500,000 gift from physicist and technology innovator Federico Faggin, plus matching funds from the UC Regents, to establish a $1 million endowment for the <strong>Faggin Family Presidential Chair for the Physics of Information</strong>.</p>
<p>The endowed chair will support the research and teaching of a UC Santa Cruz faculty member studying fundamental questions at the interface of physics and related fields including mathematics, complex systems, biophysics, and cognitive science, with the unifying theme of information in physics.</p>
<p>"We're excited because this is the first endowed chair in physics at UC Santa Cruz, and the funding will have a significant impact," said Robert Johnson, professor and chair of the Physics Department. Increasing support for endowed chairs is a goal of the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>, which has raised more than $210 million for the campus.</p>
<p><strong>First microprocessor</strong></p>
<p>Faggin is widely known for developing the first commercial microprocessor (the Intel 4004). Born in Italy, he moved to Silicon Valley in 1968 and worked at Fairchild Semiconductor, where he helped develop silicon gate technology and the first silicon gate integrated circuit. At Intel, he directed the design of all of the company's early microprocessors. He went on to found several successful Silicon Valley companies, including Cygnet Technologies, Synaptics, and Foveon. Faggin received the 2009 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the highest honor the United States confers for achievements related to technological progress, as well as many other awards and honors.</p>
<p>UCSC physics professor Anthony Aguirre has known Faggin for several years and is a cofounder of the <a href="http://fqxi.org/">Foundational Questions Institute</a> (FQXi), which organized an international conference on the physics of information in 2014.</p>
<p>"He attended the conference and met a lot of the people who are active in this emerging field," Aguirre said. "Researchers are finding that considering physical systems as being predominantly about the dynamics of information is yielding interesting insights. This way of thinking, which is likely grow in the future, connects with a number of fields and touches on important interdisciplinary problems."</p>
<p><strong>Fundamental questions</strong></p>
<p>Scientists are applying ideas from information theory to fundamental questions in physics and investigating the role of information in quantum mechanics, cosmology, thermodynamics, life, and consciousness.</p>
<p>"The physics of information is a very important new direction in physics. We live in a special time when physics is rethinking many fundamental concepts," Faggin said.</p>
<p>Faggin is currently president of the <a href="http://www.fagginfoundation.org/">Federico and Elvia Faggin Foundation</a>, which supports research to advance the understanding of consciousness. His son Marc Faggin graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2002 with degrees in chemistry and mathematics.</p>

Astronomers use distinctive observational signatures to detect these events, but they are not seeing nearly as many tidal disruption events as theory says they should.</p>
<p>A recent study by UC Santa Cruz researchers suggests that astronomers might be missing many of these events because of how the streams of shredded stars fall onto the black hole. James Guillochon, who earned his Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz and is now at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics, based their analysis on a series of computer simulations of tidal disruption events. They reported their findings in a paper published August 20 in the <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/809/2/166">Astrophysical Journal</a>.</p>
<p>When a black hole tears a star apart, the star's material is stretched out into what's known as a tidal stream. That stream continues on a trajectory around the black hole, with roughly half the material eventually falling back on the black hole, whipping around it in a series of orbits. Where those orbits intersect each other, the material smashes together and circularizes, forming a disk that then accretes onto the black hole.</p>
<p>Astronomers don't observe anything until after the tidal streams collide and the material begins to accrete onto the black hole. At that point, they observe a sudden peak in luminosity, which then gradually decreases as the tail end of what's left of the star accretes and the black hole's food source eventually runs out.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;General relativity</strong></p>
<p>So why have astronomers only been observing about a tenth as many tidal disruption events (TDEs) as theory predicts they should see? By studying the structure of tidal streams in TDEs, Guillochon and Ramirez-Ruiz have found a potential reason, and the culprit is general relativity.</p>
<p>"It is an effect of general relativity that is modulating the digestion process of the black hole, so the digestion rate depends strongly on the mass of the black hole," Ramirez-Ruiz said.</p>
<p>The researchers ran a series of simulations of tidal disruption events around black holes of varying masses and spins to see what form the resulting tidal streams take over time. They found that precession of the tidal stream due to the black hole's gravitational effects changes how the stream interacts with itself, and therefore what astronomers observe. Some cases behave as expected for what's currently considered a "typical" event, but some do not.</p>
<p>For cases where the relativistic effects are small (such as black holes with masses less than a few million solar masses), the tidal stream collides with itself after only a few windings around the black hole, quickly forming a disk &#8212; but the disk forms far from the black hole, so it takes a long time to accrete. As a result, the observed flare can take 100 times longer to peak than typically expected, so these sources may not be identified as tidal disruption events.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for cases where the black hole is both massive and has a spin greater than a certain value (about 20 percent of its maximum allowed spin), the tidal stream doesn't collide with itself right away. Instead, it can take many windings around the black hole before the first intersection. In these cases, it may potentially be years after a star gets ripped apart before the material accretes and astronomers are able to observe the event.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b2c3c5118072701721067acfc9e69e85"><name>imsd-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Long-running UC Santa Cruz program supports diversity in biomedical sciences</title><summary>Renewal of NIH grant provides $4 million for program supporting underrepresented minority students in biomedical fields.</summary><keywords>IMSD Program, Melissa Jurica, Laura Jimenez, Sharon Idiga</keywords><start-date>1441782000000</start-date><display-name>Long-running UC Santa Cruz program supports diversity in biomedical sciences</display-name><path>/2015/09/imsd-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/09/imsd-program</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1441813218544</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1442260488972</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/laura-jimenez-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/laura-jimenez-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>laura-jimenez-400.jpg</name><display-name>laura-jimenez-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>105155</file-size><width>400</width><height>395</height></image><image-alt>Laura Jimenez in lab coat with pipette</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/laura-jimenez-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/laura-jimenez-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>laura-jimenez-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>laura-jimenez-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23590</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Laura Jimenez in lab coat</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Laura Jimenez graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2009 and is now finishing up a Ph.D. in oncological sciences at the University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute.

But IMSD's eight-week summer workshop on laboratory research changed her mind.</p>
<p>"I was just going to do research to put it on my resume, but as soon as I got started I fell in love with it," said Idiga, who graduated from UC Santa Cruz in June with a degree in molecular, cell and developmental (MCD) biology. She is starting graduate school in molecular and cellular biology at the University of Iowa this fall.</p>
<p>"At the beginning of that summer, I was telling everyone no way I was going to graduate school, and by the end of the summer I was really thinking about it," she said.</p>
<p>That's the kind of outcome the IMSD program aims for, said director Melissa Jurica, a professor of MCD biology. The program's main goal is to increase the number of underrepresented minority students who receive Ph.D. degrees in the biomedical sciences and related fields. According to Jurica, many undergraduates, especially underrepresented minorities, don't have a clear idea of what it means to be a scientist and what the career opportunities are.</p>
<p>"This program can turn a student's life in a direction they never thought possible," she said.</p>
<p>That was certainly true for Laura Jimenez, who earned her B.S. in MCD biology at UC Santa Cruz in 2009 and is now finishing up a Ph.D. in oncological sciences at the University of Utah while working in a paid internship at Genentech.</p>
<p>"If it wasn't for IMSD, I wouldn't be in graduate school," Jimenez said. "It opened up my eyes to a side of science and medicine that I wasn't aware of -- the idea that I could do research and contribute to people's lives through the work I do at the lab bench."</p>
<p><strong>Supportive community</strong></p>
<p>Jimenez grew up in a small agricultural town in the Central Valley and was the first in her family to go to college. She said the IMSD program gave her a supportive community, exposure to research, mentoring, and guidance through the graduate school application process. "It helped me build confidence in myself and identify with being in a research career," she said. "Some of the graduate students who mentored me were Latinos and the first in their family to go to college, and that inspired me."</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been supporting the IMSD program at UC Santa Cruz since 1999, and for ten years before that when it was known as the Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) program. The program's grant was renewed again this year, providing over $800,000 per year for the next five years. The Division of Physical and Biological Sciences provides additional funding as well as staff support through the division's <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/">STEM Diversity Office</a>.</p>
<p>IMSD supports both undergraduates and graduate students. The program currently funds 23 undergraduates in their junior and senior years (covering their salaries for lab research), and provides tuition and stipends for 11 graduate students (9 funded by the IMSD grant and two funded by the Graduate Division). The undergraduate program starts with the intensive summer training institute, then gives students the opportunity for real research experience in a faculty laboratory. Idiga, for example, did research in the lab of Pradip Mascharak, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and coauthored a paper in a scientific journal, with another paper pending. "I had great mentors and really felt like I was part of the research lab," she said.</p>
<p>For both undergrads and graduate students, the IMSD program provides workshops, career advice, personal counseling, and a supportive and welcoming community for underrepresented minority students. "As an African American and a woman in the sciences, I didn't see a lot of people who looked like me in my classes, so it was nice to be part of a close scientific community with people who were more like me," Idiga said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Peer mentoring</strong></p>
<p>Finding a cohort of peers for advice and support is an essential ingredient for the success of both undergraduates and graduate students, said Blake Riggs, who earned a B.S. in marine biology and a Ph.D. in MCD biology at UC Santa Cruz, with support from IMSD as a graduate student. Now an assistant professor of cell and molecular biology at San Francisco State University, Riggs has studied the role of near peer mentoring in improving outcomes of traditionally underrepresented students in STEM. "We found that with near peer mentoring, our mentors showed as many benefits as the mentees," he said.</p>
<p>Riggs, one of 35 IMSD alumni now in faculty and other leadership positions at institutions around the country, said that increasing faculty diversity will help drive increased participation of minorities in STEM-related research careers. "The way to raise diversity in the sciences is to raise the representation of minorities on the faculty," he said.</p>
<p>According to Jurica, underrepresented minorities make up a growing proportion of students in biomedical majors at UC Santa Cruz, now accounting for more than one-third of declared and proposed majors. The IMSD program has an important role to play in helping those students to succeed at UCSC and ultimately pursue careers in biomedical research, she said.</p>
<p>"The number of undergraduates in our program who enter graduate school directly has been on an upward trajectory, close to 50 percent in the last two years," Jurica said. "We're continuing to improve the program to better serve our students, and at the same time our population of students is growing, so we need to keep growing the program."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UC Santa Cruz STEM Diversity Programs</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b3b35d248072701721067acffdbcf913"><name>khanh-nguyen-pister-honoree</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pister Award winner rises from poverty, works to save lives </title><summary>Khanh Nguyen is heading to UC Santa Cruz to study biochemistry.

<p>All she will tell him is that they succumbed to disease in Malaysia because there wasn&#8217;t the right kind of medicine in the communist camp where they lived.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dad left after my second brother was lost,&#8221; says Nguyen, 22. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t think the third pregnancy would work out, so he left and, miraculously, I survived.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Nguyen is headed to UC Santa Cruz to study biochemistry and eventually become a physician with the goal of working for the World Health Organization in order to help people like his family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a doctor has always been my calling,&#8221; says Nguyen who hopes to graduate in 2017. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never doubted it.</p>
<p>A recipient of the $20,000, two-year Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Award, Nguyen&#8217;s story of perseverance is awash in tragedy, hard luck, and equally hard work.</p>
<p>Tossed out of the communist camp after its closure in 1994, Nguyen and his mother were left without a home or a country. They fled to his mother&#8217;s native Vietnam but were forced to leave because of an abusive living situation and finally found themselves in Salinas, California, where his mother worked a series of low-income jobs in order to support her small family.</p>
<p>Jobs were won and then lost. Landlords preyed on the family because Nguyen&#8217;s mother did not speak English.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was forced to grow up very soon,&#8221; remembers Nguyen, who pushed himself to learn English in order to help his mother. By the time he was in third grade, he was the one filling out school forms for himself and his younger brother, signing permission slips, and even helping his mother file her taxes.</p>
<p>Struggling with poverty, bullied because of his culture, and grappling with the growing knowledge that he was gay, Nguyen found himself facing a choice to give up or to move forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mom never gave up,&#8221; says Nguyen. &#8220;She followed her dreams and even though her dreams didn&#8217;t work out, she didn&#8217;t quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t either.</p>
<p>Inspired by a visit to his high school by Oscar-winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black (&#8220;Milk,&#8221; &#8220;J. Edgar&#8221;), Nguyen &#8212; who&#8217;d only recently come out &#8212; decided to form a Gay-Straight Alliance on campus in order to create a safe place for people like himself.</p>
<p>He also took advanced classes in school, earned good grades, and spent a Rotary-supported year abroad becoming fluent in Japanese. He began to apply to colleges.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was only then that my mom sat me down and told me we couldn&#8217;t afford for me to go to college,&#8221; Nguyen said. &#8220;It was heartbreaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, Nguyen landed at Hartnell College in Salinas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Khanh was born in adversity and his whole journey has been a series of adverse circumstances,&#8221; says Bronwyn Moreno, MESA program director at Hartnell College. &#8220;But it is almost like a sword forged in the fire.&#160; Everything he has endured has made him the person he is today. &#8221;</p>
<p>At Hartnell, Nguyen joined the Math Club, taking math games into elementary schools to help children develop a love of the discipline. He also was awarded two math internships in Mexico, studying the Fibonacci sequence at the Centro de Investigaci&#243;n en Matem&#225;ticas and prime numbers that could be used for Internet security at the Universidad Nacional Aut&#243;noma de M&#233;xico.</p>
<p>As part of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s STEM Diversity program, he also recently spent his summer working at various biomedical research labs on campus and will begin classes in the fall.</p>
<p>"He is so committed to making the world a better place, he will do whatever he needs to get where he wants to be,&#8221; Moreno said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b4452fa48072701721067acf8e2071aa"><name>barn-dedication</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pie potluck, barn dance mark Cowell Ranch Hay Barn dedication Saturday, Sept. 12</title><summary>A pie potluck and barn dance will be featured at the dedication of the newly rebuilt Cowell Ranch Hay Barn that will soon become a multi-use teaching, office and event space, and headquarters for the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems at UC Santa Cruz.</summary><start-date>1441838340000</start-date><display-name>Hay barn dedication</display-name><path>/2015/09/barn-dedication</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/09/barn-dedication</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1441838477186</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1442280045160</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/barn-9-4-15-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/barn-9-4-15-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>barn-9-4-15-500.jpg</name><display-name>barn-9-4-15-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>110215</file-size><width>500</width><height>375</height></image><image-alt>Cowell Ranch Hay Barn</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/barn-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/barn-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>barn-80.jpg</name><display-name>barn-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>15804</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Cowell Ranch Hay Barn</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Cowell Ranch Hay Barn pictured on Friday, Sept. 4 awaiting the pouring of concrete at the entrance and along the west side.

<p>The event is <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3157">scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. Saturday, September 12</a> at the restored barn near the base of campus. It is free and the public is invited; drinks will be provided. A live band and dancing will follow dedication ceremonies. Parking is available at the Barn Theater at the campus entrance.</p>
<p>Dozens of community volunteers including members of the Santa Cruz Construction Guild who helped raise the barn&#8217;s framework in a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/03/hay-barn-raising.html">one-day barn raising</a> in March are invited as are members of the many building trades who have worked on the project.</p>
<p>The restoration of the 150-year-old barn has been a long time coming and has involved countless individuals who have taken an interest in its central role in the Cowell Lime Works Historic District. The project was made possible with a $5 million grant from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation.</p>
<p>Period construction techniques &#8211; mortise and tenon joinery -- from the 1860s are used to tie together the superstructure made up of new timbers as well as others salvaged from the original that was carefully dismantled last year.</p>
<p>The new barn is also engineered and constructed with modern materials for safety and environmental concerns.</p>
<p>Phase one of the project is nearly complete. Future work includes finishing interior spaces for offices, a conference room, kitchen, and storage, along with landscaping, &#160;including a path to the UC Santa Cruz farm where apprentices in the ecological horticulture program learn sustainable agriculture.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/03/hay-barn-raising.html</url><title>Previous coverage</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b47088928072701721067acf441a30dd"><name>wildlife-on-campus</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pumas, raccoons and snakes, oh my</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz students can walk out of a classroom and, in a few minutes, be in the same territory with nearly 50 species of mammals, legions of birds, and scores of salamanders, newts and snakes.&#13;

<p>It&#8217;s the silk-lined entrance to the den of a California Turret Spider, one of the campus&#8217; most secretive invertebrates. The spider, Miller explains, not only can live for a mind-boggling 16 years but also can molt into a smaller size when food is scarce. It rarely emerges from its den.&#160;</p>
<p>That a student can walk out of a classroom and, in a few minutes, be in the same territory with an enigmatic arachnid, nearly 50 species of mammals, legions of birds, and scores of salamanders, newts and snakes, is what makes UC Santa Cruz unique among most universities, says Miller, who serves as steward of the campus&#8217; 410-acre Natural Reserve.</p>
<p>And while there may be no official ranking for college campuses with the largest amount and diversity of wildlife, Chris Lay, manager of the Kenneth S. Norris Center for Natural History, guesses Santa Cruz would most likely be one of the top contenders for the as-yet non-existent title.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;I feel pretty confident,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that there aren&#8217;t many other campuses that have a 361-page book on the natural history of its land.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miller &#8212; a former bartender, commercial fisherman and ranch hand who got his degree in environmental studies from UC Santa Cruz in 2015 &#8212; is carrying the book &#8220;The Natural History of the UC Santa Cruz Campus&#8221; under his arm as he walks into the redwood and madrone forest of the upper campus.</p>
<p>He talks about the &#8220;smart and crafty&#8221; raccoons that raid campus trashcans and compost piles, the western and eastern grey squirrels that have trails high in trees, and the Peninsula dusky-footed woodrat whose lodges may include a bedroom, nursery, pantry and latrine.</p>
<p>Pumas (which Miller has only seen via hidden cameras), foxes, coyotes, bobcats, and long-tailed weasels wander the campus at night and in the early morning hours, while California ground squirrels can be seen popping in and out of the openings of their 50- to 200-foot-long meadow burrows most of the day. &#160;The females form matriarchal colonies and share burrows while the solitary males have their own dens nearby.</p>
<p>Squirrels and reptiles &#8212; there are 18 reptile species on campus and Miller counts rubber boas and forest sharp-tailed snakes as his favorite &#8212; draw raptors like red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, and Peregrine falcons to the site.</p>
<p>Miller recounts how once, as he was riding his bike through the Great Meadow, he witnessed two powerful golden eagles fighting in the dust over a ground squirrel that one had caught.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get to see that on most college campuses,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Lay talks of taking one of his classes to watch a barn owl near the Arboretum, of observing that area&#8217;s famous hummingbirds, of hearing the warning cries of tiny bushtits as a Cooper&#8217;s Hawk flew overhead. The daring Cooper&#8217;s hawk is known for capturing other birds in mid-flight.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the rare things we see on campus is the Empire Cave Spider which is only found in the Cave Gulch area of UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Lay says. Tiny Cave Gulch Pseudoscorpions are also found only on campus, along with the dazzling-green Ohlone Tiger Beetle that is endemic to Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>There are bats, newts and Pacific giant salamanders which can bite and also prey on UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s school mascot, the Banana Slug, whose bright yellow, slimy bodies can be spotted in shady ravines on campus.</p>
<p>Students may come across black-tailed deer as they head to class, hear the skitter of western fence lizards and brilliantly hued skinks as they pass and, sometimes, scent the smelly calling card of a striped skunk. And, if they look around their feet they may see animal tracks, scat, and trails that hint at the presence of the four-legged university dwellers in their midst.</p>
<p>&#8220;This campus is so unique, so rare and so beautiful,&#8221; Miller says and, with all the chances to observe wildlife, it&#8217;s like being in a living laboratory.</p>
<p>In fact, the campus&#8217; diversity of wildlife led to the formation of a student-run Natural History Club, which plans regular explorations in forest and meadow. There are also plenty of internships that put students into contact with wildlife, including the onomatopoeic &#8220;Herps on the FERP,&#8221; which allows students to do herpetology monitoring on the Forest Ecology Research Plot (FERP).</p>
<p>Find a spot, sit still and watch. Promises Miller: &#8220;You&#8217;ll find things you never thought you&#8217;d see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#160;SOME RULES FOR NATURE WATCHING:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be patient. Sit in one spot for a length of time and watch the behaviors of the wildlife you see.</li>
<li>Be quiet. Noise and loud talking will cause some animals to take cover.</li>
<li>Listen. A rustle in the bushes or birdcall will alert you to life nearby.</li>
<li>Check the time. Early morning and evening hours are often the best time to spot wildlife.</li>
<li>Narrow your focus. Stop and look out a few feet from where you stand. You may be amazed at the life you see.</li>
<li>Make observations about what you see. What is the animal doing? How is it acting? What is the habitat around it?</li>
<li>Do not touch or approach wildlife &#8212; for your safety and theirs.</li>

I want to add value to someone's life,&#8221; says James Harris, a U.S.&#160; Army veteran, now an apprentice at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), the farm program at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
 Harris is one of three former service members enrolled in the internationally recognized Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture this year. Others are Jose Ortega, who served in the Air Force in Afghanistan, and Margaret Goolsby, who retired from a successful career in the Army.<br/>
<br/>
 For many soldiers transitioning to civilian life, agriculture is an appealing career option. Farmers and soldiers share many of the same character traits: They are disciplined, resolute, determined, purposeful, and resilient.<br/>
<br/>
 But to Harris and other veteran farmers, including notable CASFS alumnus and a vet himself, Matthew Raiford (2011), a career in agriculture allows them to continue serving their country by working the land they once protected. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;You are serving the community in a similar way,&#8221; Goolsby observes.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Feeding people is a cause bigger than yourself, &#8220; says Michael O&#8217;Gorman, founder of Farmer Veteran Coalition (FVC), a nonprofit now in Davis that helps former soldiers acclimate to post military life through agriculture.<br/>
<br/>
 Harris, and Ortega came to CASFS because of FVC, originally organized in Santa Cruz and with close ties to the UC Santa Cruz farm. FVC also encouraged Raiford to enroll in the program and has given scholarships to Harris and Ortega.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Post 9/11 world</strong><br/>
<br/>
 The Farmer Veteran Coalition legacy grew from the people they now help. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 On September 19, 2001, a week after the 9/11 attacks, Harris enlisted in the U.S. Army. He was 19 and living in South Carolina. &#8220;I knew I had to do something bigger with my life,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Everything was different. You knew your were going to war. You had to prepare for that.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 O&#8217;Gorman&#8217;s son also joined the military after 9/11. O&#8217;Gorman&#8217;s daughter was at ground zero when the World Trade Center towers were hit. She witnessed the devastation and was left traumatized, O&#8217;Gorman says. It impacted the family deeply.<br/>
<br/>
 O&#8217;Gorman, who describes himself as a lifelong pacifist, was a farmer for nearly 40 years in farms across California, including Jacob&#8217;s Farm in Pescadero. He does not have a military background but like many people during the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, was emotionally impacted by the combat overseas. It troubled him and he wanted to do something for soldiers like Harris and his son who returned from war needing work.<br/>
<br/>
 O&#8217;Gorman found his calling during a visit to New York City in 2005. He was at the United Nations headquarters and saw Let Us Beat Swords into Plowshares, the famous bronze sculpture that shows a man molding a sword into the blade of a plow. Biblical in origin, the concept is a call of action to end war and create instead of destroy. O&#8217;Gorman was inspired by the statue&#8217;s fighting to farming allegory. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 O&#8217;Gorman called his agricultural allies into action. A small group gathered one afternoon a few miles north of the UCSC campus at the Swanton Berry Farm in Davenport. In attendance was UCSC alumnus Mark Lipson (Merrill, &#8216;81, environmental studies). Like O&#8217;Gorman, Lipson felt a similar urgency. &#8220;I felt compelled to find a way of responding constructively to the consequences of U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Healing mission</strong><br/>
<br/>
 For many veterans, agriculture offers a purposefulness that can be profoundly healing. &#8220;Farming offers a satisfying mission, one integrating multiple skills, self-reliance, and for many a therapeutic effect,&#8221; Lipson says. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Farming is about nurturing,&#8221; says Raiford. &#8220;Part of healing is a process of nurturing.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 After leaving the army, Harris had problems with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. &#8220;I was hit by a lot of IEDs, (improvised explosive devices),&#8221; he recalls about his time in Kirkuk, a city in the north of Iraq. It was hard for Harris to adjust to civilian life.<br/>
<br/>
 But it was in farming that Harris found peace. He volunteered at an elderly facility and noticed that when he would take disabled residents into the garden he'd see their faces&#160; &#8220;light up.&#8221; &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;If it works for them, it will work for me.&#8221; Harris remembers thinking. The rest is history.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Farming (especially organic farming) needs these people, who understand a mission-driven approach, appreciate the uses and limits of machinery and technology, and are not daunted by the difficulties and setbacks that farming inevitably brings,&#8221; Lipson says.<br/>
<br/>
 To Harris, it&#8217;s more than being in the dirt. &#8220;It&#8217;s taking a seed, putting it in the ground, and watching it grow. The change is tangible. To be part of that is amazing.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b97402e48072701721067acf42ebe0b8"><name>mary-zavanelli-feature</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Iron Will</title><summary>As a veteran marathoner and Iron Man competitor, Mary Zavanelli is used to competition.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>The shivering started halfway through the 112-mile bike ride.</p>
<p>Mary Zavanelli, a teaching professor of biology at UC Santa Cruz, had already completed a 2.4-mile swim and was anticipating a 26.2-mile run but the uncontrolled shaking that ran through her body in the 95-degree Hawaiian heat was unexpected.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was fighting the winds, which was annoying, and when the shivering started, I knew I was going into heat stress,&#8221; Zavanelli said of her participation in the 2001 Ironman World Championship triathlon on the Big Island of Hawaii. &#8220;I pulled off the road and sat under a bush and drank all the water I had and ate a Power bar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she got back on her bike, completed the marathon-length run and crossed the finish line in a little over 16 hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;You learn a lot about yourself when you&#8217;re out there. I guess I&#8217;m just too stubborn to quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zavanelli says this as she sits in an upholstered recliner in her Santa Cruz home. Her hands rest still in her lap, her legs are motionless against the raised footrest.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Zavenelli, 60, was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that robs its sufferers of movement, speech and eventually breath. Baseball player Lou Gehrig and physicist Stephen Hawking made it famous. Only about two people out of 100,000 are diagnosed with the disease each year and most are given a life expectancy of two to five years. There is no cure.</p>
<p>For Zavanelli, who taught last year from a wheelchair and plans to return to the classroom this fall, living with ALS is not much different than facing the rigors of an Ironman triathlon.</p>
<p>&#8220;You just deal with things as they come up,&#8221; she says. &#8220;There are so many things in an Ironman you can&#8217;t control. So if you get a flat tire or the wind comes up you just change your strategy. You deal with it. You have to basically get over yourself, get over the &#8216;oh, poor me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Zavanelli came to UC Santa Cruz in 1994. She&#8217;d worked in hematology, oncology and neurobiology labs &#8212; ironically studying nerve muscle junction failure.&#160; At Santa Cruz, she taught a variety of courses, including the popular classes on female physiology and the biology of AIDS.</p>
<p>Zavanelli also was a key researcher in a 2007 study published by Terrie Williams, UC Santa Cruz professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, which looked at how seals, dolphins and whales protect their brains from conditions of low oxygen while swimming underwater for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Zavanelli developed the lab techniques used to measure the amounts and types of oxygen-carrying proteins, called globins, in animal brains.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zavanelli also began doing triathlons, contests that include swimming, biking and running. She says she thought they would be a fun challenge.</p>
<p>Her first race, one day before her 40<sup>th</sup> birthday, was not auspicious. Zavanelli was kicked in the head during the first moments of the swim and proceeded to swallow huge gulps of seawater. She did the rest of the swim breast-stroking and coughing, then rode off on her commuter bike surrounded by racers on much sleeker equipment. She jogged through the run, thought about quitting but willed herself to finish and, a few days later, signed up for a triathlon training clinic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like challenges,&#8221; says Zavanelli. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never done anything that came easily for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zavanelli went on to enter 14 more Ironman-length triathlons, completing all but two.&#160; During one race she was pulled off when her heart started beating wildly and her blood pressure fell. The second time, a hip and knee injury caused her to miss the halfway cutoff point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always say, &#8220;I&#8217;m just too stubborn to quit,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>She also ran a number of marathons, including a 2011 half-marathon in Antarctica &#8212; a wild and chilly race tradition at the McMurdo Station, which was chronicled by the New York Times. She was fit and strong.</p>
<p>In 2013, however, Zavanelli began to notice something was wrong. While training for an Ironman triathlon in Idaho, she began tripping and then falling. She sought help and was diagnosed with advanced osteoporosis, then a lumbar spine compression &#8212; none of which were born out by subsequent tests. Finally, she was sent to Stanford where a neurologist told her she had a 50/50 chance of her symptoms being related to ALS.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was hoping for a brain tumor,&#8221; Zavanelli says with a quick smile.</p>
<p>At first, Zavanelli said she was angry at the diagnosis and then frustrated.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d see joggers and want to shout at them to enjoy every minute of their exercise. She&#8217;d see people smoking or eating junk food and get upset at how they were abusing their precious health.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to say, how could you do that to yourself? You could cut off my leg if that meant I could move again,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>She also grew tired of fighting her insurance company to get the equipment she needed as her strength failed.</p>
<p>But athletic training and what she calls her Midwestern sensibility took over. &#8220;I said, you can sit around being sad and angry or you can just get over yourself and do what you can,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to the conclusion that being angry and sad takes way more energy than being happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sitting in her sunny living room, Zavanelli said she is looking forward to returning to the classroom &#8220;as long as my voice holds out.&#8221; (One of ALS&#8217;s side effects is the loss of the ability to speak.) She also is part of an ALS research study into the relationship between gut biomes and neurological diseases. Not for herself but for those who may find themselves with the same diagnosis in the coming years, she says.</p>
<p>She spends her days watching television, reading emails, doing as much physical therapy as she can, and hanging out with her two dogs, a Samoyed and a husky named Karhu and Merlyn. Aides see to her needs. Her husband is Dan Costa, UC Santa Cruz professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve been fortunate in so many ways,&#8221; Zavanelli says after a quick phone conversation with a friend who plans a visit the next day. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done a lot in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s competed in athletic events on three continents, traveled around the world, done important research, met wonderful people, made close friends, and exposed thousands of students to the world of science.</p>
<p>&#160;"That&#8217;s why,&#8221; she says, &#8220;I can&#8217;t say &#8216;poor me.&#8217;&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="be861d7c8072701721067acf1a5802a1"><name>strome-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biologist Susan Strome to give annual Faculty Research Lecture</title><summary>Professor Strome will deliver the 50th annual UCSC Faculty Research Lecture on Friday, September 25.</summary><keywords>Susan Strome, Faculty Research Lecture, epigenetics, germ granules</keywords><start-date>1442214000000</start-date><display-name>Biologist Susan Strome to give annual Faculty Research Lecture</display-name><path>/2015/09/strome-lecture</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/09/strome-lecture</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1442010499313</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1446656629604</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/susan-strome-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/susan-strome-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>susan-strome-350.jpg</name><display-name>susan-strome-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>56724</file-size><width>350</width><height>347</height></image><image-alt>Susan Strome</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/susan-strome-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/susan-strome-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>susan-strome-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>susan-strome-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16428</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Susan Strome</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Susan Strome (Photo by C.

Entitled "Beyond the DNA Code: Transmission of developmental instructions from parents to offspring," the lecture is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>The annual Faculty Research Lecture is among the highest honors bestowed upon a faculty member by his or her own campus colleagues. It was given to Strome in recognition of her outstanding research accomplishments.</p>
<p>Strome studies germ cells, which are the progenitors of sperm and eggs and of future generations of organisms. A fundamental challenge in developmental biology has been the identification of mechanisms and genes that instruct a cell in the developing embryo to become a germ cell, as opposed to becoming a cell that contributes to the body of the organism. Throughout her career, Strome has studied how germ cells arise in the embryo and how they maintain their ability to self-renew. Using nematodes as a model organism, she has identified genes that determine whether a cell becomes a germ cell or a body cell.</p>
<p>Recent findings from Strome's lab have revealed crucial details of mechanisms called "epigenetics" by which a person's development may be influenced by the experiences of his or her parents and grandparents. Epigenetic modifications do not affect the DNA sequence of genes, but change how the DNA is packaged and how genes are expressed. In this way, epigenetic "memories" are transmitted from parents to their offspring. Because the factors that transmit and regulate this memory are the same in a wide range of animals, the Strome lab's findings in nematode worms have important implications for humans.</p>
<p>Another novel mode of developmental instruction discovered by Strome's lab is the role of "germ granules" in determining which cells develop as germ cells. Germ granules are distinctive structures found only in germ cells, and Strome's research team has shown that germ granules are delivered to the embryo by the egg and then passed specifically to germ cells to protect their germline fate.</p>
<p>A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Strome was appointed to a UC Santa Cruz Presidential Chair in July.

University Housing will open their doors for occupancy beginning Thursday, September 17, and student Move In will continue through Sunday, September 20.</p>
<p>This is an exciting period for our students and their families, and an excellent opportunity for us to welcome them to our University and community. However, residential Move In has impacts on campus parking and traffic and we ask for your patience and flexibility.</p>
<p>It is important to note the following restrictions and alternative parking options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most of the lots near colleges, and all three remote lots, will be restricted for Move In purposes on different days during Move In.</strong></li>
<li>On Thursday, close-in lots near Porter College will be restricted.</li>
<li>On Friday, close-in lots near Crown, Merrill, and Kresge will be restricted.</li>
</ul>
<p>For access during the weekend, please check the maps below for details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/Move-In-9-17-15.pdf">Restricted parking lot maps for Thursday 9/17</a></li>
<li><a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/Move-In-9-18-15.pdf">Restricted parking lot maps for Friday 9/18</a></li>
<li><a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/Move-In-9-19-15.pdf">Restricted parking lot maps for Saturday 9/19</a></li>
<li><a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/Move-In-9-20-15.pdf">Restricted parking lot maps for Sunday 9/20</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vehicles without a valid Move In permit will be cited if they park in restricted lots.</strong> (Vehicles with disability-related permits or placards are the exception to this rule.)</p>
<p><strong>Because of these restrictions, those with A, B, or R permits may need to find alternative parking.</strong> Please check the day-specific maps for non-restricted parking options listed above. Those with R permits will be able to park in <a href="http://basx2.ucsc.edu/104overflows.pdf">East Remote Overflow Lots 4 and 5</a> during Move In.</p>
<p><strong>From Thursday through Sunday, one-way traffic controls will be in place on Porter-Kresge Road.&#160;</strong>Traffic will only be allowed to go from Kresge to Porter; no traffic will be allowed to drive into the Porter entrance. Those needing to access Porter must enter through Kresge.</p>
<p><strong>From Thursday through Sunday, Hagar Drive will be closed to downhill traffic at Steinhart Way.</strong> Drivers are asked to use southbound Coolidge Drive (overlooking the Pogonip) to exit campus or access areas on Hagar south of the closure.</p>
<p>We anticipate thousands of additional vehicles on campus for the move-in period; this creates a significant challenge for the campus community, particularly on Thursday and Friday. Principal officers and managers are encouraged to consider alternative work sites for staff members at the discretion of the supervisor, if operationally feasible. We strongly encourage the use of alternative transportation options to get to campus (such as sharing a ride with a friend or colleague) to help accommodate the new student traffic.</p>
<p>Full move in details can be found at <a href="http://housing.ucsc.edu/move-in/">http://housing.ucsc.edu/move-in/</a>. If you have questions about the changes to parking and traffic flow, please contact Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) at 459-2190 or <a href="mailto:taps@ucsc.edu">taps@ucsc.edu</a>.

The collaboration provides the Genomics Institute with access to new compute, data storage, and analysis capabilities, enabling researchers to more easily collaborate and share information and speed scientific discovery.</p>
<p>"Genomics increasingly relies on large-scale computing, and this partnership enables us to do a lot of cloud-based computing for several major projects," said research scientist Benedict Paten, assistant director of the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/haussler-big-data.html">Center for Big Data in Translational Genomics</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The Azure platform will be used for a variety of genomics projects in which UCSC researchers are working to help the biomedical community use genomic information more effectively in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other diseases. These include the recently funded <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/childrens-cancer.html">California Kids Cancer Comparison</a>, which will use genomic analysis to help doctors identify effective treatments for California children with cancer who fail to respond to standard therapies; the Genomics Institute's participation in the <a href="https://icgc.org/">International Cancer Genome Consortium</a>, which is working to generate a comprehensive catalog of genomic abnormalities in 50 different tumor types and subtypes; and the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/07/keck-grant.html">Human Genome Variation Map</a> project to develop a comprehensive map of human genetic variation.</p>
<p>"The UCSC Genomics Institute is a premier genomics lab focused on driving targeted treatment of diseases," said Doug Burger, director of client and cloud applications at Microsoft Research. "Azure provides scale and efficiency to help institute researchers manage massive sets of genomics data while meeting stringent data use, security, and privacy requirements."</p>
<p>David Haussler, scientific director of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, said the partnership with Microsoft will accelerate progress on the institute's projects in cancer genomics and other areas. "Microsoft's resources can have a big impact in genomics," Haussler said. "They have the expertise in cloud computing, and we have the genomics expertise, so this partnership has great potential."</p>
<p>Cloud computing offers many advantages for genomics research projects that involve intensive computational analysis of large data sets. The flexibility of commercial cloud services means researchers have access to as much computing power as they need at any given time, so they can do their analyses more quickly, Paten said.</p>
<p>"It's more efficient to share compute resources than to own it ourselves," he said. "With the volume of genomic data increasing exponentially, it makes sense to use the scale of the commercial cloud."</p>
<p>In March 2015, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) lifted earlier restrictions on the use of cloud systems for storage and analysis of human genomic data, clearing the way for commercial providers of cloud services that meet NIH's data use and security standards to collaborate with the genomics research community.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/haussler-big-data.html</url><title>UC Santa Cruz leads $11 million Center for Big Data in Translational Genomics</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/childrens-cancer.html</url><title>California Initiative to Advance Precision Medicine funds UC Santa Cruz pediatric cancer project </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/07/keck-grant.html</url><title>Keck Foundation awards UC Santa Cruz $2 million for human genome variation project</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d1bfdfae8072701721067acfb82c0b39"><name>blake-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Oakes College founding provost to speak on his journey</title><summary>J.

Herman Blake, founding provost of Oakes College</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Beginnings and endings have been on the mind of J. Herman Blake.</p>
<p>There's his start at UC Santa Cruz in 1966 when he accepted an offer to join as a professor of sociology.</p>
<p>And when he was selected to serve as the founding provost for Oakes College, which opened in 1972.</p>
<p>And an ending, when he left the growing campus in 1984 to serve as the president of Tougaloo College.</p>
<p>Exploring the theme of beginnings and endings, Blake will deliver a talk, <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/3162">"My Unique Journey: Learning Never Ends,"</a> at 11 a.m. Sept. 26 outside the McHenry Library as part of Founders Celebration weekend. The event, sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Library, is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Blake said he hopes to pay tribute to the great work of founding Chancellor Dean McHenry, and many others.</p>
<p>A 1962 Time magazine <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/press-photos/index.html">publicity shot</a> of Dean McHenry has him sitting at a desk adorned with books and a photo with a sweeping view of the Monterey Bay. Blake said the image has been on his mind as he thinks about his talk.</p>
<p>"It's a concept that the sky is the limit," Blake said. "That image says 'the world is yours, make it a good world.'" "I now realize how much that photo of Dean McHenry and the inspiration I received from so many others led me to my own philosophy of education and learning-which reflects that photo."</p>
<p>Blake recounts his time at UC Santa Cruz and his life after leaving the campus in <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/blake">"Look'n M' Face and Hear M' Story,"</a> an oral history published last year by the library.</p>
<p>"I kept thinking about my experiences as an undergraduate: open, receptive teachers who took me and molded and motivated me," Blake said. "That's what I wanted to do. And Santa Cruz was developing that way."</p>
<p>While at Santa Cruz he also developed a program that linked the university to Gullah Geechee communities in South Carolina. UC Santa Cruz students lived and served in those communities, and ultimately three students from South Carolina enrolled at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Now in South Carolina, Blake serves as the executive director for the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Commission where he continues to emphasize his educational perspectives.<br/>
 The corridor was created by Congress in 2006 to recognize the important contributions made to American culture and history by the Gullah Geechee: African Americans who settled in the coastal counties of South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, and Florida.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night on June 17, Blake awoke to news about the shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston. The church was where Blake and his wife would go to worship around Christmas, and where he laid his uncle to rest.</p>
<p>Feeling tremendously touched and upset, Blake wrote a lament that was issued by the commission the next morning:</p>
<p><em>In the completely black darkness of the night and early morning, in the deep recesses of moss-laden oak trees, ponds and lagoons where our ancestors toiled for generations, we drop down-our knees to the cold floor-and we seek understanding, we seek solace, we seek a way out of this "no-way".</em></p>
<p><em>Our sobbing voices utter unspoken prayers as we gather in supplication to the spirits that have brought us this far by faith.</em></p>
<p><em>Our hearts are broken, but we know comfort is there. Our spirits are strong because we know guidance is there.</em></p>
<p><em>Our faith is triumphant because we know our beloved community is here.</em></p>
<p><em>"Knee-bone, knee-bone, knee-bone, Oh my Lord."</em></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d2b31a1e8072701721067acf1ebec6df"><name>diversity-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz receives higher education diversity award</title><summary>Many campus constituents provided information about amazing programs and projects that advance diversity and inclusion for faculty, staff, and students and to prospective students in K-12.</summary><start-date>1442347200000</start-date><display-name>Diversity award</display-name><path>/2015/09/diversity-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/09/diversity-award</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1442348997112</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1442425762091</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/heed-award.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/heed-award.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>heed-award.jpg</name><display-name>heed-award.jpg</display-name><file-size>26901</file-size><width>300</width><height>214</height></image><image-alt>Diversity award </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/diversity-award-80px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/diversity-award-80px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>diversity-award-80px.jpeg</name><display-name>diversity-award-80px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>23263</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/marlowe-sheree-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/marlowe-sheree-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>marlowe-sheree-400.jpg</name><display-name>marlowe-sheree-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>51053</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>Sheree M.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has received the 2015 Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) Award from INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine, the oldest and largest diversity-focused publication in higher education.</p>
<p>Sheree M. Marlowe, campus diversity officer for staff and students, said the award is an honor and the result of a collaborative campus process.</p>
<p>Many campus constituents provided information about amazing programs and projects that advance diversity and inclusion for faculty, staff, and students and to prospective students in K-12.</p>
<p>"When drafting this award, I was amazed at the great people, units and programs we have on our campus from outreach efforts in admissions, student-initiated outreach, our resource centers, diversity in STEM programs, the black experience team, a mentoring program for faculty, our diversity and inclusion certificate program, and more," Marlowe said. "I'm proud to be at UCSC and look forward to continuing the work to advance diversity and promote a healthy campus climate."</p>
<p>As a recipient of the annual HEED Award - a national honor recognizing U.S. colleges and universities that demonstrate an outstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion - UC Santa Cruz will be featured, along with 91 other recipients, in the November 2015 issue of INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine.</p>
<p>"The HEED Award process consists of a comprehensive and rigorous application that includes questions relating to the recruitment and retention of students and employees - and best practices for both - continued leadership support for diversity, and other aspects of campus diversity and inclusion," said Lenore Pearlstein, publisher of INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine. "We take a holistic approach to reviewing each application in deciding who will be named a HEED Award recipient. Our standards are high, and we look for institutions where diversity and inclusion are woven into the work being accomplished every day across a campus,"</p>
<p>UCLA, UCSF and UC Santa Barbara were also given a HEED award.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d8357dc98072701721067acf2b85499e"><name>farm-to-fork</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Paying it forward: annual Farm to Fork event honors past and future farmers</title><summary>The Farm to Fork dinner series has supported more than 150 apprentices through scholarships and subsidized meal plans.</summary><keywords>farm to fork, farming, casfs, agroecology</keywords><start-date>1442430000000</start-date><display-name>Farm to Fork</display-name><path>/2015/09/farm-to-fork</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/09/farm-to-fork</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1442441428373</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1442937011606</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdewitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/ogorman-raiford-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/ogorman-raiford-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ogorman-raiford-500px.jpg</name><display-name>ogorman-raiford-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>60932</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Matthew Raiford and Michael O'Gorman</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/farm-tour-80px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/farm-tour-80px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>farm-tour-80px.jpeg</name><display-name>farm-tour-80px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>9232</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>The UCSC farm</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Matthew Raiford, right, and Michael O'Gorman at Farm to Fork.

<p>Since then, the Farm to Fork dinner series has supported more than 150 apprentices through scholarships and subsidized meal plans. When the next class of apprentices arrives in spring 2016, the event will have helped almost 200.</p>
<p>"It's about paying it forward," said Raiford to guests, who included current and former apprentices as well as Alec and Claudia Webster, whose generous donation kickstarted the renovation for the newly restored historic Cowell Ranch Hay Barn where Saturday's dinner was held.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal also attended, remarking that "UCSC has a long tradition of being a place where visionaries can make their mark. ... That has certainly happened here."</p>
<p><strong>Veteran to Chef to Farmer</strong></p>
<p>When Matthew Raiford visited the campus farm as a student from the Culinary Institute of America in 2005, he had no idea he would return six years later as an apprentice. He certainly did not anticipate that one day he would help make it possible for hundreds of future apprentices to attend the program.</p>
<p>Raiford came to CASFS after he and his sister Althea inherited Gilliard Farms, their family farm in Brunswick, Ga. The land had been in the family since 1874 and had ties to post-Civil War legislation that helped African Americans receive property rights. To the Raifords, the farm is an important historic and family legacy.</p>
<p>But neither sibling had any experience farming. The farm was inactive. At the time, Raiford was a successful chef in Washington, D.C., and catered at the House of Representatives. Before that, Raiford served nine years in the U.S. Army. Althea had just retired from a 20-year service in the Navy and was about to pursue a master's degree.</p>
<p>They did realize one thing: "One of us had to learn farming," said Raiford.</p>
<p>As veterans, Matthew and Althea sought counsel through the Farmer Veteran Coalition (FVC). Michael O'Gorman, FVC founder whose organization had origins in Santa Cruz, encouraged Matthew to apply to CASFS to learn organic farming. The FVC offered Raiford a scholarship to attend the competitive training program in ecological horticulture.</p>
<p><strong>Paying it forward</strong></p>
<p>"I owe a lot of where I am right now thanks to the FVC," said Raiford about the scholarship that enabled a life-changing experience for him at CASFS.</p>
<p>Raiford shared how field production manager Liz Milazzo stressed how you can only do so much until you cannot do it well. Apprenticeship coordinator, Diane Nichols, christened Raiford as the "CheFarmer," his now infamous title that recognizes his culinary and agricultural talents. Farm manager Orin Martin taught him everything about composting, which was the first task Raiford took on when he returned to his farm ("I make compost more than I farm," joked Raiford).</p>
<p>To Raiford, the scholarship also marked the first movement in paying it forward. He wanted to make sure the next generation of farmers could benefit from the same lessons he learned.</p>
<p>So Farm to Fork was born.</p>
<p>"You are lending a hand to someone else," said Raiford about the event's theme which centers on making it better for the following cohort of apprentices.</p>
<p>Raiford continues to pay it forward. He recruited two apprentices from the 2015 class for an advanced internship to learn site and field management at Gilliard Farms.</p>
<p>"It's come full circle," said Raiford. "Keep it going. Never let that stop."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dd3414588072701721067acf269f6354"><name>replacing-water-valve</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>City replacing water main valve</title><summary>The City of Santa Cruz Water Department is planning to replace a water main valve, a major project that will begin on Tuesday, September 22. </summary><start-date>1442300400000</start-date><display-name>City replacing water main valve</display-name><path>/2015/09/replacing-water-valve</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/09/replacing-water-valve</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1442525221943</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1442525345481</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>The City of Santa Cruz Water Department is planning to replace a water main valve, a major project that will begin on Tuesday, September 22.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The work is estimated to take 16 hours. During this time we will be relying on water held in storage tanks to meet demand.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We ask the campus population to be especially diligent with water use during this city project. Campus operations will minimize our irrigation to conserve water while city crews are replacing the valve.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We don&#8217;t expect to notice any campus impacts. While it is expected that the shutdown will last only the estimated time, or less, it could go longer if something unexpected occurs. I will provide an update if there are unexpected delays in the project.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I appreciate your patience and help in making this a successful operation for the city.&#160;</div>

partner David Rawlings took home a Lifetime Achievement Award in Songwriting at the <strong>2015 Americana Music Awards</strong> Sept. 16.</p>
<p>Held at the historic Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, they were honored alongside fellow lifetime achievers Ricky Skaggs, Don Henley, Buffy Sainte-Marie, and Los Lobos. Each of the honorees performed during the three-hour celebration.</p>
<p>The performances will air later this year on the PBS concert series, <em>Austin City Limits</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;These artists have not only influenced the Americana community, but the musical landscape on the whole,&#8221; said Jed Hilly, executive director of the AMA. &#8220;They all have been an inspiration to our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Welch graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1990 with an art degree. As an undergraduate, her senior work was in photography.</p>
<p><strong>Throughout a two-decade long</strong> creative partnership, Welch and Rawlings have mostly recorded and performed under the name &#8220;Gillian Welch.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>But tomorrow, the American roots duo will release their seventh studio album together and their second as the &#8220;Dave Rawlings Machine,&#8221; with Rawlings handling the lead-singing role.</p>
<p>The new album is titled <em>Nashville Obsolete</em>. Recorded on analog tape at Woodland Sound Studios in Nashville, it features seven original compositions written by Welch and Rawlings.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to the kind of 1930s/Depression/Dust Bowl thing we&#8217;ve always had going on, there&#8217;s a pretty strong 1970s thing going on, too,&#8221; says Welch.</p>
<p>The duo&#8217;s previous album, the Gillian Welch release <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/07/gillian-welch.html"><em><strong>The Harrow and the Harvest,</strong></em></a> was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2011.</p>
<p>Before they embark on a world tour to support the new release, Welch and Rawlings will make a handful of appearances as Gillian Welch--including the closing slot at the inaugural AmericanaFest concert at the new Ascend Amphitheater in downtown Nashville. That show will also feature Loretta Lynn and Steve Earle.</p>
<p>Welch will also perform in Monterey at the <a href="http://www.goldenstatetheatre.com"><em><strong>Golden State Theater</strong></em></a> on Friday, October 2. Don&#8217;t miss it.</p>

Group</article-subhead><article-text><p>The Santa Cruz Cancer Benefit Group (SCCBG), a local charity supporting cancer research and patient care, has awarded grants of $12,500 each to four researchers at UC Santa Cruz: <strong>Scott Lokey</strong>, professor of chemistry and biochemistry; <strong>Jevgenij Raskatov</strong>, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry; <strong>Seth Rubin</strong>, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry; and <strong>Zhu Wang</strong>, assistant professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology.</p>
<p>In the past, pilot projects funded by these small grants from SCCBG have enabled UCSC faculty to obtain preliminary results that led to much larger grants from the National Institutes of Health and other funding agencies.&#160;</p>
<p>Lokey, who directs the UCSC Chemical Screening Center, will use the grant to search for compounds that could improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy drugs. He plans to run a pilot-scale screen of 23,000 compounds housed in the Chemical Screening Center.</p>
<p>Raskatov is interested in the role of inflammation in cancer. He will use SCCBG funds to start a new research project focused on developing inhibitors of a pro-inflammatory signaling process thought to be involved in carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Rubin's lab has made important findings regarding a key tumor suppressor protein and is starting a new project focused on another regulatory molecule involved in cancer, the FoxM1 transcription factor. Understanding how FoxM1 is activated will aid in the development of potential cancer therapeutics.</p>
<p>Wang has been investigating the mechanisms of prostate cancer initiation and is expanding his research into bladder cancer, which has not been well studied despite being a major cause of cancer-related deaths and one of the most costly cancers to treat. He plans to use novel gene editing technologies to build a new model of bladder cancer in mice.</p>
<p>The SCCBG has been supporting cancer research at UC Santa Cruz since 2005. The group holds several annual events to raise funds for the programs it supports. More information is available on the <a href="http://www.sccbg.org/">SCCBG web site</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e24e7a758072701721067acffb03c501"><name>staff-mentor-program-extended</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff Mentorship Program applications deadline extended </title><summary>The application for the Staff Mentorship Program has been extended to Wednesday, September 30.

Arboretum will hold its annual Fall Plant Sale on Saturday, October 10, from noon to 4 p.m. at the Eucalyptus Grove on High Street near the intersection of Western Drive. Held in conjunction with the California Native Plant Society, the sale opens early (from 10 a.m. to noon) for members of either organization. Memberships will be on sale at the gate.</p>
<p>Fall is a great time to get new plantings established in the garden. The days are getting shorter, soil and air temperatures begin to cool down, and the rainy season is about to begin. At this year's Fall Plant Sale, the Scotts Valley and Santa Cruz Water Districts will be providing information on how to get rebates for replacing lawns with drought-tolerant landscaping. Ecology Action will also have a table at the event.</p>
<p>The sale will feature drought-tolerant and unusual plants from California, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Plants from the Arboretum's renowned collections have been grown for the sale, and many of them may not be readily available in nurseries. Knowledgeable Arboretum staff and volunteers will be on hand to provide information and answer questions.</p>
<p>Among the highlights of this year's sale is the Island Bush Poppy <em>(Dendromecon hardfordii)</em>, a large, open evergreen shrub native to the Channel Islands. It is drought tolerant, grows ten or more feet tall and wide, and has large, bright yellow, saucer-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>A large selection of Australian Banksias will be available, including <em>Banksia baueri</em> (a.k.a. 'Teddy Bear Banksia'), with large ten- by six-inch cylindrical flower heads, and <em>Banksia grandis</em>, a small specimen tree with large, bright yellow candle flowers. Other featured plants include <em>Tetratheca</em> 'Amethyst Eyes,' <em>Pultenaea villosa</em> 'Butterscotch,' <em>Leucospermum</em> 'Firewheel,' and <em>Leucadendron</em> 'Safari Goldstrike.'</p>
<p>An extensive list of plants being offered for sale will be available after October 1 on the Arboretum's <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">web site</a>. Plant sales and memberships benefit the Arboretum's conservation and education programs.</p>
<p>For more information about the sale, contact the UCSC Arboretum at (831) 427-2998 or visit the Arboretum's <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">web site</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/UCSCArboretum">Facebook page</a>.

<p>What he found inside were 260 scruffy but idealistic students &#8212; most of them long-haired, many with dogs. Griggs, who had finished his Ph.D. in three years and never taught before, stepped up and began his oceanography lecture. When he was finished, the entire room stood and applauded.</p>
<p>Almost five decades later, Griggs, now director of the Institute of Marine Sciences, has shed the coat and tie in favor of jeans and a button-down shirt. But at 71, Griggs is still youthful-looking and still at work.</p>
<p>This will be his 48<sup>th</sup> year teaching oceanography and 40<sup>th</sup> year teaching coastal geology: 14,000 students and 72 grad students by his count.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is amazing now is to think back about those first few years of flower children and realize that they are now 60-65 years old and have careers and families," Griggs says. "In some cases, they've already retired, but I can&#8217;t find any reason to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Griggs is one of 18 pioneer faculty who came to UC Santa Cruz before 1970 and who are still actively involved in the campus. They continue to work, they say, because they love opening students&#8217; eyes to the world around them, because they are excited by discovery, and because they believe being a professor is one of the best jobs around.</p>
<p>&#8220;A businessman can come home and say I made a million dollars today,&#8221; says G. William Domhoff, emeritus professor of psychology and sociology who has been teaching at UC Santa Cruz for 50 years. &#8221;For me, the gratification is when a student comes up to me and says, &#8216;I think I learned something today.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<h3>Harry Noller: The excitement of the lab</h3>
<p>Stand under the redwoods outside the Sinsheimer Labs building most mornings and you will see bushy-haired Emeritus Professor of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology Harry Noller heading to work.</p>
<p>At 76, Noller has retired from teaching, but the excitement of what is happening in his lab draws him like a thirsty man to water.</p>
<p>Noller, who came to UC Santa Cruz in 1968, is a decorated scientist who studies the ribosome, a kind of bilingual molecule that bridges the gap between DNA and RNA on one hand and proteins on the other. It is one of the core mysteries of science and is essential to all forms of life. Over the years, Noller&#8217;s research has turned the understanding of the mysterious ribosome on its head.</p>
<p>He discovered that the RNA component carries out key functions of the ribosome &#8212; the inverse of what most scientists believed. He has done atomic-level mapping of the structure of the ribosome, a basis for the development of targeted antibiotics. Now, he is piecing together the actual movements of the ribosome as it does its job.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing is alive as you look at it,&#8221; Noller says, enthusiasm seeping into his words. &#8220;It is flexing and reaching to grab things and pulling them through at the atomic level.&#160; This is the basis of life. This is how the genetic code is read in all of our cells every minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what excites me,&#8221; Noller says. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I go to work every day.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Adrienne Zihlman: The exhilaration of discovery</h3>
<p>It is that same sense of excitement that keeps Professor of Anthropology Adrienne Zihlman on the job, three years after her supposed retirement.</p>
<p>Zihlman, 74, first shook up the field of anthropology with research that showed female gathering activities could just as easily account for our big brains as men&#8217;s hunting behaviors did. Then, at a time when the common chimpanzee was considered the model for the human-ape ancestor, she proposed that the rare pygmy chimpanzee was a better model in its anatomy and behavior.</p>
<p>While both these ideas were met with strong opposition at first, more evidence has made them generally accepted in academia today.</p>
<p>Now, Zihlman is pulling together decades of that research into a beautifully illustrated text &#8212; a kind of &#8220;Gray&#8217;s Anatomy&#8221; for apes.</p>
<p>Working with illustrator and former UC Santa Cruz student Carol Underwood, Zihlman&#8217;s tome will tell an evolutionary and anatomical tale designed for both scientists and lay people.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the exhilaration of discovery, of shining a light on apes and evolution, that keeps Zihlman working.</p>
<p>Quoting Freud that &#8220;anatomy is destiny,&#8221; Zihlman added, &#8220;It&#8217;s also the key to the mystery of human evolution.&#8221;</p>
<h3>David Kaun: The joy and pleasure of teaching</h3>
<p>At 83, Emeritus Professor of Economics David Kaun is quick to laugh about why he will soon embark on his 50<sup>th</sup> year of teaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a labor economist,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I spent my entire career trying to figure out why people work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kaun came to the campus in 1966 from a teaching job at the University of Pittsburgh, drawn by the beautiful setting and the offbeat experiment that was UC Santa Cruz. Like Griggs&#8217;s students, Kaun would usually bring his dog, a long-legged basset hound named Greta, to class.</p>
<p>But long after most retirees are lounging on cruise ships and driving across the country in motor homes, Kaun will be teaching two classes this year: one on the Political Economy of Capitalism and the other on the Economics of the Arts, a course born out of his love for music and his talent on the clarinet.</p>
<p>Kaun will also lead his popular Labor Wars in Theory and Film class, which leaves most of its students saying they can never quite watch a movie the same way again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been extremely fortunate, blessed, and lucky to wind up doing something that has been such a joy and pleasure,&#8221; says Kaun of his work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides, if you spend your life around 20-year-olds,&#8221; he says, &#8220;how can you possibly get old?&#8221;</p>
<h3>G. William Domhoff: Explaining concepts leads to deeper insights</h3>
<p>Psychology professor Domhoff feels much the same way.</p>
<p>Twenty-one years after his alleged retirement, the 79-year-old academic most known for his study of dreams and his work on the psychology of power, says student inquiries and the need to explain concepts in his field often bring new insights.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a dialogue with students, trying to explain something, makes you understand the subject better,&#8221; Domhoff says, &#8220;and that really matters to me."</p>
<p>It&#8217;s part of the reason, besides being a member of an academic community, that Domhoff will teach two courses this year. He is also continuing work on a book that presents his theory of dreams as &#8220;a form of intensified mind-wandering that dramatizes an individual&#8217;s main, personal concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>As one of only two working professors who began teaching the same year UC Santa Cruz was born &#8212; Emeritus Professor of Literature Harry Berger will teach a course on Plato in the spring &#8212; Domhoff finds satisfaction in his profession.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same gratification that became clear to Griggs when he learned that one of his students, a former language major named Kathryn Sullivan, credited part of her success to him.</p>
<p>Inspired by his oceanography course and Griggs&#8217;s answers to her many questions, she got her Ph.D. in that subject, went on to become the first American woman to walk in space, and is now undersecretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p>Sullivan will be master of ceremonies at UC Santa Cruz's <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/founders/index.html">Founders Celebration Fiat Fifty</a> dinner on September 26.</p>
<p>&#8220;It made &#8230; me appreciate how critically important our roles are at UCSC, or any university,&#8221; Griggs says. &#8220;It has been the rewards and satisfaction of events like this, and others, that continue to inspire and motivate me.&#8221;</p>

The system uses direct optical detection of viral molecules and can be integrated into a simple, portable instrument for use in field situations where rapid, accurate detection of Ebola infections is needed to control outbreaks.</p>
<p>Laboratory tests using preparations of Ebola virus and other hemorrhagic fever viruses showed that the system has the sensitivity and specificity needed to provide a viable clinical assay. The team reported their results in a paper published September 25 in <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14494"><em>Nature Scientific Reports</em></a>.</p>
<p>An outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa has killed more than 11,000 people since 2014, with new cases occurring recently in Guinea and Sierra Leone. The current gold standard for Ebola virus detection relies on a method called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the virus's genetic material for detection. Because PCR works on DNA molecules and Ebola is an RNA virus, the reverse transcriptase enzyme is used to make DNA copies of the viral RNA prior to PCR amplification and detection.<br/>
<br/>
 "Compared to our system, PCR detection is more complex and requires a laboratory setting," said senior author Holger Schmidt, the Kapany Professor of Optoelectronics at UC Santa Cruz. "We're detecting the nucleic acids directly, and we achieve a comparable limit of detection to PCR and excellent specificity."</p>
<p><strong>Sensitivity and specificity</strong></p>
<p>In laboratory tests, the system provided sensitive detection of Ebola virus while giving no positive counts in tests with two related viruses, Sudan virus and Marburg virus. Testing with different concentrations of Ebola virus demonstrated accurate quantification of the virus over six orders of magnitude. Adding a "preconcentration" step during sample processing on the microfluidic chip extended the limit of detection well beyond that achieved by other chip-based approaches, covering a range comparable to PCR analysis.</p>
<p>"The measurements were taken at clinical concentrations covering the entire range of what would be seen in an infected person," Schmidt said.</p>
<p>Schmidt's lab at UC Santa Cruz worked with researchers at Brigham Young University and UC Berkeley to develop the system. Virologists at Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio prepared the viral samples for testing.</p>
<p>The system combines two small chips, a microfluidic chip for sample preparation and an optofluidic chip for optical detection. For over a decade, Schmidt and his collaborators have been developing optofluidic chip technology for optical analysis of single molecules as they pass through a tiny fluid-filled channel on the chip. The microfluidic chip for sample processing can be integrated as a second layer next to or on top of the optofluidic chip.</p>
<p><strong>Sample preparation</strong></p>
<p>Schmidt's lab designed and built the microfluidic chip in collaboration with coauthor Richard Mathies at UC Berkeley who pioneered this technology. It is made of a silicon-based polymer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and has microvalves and fluidic channels to transport the sample between nodes for various sample preparation steps. The targeted molecules--in this case, Ebola virus RNA--are isolated by binding to a matching sequence of synthetic DNA (called an oligonucleotide) attached to magnetic microbeads. The microbeads are collected with a magnet, nontarget biomolecules are washed off, and the bound targets are then released by heating, labeled with fluorescent markers, and transferred to the optofluidic chip for optical detection.</p>
<p>Schmidt noted that the team has not yet been able to test the system starting with raw blood samples. That will require additional sample preparation steps, and it will also have to be done in a biosafety level 4 facility.<br/>
<br/>
 "We are now building a prototype to bring to the Texas facility so that we can start with a blood sample and do a complete front-to-back analysis," Schmidt said. "We are also working to use the same system for detecting less dangerous pathogens and do the complete analysis here at UC Santa Cruz."</p>
<p>The lead authors of the paper are postdoctoral researcher Hong Cai and graduate student Joshua Parks, both in Schmidt's lab at UC Santa Cruz. A team led by Aaron Hawkins at BYU fabricated the silicon-based optofluidic chips. Virologist Jean Patterson led the team at Texas Biomedical Research Institute that prepared viral samples for testing. This research was supported by the W. M. Keck Center for Nanoscale Optofluidics at UC Santa Cruz and grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/08/nanopore-optofluidics.html</url><title>Novel chip-based platform could simplify measurements of single molecules</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/03/innovation-corps.html</url><title>Researchers win grant to explore commercial potential of sensor technology </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fca4cb538072701721067acf53c8252a"><name>cinema-society-series</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Wednesday Night Cinema Society kicks off new film series curated by grad students</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz weekly film series, Wednesday Night Cinema Society, is back this year, with films specially curated by grad students.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, ucsc film and digital media, ucsc film series, ucsc news, uc santa cruz news</keywords><start-date>1443054000000</start-date><display-name>Wednesday Night Cinema Society kicks off new film series </display-name><path>/2015/09/cinema-society-series</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/09/cinema-society-series</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1443052702505</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1443117883106</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/cinema-series-poster-375.png</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/cinema-series-poster-375.png</link><site>news</site><name>cinema-series-poster-375.png</name><display-name>cinema-series-poster-375.png</display-name><file-size>123134</file-size><width>375</width><height>301</height></image><image-alt>cinema series poster</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/cinema-society-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/cinema-society-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cinema-society-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cinema-society-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23021</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>film poster</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/berlin-harlem-poster-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/berlin-harlem-poster-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>berlin-harlem-poster-300.jpg</name><display-name>berlin-harlem-poster-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>85501</file-size><width>300</width><height>353</height></image><image-alt>film poster</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz weekly film series, <strong>Wednesday Night Cinema Society</strong>, is back this year, with films specially curated by grad students.<br/>
<br/>
 The theme of the Fall 2015 series is <em>Transgressive Cross-Currents in Film Programming: West Berlin and NYC, 1968-1989</em>, curated by Marc Francis, a Ph.D. student in Film and Digital Media.<br/>
<br/>
 "As the first guest programmer, I will be exhibiting films based on my summer research in New York City and Berlin, where I unearthed programming calendars and schedules to see what films took art-house audiences by storm during this pivotal period of changing sexual and gender politics,"&#160;said Francis.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I was interested in what kinds of art-house films were often repeatedly screened in two of the most vanguard artistic meccas of the 20th Century: West Berlin and New York City,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
 <em>Wednesday Night Cinema Society</em> was created by UC Santa Cruz film &amp; digital media associate professors Irene Lusztig and Irene Gustafson in 2009.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;We started it in homage to the types of 16mm cinema clubs and film societies that used to thrive on college campuses before the age of home video,&#8221; said Lusztig, and &#8220;also to address what felt like a lack of informal, communal gathering spaces on campus to watch non-mainstream, experimental, innovative, hard-to-find, and challenging cinema.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;The idea of making a regular space outside of the classroom to get together and watch things on a big screen felt important and very much needed--for our students, who live in a small city without active alternative screening spaces--and also for ourselves as faculty,&#8221; she added.<br/>
<br/>
 Lusztig noted that faculty have been showing work regularly on Wednesday nights since the series started, but this is the first year that they are changing the format to invite Ph.D. student guest curators to program each quarter.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;It&#8217;s a way for them to think about placing their research questions into a curatorial context,&#8221; said Lusztig, who was recently honored with an Excellence in Teaching Award from the UC Santa Cruz Academic Senate. &#8220;I hope we are able to continue this format with grad students in future years.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>In Winter quarter,</strong> the series will present works which deal with the urban landscape--exploring themes related to urban spaces, human geography, gentrification and processes of change, and the role of nostalgia in response to that change.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;During this quarter, we plan to bring Jenni Olson, an award-winning San Francisco-based filmmaker to present and discuss her most recent film <em>The Royal Road</em>,&#8221; said graduate student Christina Corfield, who will be curating the Spring series.<br/>
<br/>
 Corfield noted that the winter programming will draw from grad student curator Samuael Topiary&#8217;s academic work on urban and environmental gentrification, urban farming, and collective methods of urban planning and design.<br/>
<br/>
 Spring quarter will explore the rural landscape&#8212;focusing on the pastoral, nature, the travelogue form, and the effects of industry on myths of the American West. This series draws from Corfield&#8217;s own research into representations of the American West, and American history.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8221;During this series, two West Coast artists will visit whose works deal specifically with these themes,&#8221; said Corfield. &#8220;Matt McCormick, based in Portland, Oregon, produces travelogue films including <em>The Great Northwest</em> which deals with the changing industrial landscape of the Pacific Northwest and the death of road trip culture.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Lee Ann Schmidt is a Los Angeles based filmmaker, whose work <em>The Last Buffalo Hunt</em> deals with one of the last open landscapes in America, even while depicting it's demise,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>The new hires help to build campus strengths in many key areas across the divisions.</p>
<p>One of those professors is <a href="http://www.hillaryangelo.com">Hillary Angelo</a>, an urban and environmental sociologist who earned her Ph.D. from New York University. She was drawn to the campus and the department by the commitment to using research and teaching to inform activism and public policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;This department is extremely focused on the world as it is and the world as it could be,&#8221; Angelo said.</p>
<p>Her dissertation looked at the urban greening of Germany&#8217;s Ruhr Valley over the course of a century. She&#8217;s now starting projects on equity and urban sustainability planning with a focus on New York and California, in collaboration with Miriam Greenberg, another faculty member in the Sociology Department.</p>
<p>When people talk about sustainability, she said, it&#8217;s usually defined in terms of three areas: economy, ecology and equity. Planners can accomplish two of the three, with equity often getting left behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think planners are trying to bring equity back,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re asking, What does it look like? Is it through affordable housing? Participation in planning? Culturally open-ended public space? How is equity defined?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before enrolling in graduate school, Angelo spent five years working for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, primarily on issues of participatory design, immigration, and public space use.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.katherineinterface.com">Katherine Isbister</a><a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/kisbister"></a> came to UC Santa Cruz to join some of the world&#8217;s top game engineering researchers working in the Baskin School of Engineering's Computational Media Department.</p>
<p>Her research is at the intersection of human-computer interaction and games. She&#8217;s interested in how design choices and technological innovations impact how people feel and interact with each other, when they play games and engage other highly interactive systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve dived deep into topics including games and emotion, character design for games, movement-based games, and how to best do game user research,&#8221; Isbister said. &#8220;More recently, I&#8217;ve also gotten interested in how to apply what we know about the deep engagement and pleasures of games to designing technologies for everyday wellbeing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isbister first discovered the power of games after the zoo where she worked after college installed an interactive kiosk.</p>
<p>She wasn&#8217;t much of a bird fan, ignoring the birdhouse as she walked to her office, but the kiosk let the user try out being a redwing blackbird that needs to build a nest, attract a mate and find food.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realized after playing that game, that I had more empathy for birds after 20 minutes than I&#8217;d had from seeing them every day for more than a year,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It gave me the feeling that this medium had some peculiar and unique strengths that I wanted to study and understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>"I always dreamed of this day, but experiencing it is something else," the first-year student said as his parents walked behind him with suitcases filled with clothes to his Oakes College room.</p>
<p>Lopez is one of approximately 3,600 freshmen who are part of the 51st class at UC Santa Cruz. Like 43 percent of this class, he will be the first in his family to earn a college degree.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is also welcoming about 1,150 transfer students. The Division of Graduate Studies estimates there are about 550 new students pursuing their Ph.D. or master's degrees.</p>
<p>This academic year, UC Santa Cruz will have <a href="new-faculty.xml">35 new senate faculty members</a>, bringing the campus total up to 568.</p>
<p>Instruction for the fall quarter begins today and welcome events continue for students as they begin their college career.</p>
<p>"We are very pleased to see an increase in the number of transfer students, predominantly from California Community Colleges, especially given the increased number of majors requiring students complete the major preparation coursework," said Associate Vice Chancellor for Enrollment Management Michelle Whittingham.</p>
<p>The 51st class is distinguished by academic achievement and diversity. GPAs and SATs have increased from Fall 2014 to Fall 2015. The average GPA for incoming freshmen is 3.76, up from 3.68 and the average SAT score is 1,745, up from 1,684.</p>
<p>More than 3,200 of the new freshmen are from California. Additionally, 250 will come from 22 countries, and 195 from 40 states.</p>
<p>Nearly a third of both the 2015 freshman class (31 percent) and transfer class (33 percent) are comprised of students from ethnic backgrounds that have been traditionally underrepresented within the UC system - African-American/Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Hispanic.</p>
<p>This fall's freshman class includes 27 percent from Hispanic or Latino backgrounds, 37 percent Asian American, 30 percent white/Caucasian, 3 percent African American/Black, 1 percent American Indian/Alaskan Native and 1.7 percent unknown.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is a Hispanic Serving Institution member of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, with 30 percent of undergraduates identifying as Hispanic or Latino, well above the required 25 percent to qualify.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is also dedicated to helping students pay for college. In 2014-15, 82 percent of undergraduate students received a $290 million in financial aid or campus employment. Additionally, 92 percent of UC Santa Cruz graduate students received $56 million in aid or employment.</p>
<p>Students moved back last week and have been busy learning about the campus. This year the campus will be housing 9,032 students on campus, up from 8,637 in fall 2014. The number of beds has increased because of completed maintenance and repair work to the exteriors and interiors at Cowell College and Porter College apartment complexes.</p>
<p>"It is particularly extraordinary to see these incredible new students and our returning students as we celebrate our 1965 founding this weekend," Whittingham said. "I look at the sense of inquiry and abilities each student brings with them and wonder who will return in the next several decades - or even to celebrate the centennial - to share their accomplishments, contributions and new discoveries, ultimately making a difference locally and globally like so many of our alumni."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2015/09/storycruz-colemans</path><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value><value>StoryCruz</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2015/09/storycruz-colemans</link><site>news</site><name>storycruz-colemans</name><display-name>StoryCruz: Bittersweet moment</display-name><title>StoryCruz: Bittersweet moment</title><summary>In our new audio stories project, Charles and Adrienne Coleman of Greenville, S.C., share their bittersweet feelings about dropping their son, Vernon, off for his freshman year at UC Santa Cruz.&#13;

Corday Family Presidential Chair in Writing for Television &amp; Film.</strong></p>
<p>The new chair will provide permanent support for students and faculty in the Film and Digital Media Department. This gift will significantly strengthen the department&#8217;s screenwriting program for film and television and enable students to learn directly from guest lecturers and experts in the field.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the game changer for our students interested in writing for film and television,&#8221; said David Yager, dean of the Arts Division. &#8220;The wonderful thing about an endowment is that it establishes an opportunity for our students in perpetuity that otherwise would not be possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>"It is incredibly generous to have someone think about the arts at UC Santa Cruz, and truly understand how important this gift is for our students and their education,&#8221; Yager added.&#160;&#8220;We are extremely grateful for, and excited about how this will change our program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corday graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a Bachelor of Arts in Music/Aesthetic Studies in 1975 and a Master&#8217;s degree in Music Composition in 1977. He is an Emmy Award-winning producer, best known for the daytime soap opera <em>Days of Our Lives</em>, which is now celebrating its 50<sup>th</sup> year.</p>
<p><em>Days of Our Lives</em> has won numerous Emmys over the years and has most recently been awarded the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series in 2013 and 2015. <em>Days</em> is NBC&#8217;s longest running scripted series which has been praised as a thriving piece of television history as it approaches its milestone anniversary on November 8.</p>
<p>Corday has also won the Daytime Emmy Award for &#8220;Music Direction and Composition for a Drama Series&#8221; in both 1990 and 1997, and the Film &amp; TV Music Award for &#8220;Best Score for a Television Daytime Drama&#8221; in 2007.</p>
<p>He believes that the success of his show all comes down to storytelling, and that it is the essence of all television success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strong and compelling storytelling is the foundation to the success of any television production,&#8221; said Corday. &#8220;As a proud UCSC alumnus, it is my honor to create this opportunity for the next generation of aspiring television writers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corday is currently the CEO of Corday Productions, the television production company founded by his parents Ted and Betty Corday. Ken and his wife, Sherry, also established the Corday Foundation in 2004, whose philanthropic goodwill supports numerous causes including Children&#8217;s Hospital of Los Angeles, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, and the Rhode Island School of Design.</p>
<p>Increasing support for the Arts Division and endowed chairs are goals of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, which to date has raised more than $210 million in resources for the campus.</p>

<p>Charles and Adrienne Coleman of Greenville, S.C., share their bittersweet feelings about dropping their son, Vernon, off for his freshman year at UC Santa Cruz on September 18.</p>
<p>"Kinda rough," concluded Adrienne. But she added, "I really do like the fact that it's not so big and they have the opportunity to get to know each other. So I feel really good about leaving him 3,000 miles away."</p>
<p>Charles joked, "We'll FaceTime him every hour on the hour until we make sure he's safe!"</p>
<p>But the proud father sees UC Santa Cruz&#8212;only 33 miles from the high-tech hub of Silicon Valley&#8212;as a growth opportunity for his tech-oriented son, as well as for the family. &#160;</p>
<p>"We'll grow through it, he'll grow through it, and we're looking forward to him growing all these great friendships," Charles said.</p>
<p>He and Adrienne are "both proud military," he said, "so we know for him it's going to be some great, lasting relationships that grow through this, just like it was with us where you meet other people from other parts of the world. So it's exciting."</p>

(Photo by Melissa De Witte)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The first UC Santa Cruz students couldn't have imagined the scene at&#160;Saturday night's spectacular Fiat Fifty celebration on campus.</p>
<p>"They ate dinner right over there," said Chancellor George Blumenthal, addressing a capacity crowd of 750 revelers, and pointing in the direction of the nearby East Field House. "And here we are, eating in a tent! But I'm sure they didn't eat as well as we're eating tonight."</p>
<p>Blumenthal was right about that. The 21,600-square-foot tent in question stood in floodlights on the East Field overlooking Monterey Bay, and the food in question was fresh and organic haute cuisine in a menu designed by legendary chef Alice Waters, with 120 cooks and waitstaff preparing and delivering it to the tables.</p>
<p>Dinner entertainment by local arts organization Tandy Beal &amp; Co. had diners cheering and gasping at the sight of artists leaping through balanced hoops and performing other feats of agility and strength.</p>
<p>They also watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJCCrT1Eb_c">film presentation that took them right back to the possibility and excitement of 1965</a>.</p>
<p>The speakers kept a strong focus on how much ground the students and professors have covered over the years, and the achieving of seemingly impossible goals. Chancellor Blumenthal spoke of the people who rose to meet the challenge of the organically grown strawberry and the quest to map the human genome. But it was also an evening with light touches and surreal and sublime moments: diners mingling with performers dressed whimsically as peacocks, bears, and giant birds, a juggler beckoning people toward their seats.</p>
<h3>Big, bold, quirky</h3>
<p>The grand celebration was meant to be a big and bold but quirky statement: UC Santa Cruz has come a long way from its humble roots but it has not abandoned its creativity and iconoclastic spirit. The evening's entertainment&#8212;Tandy Beal &amp; Co.'s gravity-defying, pole-climbing, limb-contorting dance troupe, performing alongside a capella group SoVoS&#243;&#8212;illustrated that spirit. So did the evening's keynote speaker and Foundation Medal honoree Alice Waters, the celebrated chef and food activist who spoke of her kindred spirit with UC Santa Cruz, and in particular its pioneering Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.</p>
<p>Someone yelled "Go Alice!" as the food impresario took to the podium. Waters drew loud cheers after she made a sly joke about the Fiat Fifty logistics early on in her presentation, noting that she "never liked eating in a tent, but you've put on the greatest show on Earth."</p>
<p>She continued by saying she resonates with the work being done at UC Santa Cruz, "an institution that has nurtured me and is really close to my heart, an institution that still expresses so many of the values I cherish and I fight for every day." She noted that Chez Panisse opened its doors in 1971, the same year the farming program started at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>She had special praise for alumni who have been "on the forefront of the (food) movement, who paved the way" for farmers, teachers, cooks, community activists, and policymakers who learned the power of connecting with the land from this campus. Among them, she singled out Drew Goodman of Earthbound Farm, professor and researcher V. Ernesto Mendez, Greens Restaurant founding chef Deborah Madison, and Nikki Silva and Davia Nelson, otherwise known as The Kitchen Sisters.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Waters <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/alice-waters.html">toured the 33-acre UC Santa Cruz farm</a> and visted with apprentices in the CASFS Ecological Horticulture program before having lunch at the Alan Chadwick Garden where an organic agriculture project first began on campus in 1967.</p>
<p>Waters, who had a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/alice-waters-q-and-a.html">candid conversation</a> about life and food with UC Santa Cruz's <em>Review</em> magazine this summer, also praised the dedicated UC Santa Cruz students who work at the Homeless Garden Project in town.</p>
<p>"I don't think it can be overemphasized that UC Santa Cruz and Chez Panisse were born in the free speech movement," she said. Those currents fed both the intellectual community on campus as well as the menu at her groundbreaking restaurant.</p>
<h3>True originals</h3>
<p>The evening was also a time to celebrate the original students, staff, and faculty members who took such bold risks and helped establish UC Santa Cruz as an intellectual powerhouse at a time of cultural and political foment.</p>
<p>A special Fiat Lux Award was accepted by Hal Hyde, founding vice chancellor of business and finance, and emeriti faculty members John Dizikes and Jean Langenheim.</p>
<p>Langenheim drew whoops from the crowd when she mentioned spending "45 of my now 90 years" teaching at UC Santa Cruz. She spoke of all the devoted faculty who could just not pull themselves away from the campus and kept giving it their intellectual and creative energy long after they retired.</p>
<p>Master of ceremonies was Kathryn Sullivan (Stevenson '73, Earth sciences), the first American woman to walk in space. She told the crowd about the various ways UC Santa Cruz changed her life.</p>
<p>"When I arrived on campus in 1969, I was horrified and annoyed at the requirement to take three science courses," she admitted. "I did everything I could to get out of taking them." But two of the professors who taught those dreaded classes&#8212;Biology Professor Todd Newberry and Earth Sciences Professor Gary Griggs&#8212;changed her life and kindled her first serious interest in science.</p>
<p>Said Sullivan, "They saw the world expand before the eyes of a young student."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJCCrT1Eb_c</url><title>Fiat Fifty video honors pioneer staff and faculty</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/pioneer-class-reunion-feature-story.html</url><title>Pioneer class reunites and remembers</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://casfs.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/alice-waters.html</url><title>Alice Waters tours campus farm and garden</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="164701c08072701721067acfbd473a3b"><name>pioneer-class-reunion-feature-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reuniting and remembering</title><summary>Pioneer student reunion brings together UC Santa Cruz's original students for laughs, insights, and memories of the unique and intense educational experience of the campus's first years </summary><start-date>1443439500000</start-date><display-name>pioneer-class-reunion-spirit-of-65</display-name><path>/2015/09/pioneer-class-reunion-feature-story</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/09/pioneer-class-reunion-feature-story</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1443482763677</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1443483025705</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/pioneer-class-photo.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/pioneer-class-photo.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pioneer-class-photo.jpg</name><display-name>pioneer-class-photo.jpg</display-name><file-size>42064</file-size><width>600</width><height>216</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/09/images/pioneer-class-photo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/09/images/pioneer-class-photo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pioneer-class-photo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>pioneer-class-photo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15685</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>A robust crowd of more than 200 students in UC Santa Cruz's pioneer class (pictured here in this vintage photo) returned to campus on Saturday.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Exactly 50 years from the day they first arrived on campus and moved into temporary trailers on the East Field, 211 of UC Santa Cruz's original students converged on campus.</p>
<p>The first-ever Pioneer Reunion took place Saturday in the East Field House, a place that everyone from the Class of '69 remembers as a room of many purposes, from the serving of meals to the playing of sports and the teaching of Professor William Hitchcock's legendary World Civilization classes. Though it was many years ago, returning graduates could still remember Hitchcock kicking things off by assigning the first reading: H.D. F. Kitto's The Greeks, which inspired the classmates to give each other long and ridiculous "Homeric nicknames."</p>
<p>Fifteen pioneer faculty also showed up, as did Peter Smith, founding chancellor Dean McHenry's executive assistant; Smith traveled all the way from Buffalo, N.Y., to be there.</p>
<p>The returning Slugs were well into their 60s, but the reunion was so full of energy and political savvy, with hints of political activism and protest, that it could have just as easily been a group of engaged undergraduates. When pioneer Professor of Psychology and Sociology G. William Domhoff, an original faculty member, was addressing the crowd, someone loudly asked him what might be done about the American oligarchy.</p>
<p>Domhoff's talk harkened back to the original incarnation of UC Santa Cruz, a university with a small-college format and no established traditions. He also reflected fondly about the inevitable tensions that can happen when faculty members urge the students to express themselves in the most authentic way possible, and then register their shock at the results.</p>
<p>"Dean McHenry was a liberal," Domhoff said. "But as you all know, Dean was somewhat uptight. They told us to have our own ideas, and when we did, they told us they didn't like them&#8230;. There were generational differences."</p>
<p><strong>Responding with creativity</strong><br/>
 Pioneer student Paul Rabwin remembered when he moved off campus to a four-room cabin in the now-exclusive Pasatiempo area and paid $40 a month for it.</p>
<p>He also expressed the thrill of coming to a new campus and writing one's own future. "We were forced to intellectually create our own environment" from scratch, he said.</p>
<p>Rabwin approached founding Cowell College provost Page Smith and told him he'd like to form a musical group but didn't know where to begin. He didn't even have sheet music to distribute. Smith reached into his pocket, gave Rabwin $100, and told him to go forth and get the group going.</p>
<p>Rabwin then started the Cowell Madrigal Singers.</p>
<p>"Every one of us is overwhelmingly enthusiastic about the time we had here," Rabwin said. "We all had our careers shaped by being forced into a situation where we had to respond with creativity."</p>
<p><strong>Photos and interviews</strong><br/>
 Smith left UC Santa Cruz in 1973 and died in 1995, but he watched over the proceedings with an admiring and wistful expression. Black and white photos of Smith&#8212;courtesy of pioneer student Eric Thiermann&#8212;were framed and mounted on folding chairs at the sides of the field house, one of them showing Smith riding a horse, another depicting him with a long rifle in his hands. The other snapshots were straight out of the radical late 1960s era of UC Santa Cruz life; several retirement-age people stood around, chuckling at a photo featuring nine clothed young men standing next to a woman wearing nothing but a broad-brimmed hat, earrings, and an inscrutable expression.</p>
<p>The pioneers had a unique mentorship opportunity: Each of them submitted to intensive interviews by current UC Santa Cruz students&#8212;a rare mingling of Slug generations. Michael Arighi, a '69 Cowell graduate, urged the undergraduates to "Take all that is offered and embrace it with both arms. You will get things you don't expect out of it. You don't know if Path A is really where you'll end up or not. I'm on Path D and it's worked out for me very well."</p>
<p><strong>'We were it'</strong><br/>
 Marjorie Rasmussen (Cowell '69, U.S. history) loved the early freewheeling spirit of the place. "There was no one above us," she said, referring to the original frosh on campus. "We didn't have upperclassmen to tell us we were idiots. We were it." She said the classes were quite challenging, "but the professors made it interesting. They engaged us, and made our opinions feel worthwhile."</p>
<p>She also chuckled at way that students had to communicate with the outside world back then. The temporary trailers where the students first lived (because the dorms weren't done yet) were arranged like the spokes of a wheel. In the middle of each "wagon wheel" formation stood a single and highly coveted phone booth. In those days before smartphones, young scholars would stare out their windows all the time to see if the phone was in use.</p>
<p>Reunion attendants read a loving and sometimes uproarious informal history of the Pioneer Class and the early campus, prepared by Judy Einzig (Cowell '69, psychology). Her hand-out, on sky-blue paper, mentioned the mathematician and cellist who taught a Zen Buddhism class, and the social philosopher and humanities professor Norman O. Brown leading his class to the Quarry, then burning his famous book, Love's Body, there.</p>

Webster Jr. Presidential Chair for the UC Santa Cruz Natural Reserves</strong>.</p>
<p>The gift provides support for research, teaching, and maintenance activities in the natural reserves, as well as for research internships and fellowships for students.</p>
<p>"The reserves serve as living labs and outdoor classrooms, and this endowment will help provide the infrastructure and support we need to maintain the reserves, broaden the opportunities for students to have hands-on experiences in nature, and support graduate student and faculty research," said Gage Dayton, administrative director of the UCSC Natural Reserves.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz manages four of the 39 sites in the <a href="http://nrs.ucop.edu/">UC Natural Reserve System</a> (NRS), as well as a campus reserve. The NRS is a network of protected natural areas throughout California encompassing more than 756,000 acres and providing undisturbed environments for research and teaching. The UCSC reserves include <a href="http://nrs.ucop.edu/reserves/ano_nuevo/ano_nuevo.htm">A&#241;o Nuevo Island Reserve</a>, <a href="http://nrs.ucop.edu/reserves/fort_ord/fort_ord.htm">Fort Ord Natural Reserve</a>, <a href="http://nrs.ucop.edu/reserves/big_creek/landels_hill_big_creek.htm">Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve</a>, <a href="http://nrs.ucop.edu/reserves/younger_lagoon/younger_lagoon.htm">Younger Lagoon Reserve</a>, and the UCSC <a href="http://ucsantacruz.ucnrs.org/reserves/ucsc-campus/">Campus Natural Reserve</a>.</p>
<p>"We've been working hard not just to be good stewards of the reserves but to get more students out into the field to take advantage of the fact that UCSC is surrounded by these amazing natural areas," said Donald Croll, faculty director of the UCSC Natural Reserves and a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. "Experience-based learning is a hallmark of UC Santa Cruz, and the natural reserves are an unparalleled resource for students in ecology and other environmental sciences."</p>
<p><strong>Support for students</strong></p>
<p>According to Dayton, support for infrastructure and maintenance of the reserves will ensure that they can be used effectively for research and teaching activities. In addition, funds from the endowed chair will provide support for students to take classes and conduct research projects in the reserves, including fellowships for graduate students and research internships for undergraduates.</p>
<p>"This endowment will have an immediate impact on the reserves and a lasting impact on the students and faculty who use the reserves," Dayton said. "The Natural Reserve System is the training ground for the next generation of conservation biologists. It is so powerful when students are able to experience the concepts they're learning and apply them in a natural setting."</p>
<p>Increasing support for endowed chairs is a goal of the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>, which has raised more than $210 million for the campus. Croll said this new endowed chair provides recognition for the importance of the Natural Reserve System to the mission of the university.</p>
<p>"The Natural Reserves are a major laboratory and irreplaceable asset for UC Santa Cruz and others," said Alec Webster, co-president and secretary of the Helen and Will Webster Foundation. "They teach problem solving, and their use is interdisciplinary and hands-on, demanding students to actually observe and speculate in a broad, encompassing, and critical manner. Supporting them is essential."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Exceptional impact</strong></p>
<p>The Webster Family has had an exceptional impact on the UC Santa Cruz campus, providing gifts to benefit several areas including the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, the Libraries, and the Natural Reserves.</p>
<p>Alec Webster ('02, College Eight) came to UC Santa Cruz in 1987 after attending UC Santa Barbara. He worked for the Santa Cruz Institute of Particle Physics as a machinist and lab technician. That experience transformed him into a serious student with a deep interest in food production, forestry, and social justice issues, which led to a B.A. in environmental studies from UC Santa Cruz, with highest honors.</p>
<p>Alec and his wife Claudia (UC Santa Barbara, '75, Art) currently serve on the Social Sciences Dean's Board of Councilors, and Alec is a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee. Alec has also served on the South Campus Vision Council, which ignited his passion for the campus historic district and led to the Helen and Will Webster Foundation providing a gift for renovation and programming for the Cowell Hay Barn. The Helen and Will Webster Foundation is dedicated to public education and well-being.</p>

<p>Under the new UC Fair Wage/Fair Work Plan, all employees hired to work at least 20 hours a week will be paid a minimum of $13 an hour starting Thursday, Oct. 1. That minimum will increase to $14 an hour on Oct. 1, 2016, and to $15 an hour on Oct. 1, 2017.</p>
<p>Contractors and subcontractors working on UC projects will be required to comply with the new policy.</p>
<p>UC is the first university in the country to voluntarily set a $15 minimum wage. The new rate will be higher than California's minimum wage, which is currently $9 an hour and will increase to $10 an hour on Jan. 1, 2016.</p>
<p>President Janet Napolitano announced the UC Fair Wage/Fair Work Plan in July to support employees and their families, and to ensure that workers being paid through a UC contract are likewise fairly compensated.</p>
<p>"Supporting the employees - and their families - who help make UC a leading institution is an important part of our values as a public university, " President Napolitano said.<br/>
The new minimum wage is being implemented over three years to give campuses time to plan and budget for the cost increase. The bulk of the cost will be funded by non-core funds, such as sales from self-supporting programs like bookstores and food services. These are separate from tuition and fees, state resources and other core funds that support UC's core instructional programs.</p>
<p>As UC enters into new contracts or renews existing ones, the university will require contractors and subcontractors to pay their employees a wage that meets or exceeds UC's new minimum wage.</p>
<p>In addition, UC will enhance its oversight of contractors and subcontractors for wages and working conditions. This includes creation of a telephone hotline and online reporting system, both now in place, that contract workers can use to report complaints and issues directly to the Office of the President.</p>
<p>It also will include annual and interim audits of contractors to ensure they pay employees UC's minimum wage or better, and that they meet all local, state, federal and UC laws. Annual audits will be funded by the contractors, and implemented as new contracts are established and existing ones are renewed.</p>

<p><a href="http://lex.ucsc.edu/resources/datalex_registration.html">"Privacy, Big Data and the Law"</a> will explore the legal and ethical issues that arise from the growing use of big data, said UC Santa Cruz Chief Campus Counsel Michael Troncoso. This is the first in a series of DataLex events this coming year that will look at new topics at the intersection of big data and the law.</p>
<p>"While data analytics promise to unlock extraordinary advances in productivity and research, fascinating legal and ethical issues arise as Big Data is deployed in new contexts," Troncoso said. "This event will bring together some of the leaders in the field to discuss how it will affect people for years to come."<br/>
For the inaugural event, DataLex will feature data scientists, policymakers, legal scholars, and privacy advocates to collectively consider these important issues using technical, social and ethical lenses simultaneously.</p>
<p>The event is part of UC Santa Cruz Data Science Week. Registration for the Oct. 13 event is $99 and can be done <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2019&amp;cid=3745">online</a>.</p>
<p>Jim Dempsey, executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law &amp; Technology, will give the opening address. Dempsey is a leading expert on privacy, who has spent nearly two decades with the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology. Additionally, he was appointed by President Barack Obama to serve on the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an independent agency within the executive branch charged with advisory and oversight roles regarding the nation's counterterrorism programs.</p>
<p>Travis LeBlanc, chief of enforcement for the Federal Communications Commission, will deliver a lunchtime keynote talk on the development and regulation of the information economy and emerging issues in privacy enforcement.</p>
<p>The day will be broken into three panels. The first will explore privacy with genomic data and whether restrictions are holding back precision medicine.</p>
<p>The second panel will look at whether algorithms are fair or whether they can discriminate when it comes to grading, rewarding, hiring and firing people.</p>
<p>The final panel will focus on data governance and tools for navigating institutional values and regulatory uncertainty.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1b012f4d8072701721067acf5232a7ad"><name>mail-theft-fsh</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Crime Bulletin: Mail theft on campus</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department has received multiple reports of mail theft from residents in Family Student Housing (FSH) in the past couple weeks.</summary><start-date>1443250800000</start-date><display-name>Community Crime Bulletin: Mail theft on campus</display-name><path>/2015/09/mail-theft-fsh</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/09/mail-theft-fsh</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1443562073894</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1443562073894</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department has received multiple reports of mail theft from residents in Family Student Housing (FSH) in the past couple weeks.</div>

<div><strong>Tips to avoid mail theft</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Always use a blue post office collection box or deposit your mail inside the post office. &#8232;</li>
<li>Whether you have a home mailbox or use a post office box, you should always collect your mail on the day it is delivered. Never leave it in your mailbox overnight.&#8232;</li>
<li>Mail thieves look for bank statements and credit card bills, which can be used to create counterfeit checks or fake identifications. &#8232;</li>
<li>Thieves also look for personal checks enclosed in utility bills or other payments. Thieves take these stolen checks, remove the ink, and then fill out the blank check in their names and desired amount. &#8232;</li>
<li>Never send cash through the mail. When reordering checks, have them sent to your bank. &#8232;</li>
<li>When you travel, ask a trusted friend or neighbor to pick up your mail. &#8232;</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t receive a check, bill or other mail you are expecting, contact the issuing agency immediately.&#160;</li>

The effort is funded by two grants, one from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and another from Bat Conservation International and The Nature Conservancy. The UCSC team has also received two other grants from USFWS for studies of the ecology and epidemiology of the disease.</p>
<p>White-nose syndrome has devastated bat populations throughout eastern North America and continues to spread westward across the continent. Marm Kilpatrick and Winifred Frick in UCSC's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology have been at the forefront of research on the disease, conducting field surveys to help track its spread and studying the dynamics of disease transmission and the impacts on bat populations.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a study led by UCSC graduate student Joseph Hoyt showed that bacteria found naturally on some bats can inhibit the growth of the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome. After conducting additional tests of the bacteria on bats in the lab, the researchers wanted to see if applying it to bats in the wild can improve bats' chances of surviving the fungal infection.</p>
<p>"It's a small-scale field trial to test the efficacy of augmenting the amount of the bacteria that naturally occurs on the bats," said Frick.</p>
<p><strong>Antifungal treatment<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>In addition, the researchers will test an antifungal product called chitosan, derived from the exoskeletons of insects and crustaceans. Kilpatrick said he offered to add a chitosan treatment arm to the planned field trial after seeing the results of laboratory tests conducted by Maarten Vonhoff at Western Michigan University. The trial will be conducted in an abandoned mine located at the leading edge of the spread of the disease.<br/>
<br/>
 "We've been monitoring the bats that hibernate in this mine, and the fungus first arrived there last year. Based on past experience, we anticipate that pretty much all of the bats will become infected when they return this year, with a mortality rate of 50 to 80 percent," Kilpatrick said. "If we can reduce the mortality rate to 30 percent or less, that could have a meaningful impact."</p>
<p>Frick and Kilpatrick are driven by a sense of urgency in the face of an epidemic that has decimated bat populations over large areas of North America. According to Kilpatrick, one species, the northern long-eared bat, appears to be headed for extinction, and the populations of several other species have crashed, declining by as much as 90 percent across large ranges.</p>
<p>"We need to act quickly and try to find solutions," said Frick.</p>
<p><strong>Remnant populations</strong></p>
<p>Another project funded by a USFWS grant will look at remnant populations of little brown bats in New York state, seeking to understand how a few populations have managed to stabilize after an initial crash. White-nose syndrome first emerged in upstate New York in 2006, and there are a handful of sites where populations of little brown bats initially declined by 75 percent but have since remained level or even increased slightly over the past few years. At most other sites populations have declined by more than 95 percent.</p>
<p>"If we can find the mechanism for how these populations are persisting we will have a better idea what their long-term prospects are," Frick said.</p>
<p>In a 2010 paper, Frick predicted that regional extinctions of little brown bats were likely within the next 16 years, but now she says their prospects look better. "I'm happy to be wrong about that, but we don't have a clear understanding of why some populations are persisting," she said.</p>
<p>A third project that also received funding will look at the disease dynamics of white-nose syndrome in a region outside North America where the fungus is endemic. The USFWS this week announced $2.5 million in grants for research on white-nose syndrome, including the UCSC grants.</p>
<p><strong>Pest control</strong></p>
<p>"Bats are a critical part of our ecology and provide essential pest control for our farmers, foresters and city residents, limiting the need to spray harmful pesticides," said USFWS director Dan Ashe. "As the disease continues its spread into new areas, it is more critical than ever that we continue our strong support for solid science to inform wise decisions about our natural resources."</p>
<p>Together with the BCI/TNC grant, the UC Santa Cruz team received a total of nearly $300,000 for the white-nose syndrome research program. Frick and Kilpatrick will be collaborating on these projects with researchers at the University of New Hampshire, University of Winnipeg, Harvard University, Northeast Normal University in China, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Arizona State University.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/04/bat-disease-treatment.html</url><title>Bacteria

<p>Johnston, a senior fellow at the Center for Political Ecology, a Santa Cruz-based nonprofit, most recently taught an environmental studies class, Amazon Cultures and Conservation, in spring 2015.</p>
<p>She is scheduled to receive the award November 20 when the association holds its annual meeting in Denver where she will deliver a formal lecture on her science and human rights work. She is sharing the award with Edward &#8220;Ted&#8221; Harman of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln.</p>
<p>The award honors anthropological insights and analyses from the implementation of effective and beneficial policies within the last five years. &#8220;We were impressed with both of these nominees and felt their work showcased the spectrum of policy contributions that we seek to honor with this award,&#8221; said Susan Bibler Coutin, chair of the Anthropology in Public Policy Award Committee, in a statement. &#8220;Their collective research and insights have had lasting and significant impacts on global policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnston's research addresses linkages between environment, health, and human rights with the objective of documenting human environmental rights abuse, and strengthening accountability in international development, water resource management, and nuclear disaster.</p>
<p>Her study documenting the consequences of the Chixoy Dam in Guatemala helped inform negotiations over reparations for local residents displaced by the dam, built during Guatemala's repressive military dictatorship. The project, financed by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, was built on the Chixoy River in the early 1980s and forcibly displaced more than 3,500 Maya Achi community members. More than 6,000 families living in the area also suffered loss of land and livelihoods.</p>
<p>The study encouraged U.S. restrictions on World Bank and other international financial institutions financing in Guatemala and led to the adoption of a formal reparation mechanism that addresses injuries and impoverishment resulting from internationally financed hydroelectric dam development.</p>

<p>What was remarkable was not the descriptions of the canal rides or beautiful churches, but rather that Adams&#8217;s colleague was blind and was using a mobile app the 28-year-old UC Santa Cruz grad student had designed to recognize and describe the vacation shots she had taken.</p>
<p>The app, which has already won two prestigious design awards, allows someone who is visually impaired to not only recognize their photos but also to organize them and even share their shots through social media.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a technological accomplishment that may seem counterintuitive on its face &#8212; until, as Adams explains, not only are there are a number of famous photographers who are visually impaired but also that a Flickr group set up for blind photographers has 386 members and nearly 10,000 photos.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like the idea of using technology to help people do things,&#8221; Adams says.</p>
<p>Raised on a cattle- and hay-ranch near Huntsville, Texas, Adams had always been interested in human/computer interaction.&#160; But it wasn&#8217;t until he met UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Computational Media and Computer Engineering Sri Kurniawan that he found his passion. He began working in her Interactive Systems for Individuals with Special Needs lab.</p>
<p>The idea for his app, which he would later name VizSnap, came during a National Science Foundation-funded internship he won at IBM&#8217;s Tokyo Accessibility Research Lab in Japan.</p>
<p>Inspired by his group leader there, a blind accessibility researcher and IBM Fellow named Chieko Asakawa, Adams spent six to nine months programming the app, then spent more months conducting user studies and refining the technological tool.</p>
<p>In its current incarnation, VizSnap allows a user to make an audio recording of the environment where the photo is being taken in order to help identify the shot. It also notes date, time, and location, while permitting the photographer to give a voice memo about the captured image.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the misconceptions is that if you&#8217;re blind, you don&#8217;t take photos,&#8221; says Kurniawan of Adams&#8217;s technology. &#8220;But why do we take photos? Some people say it is to remind them of when they were, say, in Paris. But many also say they take photos to show family and friends back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>VizSnap allows them to do both.</p>
<p>Available for free download, VizSnap won first prize in the design competition at the MobileHCI (Human-Computer Interaction) conference two years ago and nabbed second place at the Big Ideas @ Berkeley competition.</p>
<p>Adams is still refining his app and is looking for more users for a long-term study with the technology.&#160; But he believes the work he &#8212; and others in Kurniawan&#8217;s lab &#8212; are doing is important because people with disabilities are often overlooked when new technology is being developed.</p>
<p>&#160; &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s intentional,&#8221; Adams says, &#8220;but it ends up to be a form of discrimination. People are left out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Along with Adams&#8217;s app, other adaptive technologies are under development in Kurniawan&#8217;s lab, including a video game to help children with corrected cleft palates and lips learn to speak more clearly, a computer app that allows those with visual impairments to independently format documents, and a special glove that can ease the symptoms of those with hand tremors.</p>
&#8220;I think this all fits in well with the ethos of UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Adams says of the work he has done. &#8220;It (the university) does a good job of trying to include people.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a26a44b38072704638f4f222685d0ecc"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1325408400000</start-date><path>/2015/09/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/09/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1420064081047</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1420064081047</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
