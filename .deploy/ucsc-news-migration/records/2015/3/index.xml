<p>Chen received the NERSC 2015 Early Career Award for High Impact Scientific Achievement for his research on the explosion of very massive stars in multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>The awards recognize NERSC users who have either demonstrated an innovative use of high-performance computing resources to solve a scientific problem, or whose work has had an exceptional impact on scientific understanding or society. The Early Career awards encourage younger scientists who are using high-performance computing in their research. The winners were honored on February 24, 2015, during the annual NERSC User Group meeting at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</p>
<p>Chen "is a rising star in computational astrophysics" and "the world's leader in the 2D and 3D study of massive star death that does not involve iron-core collapse and neutrinos (massive thermonuclear supernovae)," wrote Stan Woosley, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, in Chen's nomination letter.</p>
<p>In 2014, Chen was lead author and Woosley a coauthor of a study published in <i>Astrophysical Journal</i> that revealed that certain primordial stars&#8212;those between 55,000 and 56,000 times the mass of the Sun&#8212;may have died unusually. In death, these objects would have exploded as supernovae and burned completely, leaving no remnant black hole behind. Chen's simulations indicated that after supermassive stars burn through their hydrogen fuel and begin to collapse, what happens internally depends critically on the star's mass. If it is less than 55,000 or more than 56,000 solar masses, the supermassive star explodes and leaves behind a supermassive black hole. Within that specific mass range, however, special processes in the star's core lead to instability that triggers an explosion so violent that it completely unbinds the star and leaves no compact remnant.</p>
<p>This study garnered much attention in the popular press, in large part because of the eye-catching visualizations Chen created based on his supernova simulations.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/09/unusual-supernova.html</url><title>Simulations reveal unusual death for ancient stars</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/nersc-news/nersc-center-news/2015/nersc-honors-third-annual-hpc-achievement-award-winners/</url><title>NERSC honors third annual HPC Achievement Award winners</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dcdd53d28072701752fca25e7440da20"><name>ferguson-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Benefits of internationalization</title><summary>By Joel Ferguson, Associate Vice Provost of International Education — To borrow from President John F.

Kennedy: My fellow Banana Slugs, ask not what you can do for internationalization, ask what internationalization can do for you. <br/><br/>I ask &#8220;what internationalization can do for you&#8221; because internationalization is not a goal in and of itself. Internationalization is a means for us to further the research, education, and public service mission of UC Santa Cruz and to support you as faculty, staff, or student.<br/><br/>We have internationally born faculty and international graduate students spread out over almost all departments directly involved in world-class research and teaching. Without their contributions, we would be missing the perspectives and skills we need to remain on the cutting edge of research. Our entire community would be impoverished without the diversity of perspectives, expertise, and life experience they bring.<br/><br/>Our international faculty, graduate students, and our increasingly international undergraduate student population help all students develop the inter-cultural skills needed to excel in today&#8217;s diverse global society. Just as our departmental and divisional communities would be diminished without our international faculty colleagues, I predict that within a few years our student body will not be able to imagine UC Santa Cruz without the diversity of opinions and perspectives that a robust population of international students brings. <br/><br/>Our students who take advantage of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s study-abroad programs gain additional inter-cultural competencies and a sense of self-reliance that serves them well for the rest of their college career and after graduation, as well. For those who choose not to study abroad, the presence of international students on campus brings the rest of the world closer and makes the people in it more accessible.<br/><br/>In the near future, the international education office, led by <a href="https://www.ue.ucsc.edu/George2015">Director Becky George</a> and I, in partnership with other campus units, will add the following services for you, the faculty, staff, and students of UCSC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student intern visa processing to allow international students to work in faculty labs for short periods of time;</li>
<li>Faster H-1B processing to better serve anyone hiring international researchers;</li>
<li>A language and writing track for international students who need to improve their communication skills (in partnership with the Writing Program);</li>
<li>Support for faculty-led courses abroad to reinvigorate teaching, service, and research and to make study abroad more accessible for underserved student populations;</li>
<li>Recruitment of sponsored international students to further diversify the student population and to support Ph.D. programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I ask: What more can internationalization do for you to improve UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s research, education, service to the world, and community?&#160; Please contact me at <a href="mailto:fjf@ucsc.edu">fjf@ucsc.edu</a> with your suggestions.<br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dd011e648072701752fca25ec0460d3a"><name>rev-spring-15-exquisite-campus</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Exquisite campus </title><summary>A common refrain among UC Santa Cruz alumni—from every decade, every major, every college, every division—is how much they treasured the beauty and natural setting of this remarkable campus and the richness it brought to their educational experience. </summary><keywords>UC Santa Cruz, beauty</keywords><start-date>1429642800000</start-date><display-name>Exquisite campus </display-name><path>/2015/03/rev-spring-15-exquisite-campus</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/rev-spring-15-exquisite-campus</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1425342012994</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1429743682894</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Jourdonnais</name><title></title><phone/><email>review@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/exq-campus-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/exq-campus-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>exq-campus-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>exq-campus-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25892</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Redwood canopy</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A common refrain among UC Santa Cruz alumni&#8212;from every decade, every major, every college, every division&#8212;is how much they treasured the beauty and natural setting of this remarkable campus and the richness it brought to their educational experience.

<p>As part of UC Santa Cruz's 50th anniversary recognition, we present a photo essay celebrating this stunning university environment. From the dizzying heights of the redwood forests &#8230; to the mind-expanding views of big sky and endless meadows tumbling to the bay, combined with breathtaking glimpses of the magnificent wildlife sharing this dramatic space.</p>
<p>Architecture blends into the land and surrounding forest, and includes everything from rustic historical structures to sleek, modern designs.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz campus&#8212;beautiful, bewildering, bewitching. We look forward to welcoming generations of students to come who will similarly immerse and revel in the beauty of this place and continue the quest to change the world.</p>

<ul>
<li>The ground must be free of standing water in the area targeted for spraying.</li>
<li>One day post application National Weather Service forecast must predict a chance of rain no greater than 20 percent.</li>
<li>Conditions must be calm (not windy) at time of spray.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trained and licensed operators will do all spraying in strict conformance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Santa Cruz County Agricultural Commissioner, UCSC&#8217;s Environmental Health and Safety Office, and the manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations.

The approximately 47 acres of natural areas (Younger Lagoon Reserve Terrace Lands) were incorporated into Younger Lagoon Reserve in July 2008, bringing the size of the reserve to approximately 72 acres. <br/><br/>Restoration of the Younger Lagoon Reserve Terrace Lands will take place over the next 20 years under the guidance of a Scientific Advisory Committee made up of restoration practitioners and academics. The goal of restoration efforts on the Terrace Lands is to create a mosaic of habitats that provide substantial ecosystem services including the preservation of biodiversity, habitat for special status species, and buffering of stormwater runoff.&#160; These habitats include coastal bluff, coastal prairie, seasonal wetlands, forested wetlands and grasslands.&#160; Additionally, because the site is a UC Natural Reserve, research focused on restoration and native flora and fauna will provide opportunities to guide future restoration in similar habitats and provide educational and outreach material for Reserve users.</p>

Campus leaders will investigate the incident and the reported involvement of UCSC students.<br/> <br/> As we have said before, we fully respect the free-speech rights of students, faculty, and staff to engage in lawful protest. However, we cannot support actions that infringe on the rights and movement of others. <br/> <br/> We are all members of this community, and we deeply regret the impact these events had on our neighbors. It's more than just an inconvenience; obstructing traffic jeopardizes public safety in ways that potentially could put people's lives at risk. We strongly condemn this form of public protest and will exert our full responsibility as campus leaders to discourage its use in the future.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e662a7118072701752fca25ec703b264"><name>casfs-training-manual</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New 3rd edition of  'Teaching Organic Farming &amp; Gardening' now available</title><summary>Drawing on nearly 50 years of experience, "Teaching Organic Farming &amp; Gardening: Resources for Instructors, 3rd Edition" addresses practical aspects of organic farming and gardening, applied soil science, and social and environmental issues in agriculture.&#13;

Although much of the material has been developed for field or garden demonstrations and skill building, most of the units can also be tailored to a classroom setting.<br/><br/>The 700-page manual was produced by UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food System and is designed for a wide audience of those involved in teaching farming and gardening skills and sustainable agriculture concepts, including colleges and universities with sustainable agriculture programs, student farms or gardens, and on-farm education programs; urban agriculture, community garden, and farm training programs; farms with internships or apprenticeships; agriculture extension stations; school gardening programs; organizations such as the Peace Corps, US AID, and other groups that provide international training in food growing and ecological growing methods; and master gardener programs.<br/><br/>Copies of the teaching guide can be purchased at cost (see ordering details, below), and all of the text is also available free online in pdf files, supplemented by Powerpoint-style presentations and video links for many of the units. The material can be accessed at <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu/about/publications/Teaching-Organic-Farming">casfs.ucsc.edu/about/publications/Teaching-Organic-Farming</a>. <br/><br/>Part 1 of the manual, Organic Farming and Gardening Skills and Practices, emphasizes the &#8220;how-to&#8221; aspects of organic gardening and farming, including propagation, irrigation, tillage, transplanting, and compost production. This 11-unit section also introduces students to critical skills and considerations in the management of soil fertility and agricultural pests (arthropods, diseases, and weeds) in organic systems. The information included in the manual is based on certified organic production practices that meet or exceed the National Organic Program (NOP) standards. Included throughout is an overview of principles and practices used in NOP-certified production.<br/><br/>Part 2, Applied Soil Science, covers basic information on soil chemistry, soil physical properties, and soil biology and ecology, providing a more detailed overview of the underlying scientific principles that inform many of the organic farming practices covered in Part 1. <br/><br/>Part 3, Social and Environmental Issues in Agriculture, first outlines the history and development of agriculture in the U.S. and then introduces students to social and environmental issues associated with conventional agriculture practices and the current organization of the food system. This section also introduces the concept of sustainable agriculture and current food justice efforts, and some of the existing obstacles to more sustainable food and agriculture systems.<br/><br/><em>Teaching Organic Gardening and Farming: Resources for Instructors</em> is designed to be placed in a 3-inch, 3-ring binder so that sections can be easily removed and copied for class use. It is available from the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems for $55 plus $5 for shipping in the U.S. (please inquire about international shipping costs).&#160; Price includes tax and handling; binder not included.<br/><br/>To order, send a check or money order made payable to UC Regents to: CASFS, 1156 High St., Santa Cruz, CA&#160; 95064, attn: Teaching Manual.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Accessibility</span> &#8211; Employees are expected to work their normal schedules on Thursday, March 5<sup>th</sup>.&#160; Please check campus accessibility before coming to work.&#160; Information about actual impacts will be posted on the campus web site. Please check the campus&#160;home page(<a href="ucsc.edu">ucsc.edu</a>) or go directly to a&#160;web page&#160;(<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/02/campus-advisory.html">http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/02/campus-advisory.html)</a> for information about transportation, dining, and other services that could be impacted.</p>
<p>In addition to updating the web page as information warrants, the Public Affairs Office will be:</p>
<p>&#183; Recording information on the campus's communications hotline, 459-INFO&#160;(831-459-4636).&#160;</p>
<p>&#183; Relaying information on a regular basis to KZSC Radio (88.1 FM) for broadcast.&#160;</p>
<p>&#183; Sharing information via Twitter (<a href="twitter.com/ucsc">twitter.com/ucsc</a>).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Work Flexibility</span> &#8211; In order to minimize the number of people attempting to access campus, employee requests to work from home or from an alternate work site may be considered and approved based on operational needs and divisional protocol.&#160;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Request for Vacation or Compensatory Time Off (CTO)</span> &#8211; Managers and supervisors may approve advanced requests to schedule vacation or CTO in accordance with policy and labor agreements and as it is customarily administered within their unit/division.&#160;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Request for Sick Leave</span> &#8211; Requests for sick leave should be handled in accordance with policy and labor agreements and as it is customarily administered within the unit/division.&#160; For example, if it is normal practice to require a doctor&#8217;s note from an employee who calls in sick, then it is appropriate to do so on this day.&#160; However, if it is not normal to require a doctor&#8217;s note when an employee calls in sick, then a change in practice is not acceptable.&#160; Be advised that a unit/division may be required to provide at a later date that its practice existed prior to March 5th.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Absence without Approval </span>&#8211; If the campus is accessible and an employee is absent without advanced approval to use vacation or CTO and has not called in sick, then the day should be recorded as an unapproved absence and the employee&#8217;s pay will be adjusted in accordance with policy and labor agreements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Absence due to Inaccessibility</span> &#8211; Employees should not be encouraged to enter the campus to work nor should they be transported onto campus if it is deemed inaccessible by the Police Chief.&#160; If the campus is officially determined to be inaccessible, the Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor may approve administrative leave with pay for those employees who are expected to work but are unable to access the workplace.&#160; Campus will be notified should administrative leave with pay be approved.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recording Attendance</span> &#8211; Employee attendance will be reported as normal through CruzPay and other time reporting practices.&#160;</p>
<p>Please be assured that the campus is planning for the day&#8217;s activities and will provide communication updates as the day unfolds.&#160; Questions should be directed to your <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/contact/locate_team.html">Employee &amp; Labor Relations Analyst</a> or your <a href="http://apo.ucsc.edu/contacts/index.html">Divisional Academic Personnel Coordinator</a>.</p>

Supervisors and managers should discuss contingency plans with staff ahead of Thursday. Where appropriate, contingency plans may include telecommute and alternate work site arrangements. Instructors are strongly encouraged to speak with their department chair regarding contingency plans should classroom access be impacted. Additionally, employees may leave their workspace if they do not feel safe, be that because of a demonstration, building occupation, or other major incident.

<p>Scientists have long known that Arctic lakes emit methane, which comes primarily from the action of microbes in the water and lake sediments. Although numerous studies have monitored and documented these emissions, few have examined the effects of seasonally thawed groundwater, which also contains methane and flows into the lakes.</p>
<p>Adina Paytan, a research scientist at UC Santa Cruz, led a team of researchers to study methane concentrations at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Their findings, published March 9 in <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, show that groundwater from the seasonal thawing of the "active layer" of soil above the permafrost adds significantly to the overall concentration of methane in the lake and thus influences the emission of this powerful greenhouse gas to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>"Methane transport from the active layer to Toolik Lake can account for a large fraction of methane emissions from this lake," Paytan said. "This is important because warming in the Arctic may expand the active layer and increase the discharge, leading to increased emissions from Arctic lakes and driving additional global warming."</p>
<p>Although carbon dioxide accounts for the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, methane emissions are also an important factor driving climate change. Methane doesn't last as long in the atmosphere, but it is much more efficient than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. Pound for pound, the effect of methane on climate change is more than 20 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period, according to the <a href="http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html">Environmental Protection Agency</a>.</p>
<p>At Toolik Lake, Paytan and her colleagues tracked methane concentrations concurrently with two naturally occurring elements (radon and radium) that serve as tracers for groundwater. Based on their measurements, they concluded that methane-rich groundwater may be an important and currently unrecognized contributor to methane emissions from Arctic lakes. The study suggests that future warming in the Arctic could expand the active layer and increase methane transport to lakes, and from lakes into the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming.</p>
<p>In addition to Paytan, the coauthors of the paper include Alanna Lecher, Joseph Murray, and Slawek Tulaczyk at UC Santa Cruz; Natasha Dimova at UC Santa Cruz and the University of Alabama; and Katy Sparrow, Fenix Kodovska, and John Kessler at the University of Rochester.

<p>But those impulses will be stronger than ever during this year's festivities, which run from <b>Thursday, April 23, through Sunday, April 26,</b> at UC Santa Cruz. The event serves as one of the anchor pieces of the campus's yearlong 50th anniversary celebration, which kicked off in January with "Dress Like It's 1965 Day."</p>
<p>In honor of this important milestone, organizers have put together the most elaborate Alumni Weekend ever, with more than 70 activities geared to Banana Slugs from all 50 years of the campus's history.</p>
<p>We detail some of the highlights of the gathering here, but there are many more events, happenings, and opportunities throughout the weekend; for a full listing of events and to register, visit the <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu">Alumni Weekend website</a>.</p>
<h3>Thursday kick-off</h3>
<p>Early arrivals&#8212;especially those who've thought about offering a guiding hand to current UC Santa Cruz students&#8212;should flock to <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2802">Mentor Match: A student &amp; alumni networking dinner,</a></b> starting at 7 p.m. at the Stevenson Event Center. The dinner serves as a chance to connect with other Slugs and provide guidance for the next generation.</p>
<h3>Friday festivities</h3>
<p>Among the highlights will be an all-day off-campus <strong><a href="http://www.tedxsantacruz.org/">TEDxSantaCruz</a></strong> event on Friday, April 24, from 10 a.m.&#8211;4 p.m. at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz. The focus of the event, which is partially sponsored by UC Santa Cruz, is "Radical Collaboration." Featured speakers include UC Santa Cruz faculty, graduate students, and alumni.</p>
<p>Back on campus that Friday, the <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2690">11th annual Graduate Research Symposium</a></b>&#8212;highlighting the innovative research being conducted by graduate students in 38 programs across 5 academic divisions, and featuring a bench of alumni judges&#8212;takes place from 1&#8211;4:30 p.m. at McHenry Library.</p>
<p>That night at 7:30 p.m., distinguished alumnus <b>M. Sanjayan</b> (Ph.D. biology, '97) will deliver the alumni keynote address, <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2691">"True Originals: A New Wild: Saving Nature in a Human-Dominated World."</a></b> Sanjayan, executive vice president and senior scientist for Conservation International and host of new PBS series <i>EARTH A New Wild,</i> will share stories and images from his global quest to explore what it means to save nature in a world where wildness no longer exists. Looking beyond the expected devastation of human activity wrought on the natural world, Sanjayan found places&#8212;most at the frontiers of where people and wildlife meet&#8212;where people can help nature thrive.</p>
<p>During the event, Sanjayan will be presented with the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Achievement award, given annually by the UC Santa Cruz&#160;Alumni Association to honor alumni who have rendered special and outstanding service to UC Santa Cruz or who, by personal achievement, have brought distinction to the university.&#160;</p>
<h3>Saturday schedule</h3>
<p>While there will be some familiar faces and events at this year's Alumni Weekend, expect some brand-new twists, too. This year, little Banana Slugs will have a place to mingle and play, with a <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2816">Banana Slug Kid Zone</a></b> event that will take place on Saturday, April 25, from 10 a.m.&#8211;4 p.m. on the Founder's Glen Lawn.</p>
<p>Another new event this year is <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2819">Story Quarry,</a></b> where revelers, starting at 11 a.m., can document their stories and experiences from the beloved and historic UC Santa Cruz Quarry Amphitheater. Reopening the Quarry Amphitheater is among the priorities of <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/">The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>.</p>
<p>Cinephiles should take care not to miss an unusual opportunity: "<b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2818">True Originals: 50 Years of American Film Comedies,"</a> </b>in which distinguished alumnus Ron Yerxa (Grad Division '74) will have an <span>upbeat conversation with the <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel'</em>s Wallace Baine</span>. The two will discuss comedies over the past 50 years that provide an escape from the ordeal of American life and those that embrace our social conditions head-on.&#160;The event is 11 a.m.&#8211;12:30 p.m. at the Humanities Lecture Hall.</p>
<p>All these non-stop exciting events are bound to make people hungry. The <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2822">Banana Slug Lunch: Farm Fresh, Family Style</a></b> will be held from 12:30- 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, April 25, at the Cowell Courtyard. Lunch will be sourced from local farms and served family style. This event will have a whole different look and feel this year because of the strong focus on the past 50 years of memories at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>A group of distinguished speakers will give the past its due at a talk entitled, <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2721">"Tales as Tall as the Redwoods: Reflections on UC Santa Cruz's Founding Years,"</a></b> scheduled for 2&#8211;3:30 p.m. at Stevenson Fireside Lounge.</p>
<p>Expect a capacity crowd at this year's rendition of the always popular <b>Teach Ins,</b> featuring two distinguished UC Santa Cruz faculty members who will give returning Banana Slugs the delicious feeling of getting back into the classroom without the final exams. Professors <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2825">Craig Haney</a></b> and <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2826">Bettina Aptheker</a></b> will give informal, separate talks, both scheduled from 2:30&#8211;3:45 p.m. at Stevenson College.</p>
<p>Haney, a professor of psychology, will give a presentation entitled, <b>"Think Different: Why Everything We've Been Taught About Crime is Wrong and What We Need to Do About It." </b>Stevenson, Room 175. Professor Haney will describe the political and media misrepresentations of the nature and causes of crime in our society and their consequences in help ing to fuel what he describes as "a very expensive and misguided set of crime-control policies over the last several decades."</p>
<p>Bettina Aptheker, distinguished professor and UC Presidential Co-Chair of feminist critical race and ethnic studies, will discuss <b>"Feminism and Social Justice."</b> Her talk is set for Stevenson, Room 150.</p>
<p>Aptheker's research covers such issues as feminist oral history and memoir, feminist pedagogy, African American feminist history, sexuality/queer studies, and Jewish studies.</p>
<p>She hopes the Teach In is a chance to say hello to former students and reach out to people she has never met before, "and are not familiar with the work, not only mine, personally, but also feminist studies. It is such a vibrant department, and it feels great to spread the word about it."</p>
<p>Also on Saturday, April 25, the highly anticipated <b>True Originals</b> series continues with <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2820">"Money, Politics, Climate Change and the Law: Will We Rise to the Challenge?"</a></b> at 11 a.m&#8211;12: 30 p.m. at the Stevenson Fireside Lounge and featuring Judge Kelvin Filer (Stevenson '77), Los Angeles Superior Court in Compton; Judge Alan J. Goodman (Stevenson '67), Los Angeles Superior Court; Judge Teri Jackson (Stevenson '77), San Francisco Superior Court; Troy Smith, Los Angeles Legal Aid (invited); and Zach Wasserman (Merrill '69), public interest lawyer in Oakland. The moderator is Paul Hall (Merrill '72), partner, DLA Piper's litigation practice, San Francisco.</p>
<p>The True Originals series continues that day with two concurrent talks. One of them should be of interest to any budding, seasoned, or wellestablished creative writer. It is <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2773">titled "The Santa Cruz Stairway&#8212;Today's Writing and Publishing Strategies from Fiction to Memoir to Handmade Books,"</a></b> 2:30&#8211;4 p.m., Saturday, April 25, at McHenry Library, Room 4285.</p>
<p>A second True Originals talk&#8212; also set for 2:30&#8211;4 p.m.&#8212;will give participants a strong sense of the art world with a presentation entitled, <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2693">"From Here to Modernity: Perspectives from Distinguished Museum Professionals,"</a></b> set to take place at DARC Room 230.</p>
<p>Those who would like to recharge and unwind in between all these button-pushing dialogues and presentations will have many chances to do so. The <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2830">Sunset and Wine</a></b> alumni wine reception will run from 4&#8211;6 p.m. in the Cowell Courtyard, and the appealing <b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2831">Bonfire by the Bay</a></b> should be nice and toasty from 6&#8211;8 p.m. at the East Field Volleyball Court.</p>
<p>This gathering will be the perfect way to end the day, with stunning views of Monterey Bay, s'mores galore, food trucks, and old friends.</p>
<p>Festivities continue Sunday with brunches, tours, the annual Dizikes Concert, and other events.</p>
<p>All these activities will add up to an unforgettable experience beneath the redwoods as returning Banana Slugs reflect on the past, the present, and the next 50 years.</p>

The University Archives, in particular, are overflowing with materials related to the history of UC Santa Cruz. <br/><br/>If you want to take a trip back in time, check out our original copy of the "Invitation to the University of California from Santa Cruz," a bound volume produced in the late 1950s by the Greater Santa Cruz Chamber of Commerce. A classic puff piece, it sings the praises of the area, complete with color photos of the coastline and surf, highways, and the Cowell Ranch property itself.<br/><br/>I'm delighted that more than 7,000 photos related to campus history have gone online in the past 18 months&#8212;a small fraction of more than 200,000 slides and negatives in our holdings, but an impressive start. <br/><br/>Our dedicated staff, overseen by Elisabeth Remak-Honnef, head of Special Collections and Archives, is constantly chipping away at the challenge of processing our collections, making them available to the public and bringing them online. For them, it's truly a labor of love. They even hosted a tea-and-cookies get-together recently to enlist the help of retired staff and emeriti faculty in identifying people in more than 700 campus photos. <br/><br/>Archival staff have just finished processing the papers of botanist Jean Langenheim, the first woman scientist hired by UCSC. Personal archives like Langenheim's are filled with biographical treasures, as well as professional materials. In her case, the contents include a fragile scrapbook from her childhood with her own hand-drawn sketches of flowers&#8212;as well as black-and-white photos from 1953 of Langenheim wielding a machete during field research in Colombia.<br/><br/>Countless colorful stories are hidden away in the archives. Our campus history collection includes 150 boxes of ephemera, one of which holds the diploma refused by a student who disrupted the campus's first commencement ceremony. Other boxes hold the syllabus from the first class offered at UCSC, punch cards used by students in the 1970s to register for classes, and posters promoting plays, concerts, and performances on campus throughout the decades.<br/><br/>A real gem linked to the University Archives is the collection of oral histories we've produced. These collaborations capture priceless memories, stories, and perspectives&#8212;and whenever possible, audio recordings, as well. Under the direction of Senior Editor Irene Reti, recent additions to our collection include the oral histories of Oakes College Provost Herman Blake and Chancellor Emerita MRC Greenwood. <br/><br/>With so many materials to process, we're fortunate to be able to enlist the help of graduate students with subject-area expertise, who in turn get practical training outside their own fields. Next year, through the Center for Archival Research and Training (CART), our focus will be on the Lick Observatory archive and the papers of Professor Emeritus of Natural History Ken Norris. <br/><br/>If this has piqued your curiosity, I hope you'll stop by Special Collections and dip in. Not sure what you're after? All you have to do is come in and say, "I want to see something great." No doubt, you will.<br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="04796106807270172dad58220095cc04"><name>science-internships</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz professor aims to expand science internships for high school students</title><summary>Astronomer Puragra GuhaThakurta will use a sabbatical at Google to expand and diversify the Science Internship Program.</summary><keywords>Puragra GuhaThakurta, Raja GuhaThakurta, SIP, Science Internship Program </keywords><start-date>1425970800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz professor aims to expand science internships for high school students</display-name><path>/2015/03/science-internships</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/science-internships</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1426004205788</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1426527715728</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/bestraja.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/bestraja.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bestraja.jpg</name><display-name>bestraja.jpg</display-name><file-size>40355</file-size><width>300</width><height>199</height></image><image-alt>Raja GuhaThakurta</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/bestraja-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/bestraja-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bestraja-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>bestraja-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24932</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Raja GuhaThakurta</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Raja GuhaThakurta started the Science Internship Program for high school students at UC Santa Cruz in 2009.

The program has grown rapidly at UC Santa Cruz and now involves faculty across campus in a wide range of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields, who have worked with students from 46 different high schools.</p>
<p>Now, GuhaThakurta wants to expand the program beyond UC Santa Cruz and engage a more diverse group of high school students. He will be spending the next eight months on sabbatical at Google in Mountain View, CA, working with University Relations and Engineering Education teams to expand and diversify the Science Internship Program (SIP) to serve high school students throughout the country.</p>
<p>"The hallmark of SIP is it embeds high-school students in real computation-based STEM research projects. Strong mentoring by university researchers--graduate students, postdocs, research staff, and faculty--has been a key reason for the program's success," GuhaThakurta said.</p>
<p>To date, about 60 percent of the participants in the program have been female students, he said. Of the nearly 100 SIP alumni who have decided on college majors, more than half have opted for computer science.</p>
<p>By working with the University Relations team at Google, which has ties to many research universities, GuhaThakurta hopes to replicate the UC Santa Cruz framework at other sites. At the same time, he is looking to diversify the program through a greater emphasis on students from groups that are underrepresented in the STEM fields.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Building connections</strong></p>
<p>GuhaThakurta has already begun building connections between SIP and other programs for high-school students, such as the UC-wide <a href="https://cosmos-ucop.ucdavis.edu/">COSMOS</a> program (California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science). His host at Google will be Ira Pramanick, a software engineer who started a non-profit organization called <a href="http://getmagic.org/index.html">More Active Girls In Computing (MAGIC)</a>, which provides mentoring to middle and high school girls. Other collaborators include Cameron Fadjo, project faculty lead for <a href="http://www.engage-csedu.org/">EngageCSEdu</a>, one of several programs developed at Google that focus on diversity and STEM education.</p>
<p>GuhaThakurta noted that MAGIC and COSMOS have been effective in attracting underrepresented high-school students. By expanding SIP, he wants to increase the opportunities for such students to get hands-on experience doing independent research projects. Programs such as MAGIC and COSMOS could serve as crucial stepping stones, preparing students to take on the challenges of an independent project.</p>
<p>"Most SIP interns to date have been generally well prepared to take on the many new challenges associated with leading an open-ended, independent STEM project. To use an analogy, they are good swimmers so it is fine to throw them into the deep end of the pool," GuhaThakurta said. "As we expand the program, we have to ensure that all students have the preparation and support they need to be successful."</p>
<p>In the summer of 2015, GuhaThakurta plans to increase the number of SIP program centers to four, leading to a 50 percent increase in the number of students reached during this pilot expansion. The UC Santa Cruz program has been operating at full capacity for the past two years, GuhaThakurta noted, and this new expansion plan will put SIP on track to reach over 1,000 new high school students at universities throughout the country by 2020.</p>
<p>"It is a matter of getting other researchers to see the value of including motivated local high-school students in their research, and then providing a framework for student participation and examples of projects that have worked well in the past," GuhaThakurta said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/10/siemens-finalists.html</url><title>UCSC

series of public lectures by eminent scholars and artists to explore the fundamentals of why and how we make and hear music.</p>
<p>Eight guest speakers will be featured from a variety of disciplines, including music, music cognition, biology and language.</p>
<p>Running from April 6 through May 27, the lectures will take place from 5 p.m. to 6:45 p.m. at the Media Theater on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</p>
<p>Admission is free, and the public is invited.</p>
<p>Titled <i>Music, Language, Mind, Evolution</i>, the 2015 series is curated by music professor Larry Polansky. He explained how he came up with the idea for this year&#8217;s series.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a composer, theorist--and well, as someone who thinks a great deal about music--I wanted to broaden the scope to include the various perspectives of thinking about music and sonic communication,&#8221; said Polansky. &#8220;It seems to me that there are a number of questions about music that have to be asked in reference to biology, cognition, and evolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very important way to think about music, kind of &#8216;from scratch,&#8217; trying not to privilege conventions of style, particular cultures, what people &#8216;think music is&#8217; or should be--just keeping a very open mind and asking quite simply, &#8216;What is music?&#8217;"</p>
<p>"To me, and to others, that question evokes cognition, evolution, and some consideration of the relationship to language.&#8221;</p>
<p>The series begins on April 6 with <b>Carol Padden</b>, a Deaf studies scholar and sign language researcher, who is also a 2010 MacArthur Fellow and Dean of Social Sciences at UC San Diego.</p>
<p>Other guests include <b>Katy Payne</b>, an acoustic biologist, founder of the <i>Elephant Listening Project</i>, and a whale song expert; <b>Thalia Wheatley</b>, a cognitive scientist in the emerging field of &#8220;emotion&#8221;; and acclaimed American composer <b>Christian Wolff</b>.</p>
<p>The lineup also includes <b>Rex Cocroft</b>, a groundbreaking researcher in insect and plant intelligence; and <b>Douglas Repetto</b>, a composer, bio-artist, and founder of the &#8220;DorkBot&#8221; movement, which has made him an international celebrity in experimental arts.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two very important and highly experimental musicians, two cognitive scientists who are making important strides in very new ways, two animal communication scholars, and two great thinkers about language,&#8221; noted Polansky.</p>
<p>&#8220;The level of brilliance, creativity and impact of this group is extraordinary.&#8221;</p>
<p>This series is sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division, the Arts Dean&#8217;s Fund for Excellence, and US Bank.</p>

The LHC's first run produced the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/07/higgs-boson.html">breakthrough discovery of the Higgs boson</a> in 2012. After shutting down for planned maintenance in early 2013, the LHC is now ready to explore new realms of particle physics over the next three years.</p>
<p>"The most exciting thing is that we'll be probing a new energy scale in the upcoming run. It's an opportunity to see what nature is like at these higher energies," said Howard Haber, professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In addition to studying the Higgs boson with much greater precision, physicists will be looking for evidence of new physics beyond the "standard model," which describes all the known subatomic particles. Some theories, such as supersymmetry, predict the existence of exotic particles that should appear in high-energy collisions at the LHC. Another possibility is the discovery of extra dimensions beyond the familiar four dimensions of space time. Physicists could also identify the mysterious dark matter that makes up most of the mass in the universe. Dark matter candidates arise frequently in theories of physics beyond the standard model, including supersymmetry and extra dimensions.</p>
<p>"Dark matter stands out to me as the most interesting missing element at this time, and this next step in energy may provide what's needed to find it," said professor of physics Abe Seiden. "And, of course, we just might find something nobody's thought about."</p>
<p><strong>World leader</strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz physicists have been at the forefront of U.S. participation in the LHC from the start. The <a href="http://scipp.ucsc.edu/">Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics</a> (SCIPP) is recognized as a world leader in the development of custom electronics and silicon sensors for state-of-the-art particle detection systems, and SCIPP physicists have been working on ATLAS, the largest of two general purpose detectors at the LHC, since 1994. Seiden led a team from 11 U.S. institutions that developed a new detector component for ATLAS called the Insertable b Layer (IBL). Installed in spring 2014, the IBL will be instrumental in tagging and identifying particles during the second run of the LHC.</p>
<p>ATLAS has multiple layers of devices to track and measure the jets of subatomic particles generated by high-energy collisions of proton beams within the LHC. The IBL is now the innermost layer, placing sensors closer to the collisions than ever before. "It's going to be the first thing the particles hit, so it provides critical measurements for determining where the particles are coming from," Seiden said.</p>
<p>"The IBL allows us to look at the particles coming out with higher precision, giving us greater sensitivity to find evidence of new physics," added UCSC physicist Jason Nielsen.</p>
<p>Seiden is currently managing U.S. research and development efforts for a large-scale ATLAS upgrade planned for future runs in the 2020s. Meanwhile, SCIPP physicists at CERN--the European particle physics lab in Geneva, Switzerland, where the LHC is located--have been working around the clock to get ATLAS ready for Run 2. "They're the ones who get called in the middle of the night. ATLAS was torn apart for two years for the upgrade, so they've been working on the integration and commissioning of the new components," Nielsen said.</p>
<p><strong>Higher energy</strong></p>
<p>The most dramatic change at the LHC is that the energy of the collisions will be almost doubled, reaching 13 TeV (tera electron volts) in 2015 compared to 8 TeV in 2012. The "luminosity" or intensity of the beams will also be higher, producing more collisions per second. The combination of increased energy and luminosity will mean a huge increase in the amount of data produced, giving more statistical power to the analyses. In addition, the higher-energy collisions could produce new particles and phenomena that have never been seen before.</p>
<p>The potential for discovering extra dimensions is particularly exciting to UC Santa Cruz physicist Stefano Profumo, whose theoretical papers have helped set the stage for the search for extra dimensions and dark matter at the LHC. A dark matter candidate emerges naturally from a relatively simple model of extra dimensions. Profumo and his colleagues analyzed this model, taking into account the mass of the newly discovered Higgs boson and cosmological measurements of the abundance of dark matter in the universe. Their calculations yield predictions for the mass of the dark matter particle and how it could be detected at the LHC.</p>
<p>"The LHC won't directly see dark matter. The evidence would be a lot of missing energy and two jets of particles, with characteristic features," Profumo said. If this model of extra dimensions is correct, dark matter particles would not have been seen during the first run, but should be detected at the higher energies of Run 2, he noted.</p>
<p>"If nature looks like this, we are bound to see something by the end of Run 2. That's what keeps me on the edge of my chair," Profumo said.</p>
<p>Supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and a variety of other ideas have been developed to address fundamental questions that the standard model left unanswered. "We're desperately searching for some new phenomenon that is going to indicate an enhancement to the standard model," Haber said. "I've worked on supersymmetry, so it would be great if that turns out to be right. But give me anything, any evidence of physics beyond the standard model, and then we'll figure out what it is."</p>
<p><strong>Higgs boson</strong></p>
<p>According to Haber, another important task for the LHC's second run is to learn more about the Higgs boson, which he said is unlike any other elementary particle. "The first run gave us a crude picture of what it is and its properties, but we would like to characterize it much more accurately," Haber said, noting that the souped up LHC will be able to produce ten times as many Higgs bosons as it did during the first run.</p>
<p>"We just scratched the surface in the first run, and most of the LHC horizon is open in front of us," he said. "There are some cynics who say the Higgs boson is the end of the story&#8212;there's been no hint of any new physics, so they're already getting frustrated. My answer is, give me a break&#8212;the LHC has so far only run at half the design energy and one-tenth the design luminosity at best. We're just getting started here."</p>
<p>As the LHC ramps up for its second run, the first proton beam is scheduled to circulate through the collider's 27-kilometer ring of superconducting magnets on March 23. The first collisions are expected to take place in late May or early June.</p>
<p>The international LHC collaboration involves about 10,000 scientists from 113 countries, including 1,700 scientists, students, and technicians from 96 U.S. institutions. At UC Santa Cruz, the project involves about ten faculty and senior scientists, a dozen postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, and about ten undergraduates working on various aspects of SCIPP's contributions.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0a0444fd807270172dad5822ade11283"><name>community-bulletin-lewd-conduct</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Crime Bulletin - Lewd Conduct at Stevenson College</title><summary>Several female students have reported to university officials that they have been sexually harassed and/or asked to engage in unwelcomed sexual activity by a male student. </summary><start-date>1425970800000</start-date><display-name>Community Crime Bulletin - Lewd Conduct at Stevenson College</display-name><path>/2015/03/community-bulletin-lewd-conduct</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/community-bulletin-lewd-conduct</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1426097194192</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1426097194192</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>Several female students have reported to university officials that they have been sexually harassed and/or asked to engage in unwelcomed sexual activity by a male student.

As most of you know, the week involved four days of student protest that took various forms, from rallies and marches to blockages of roads.&#160; <br/> <br/> Six of our students were arrested for blocking Highway 17 for several hours. Community outrage has been acute; more than 4,200 people have signed an online petition calling for the expulsion of any students planning or participating in similar actions, and letters and comments in local media have been sharply critical. Since then, we have also received demands that the students involved should be held immune from discipline because their conduct occurred off-campus.&#160; <br/> <br/> Federal law prohibits discussion of any individual student disciplinary matter, and, of course, the outcome of any student conduct matter cannot be determined until all have had a fair opportunity to be heard.&#160; However, it is imperative that we correct some general misimpressions about our student code of conduct. <br/> <br/> Off-campus conduct does not enjoy immunity from discipline. In fact, our Code of Student Conduct (Section 101.10(h)) specifically covers off-campus &#8220;conduct which egregiously and/or repeatedly has negatively impacted members of the surrounding off-campus community and which violates federal, state or local law/ordinances; or conduct which severely impacts or strains emergency response abilities in the surrounding community.&#8221;&#160; Upon accepting admission to the university, students agree to abide by the student code of conduct and meet the expectations of respectful behavior.<br/> <br/> Clearly, blocking a main highway would negatively impact our surrounding community; traffic was disrupted throughout the area, and the blockage placed a heavy burden on emergency services to deal both with the blockage as well as traffic diversion. In the judgment of the county district attorney, the blockage also constituted a violation of law and criminal charges related to these incidents are being pursued.<br/> <br/> We have also received concerns about the due process rights of the students involved in the blockage of Highway 17. Student disciplinary proceedings are governed by significant guarantees of due process and must provide a full and fair opportunity for students to be heard. This is our standard in all student conduct matters. The right to a fair process, however, does not equate with the absence of disciplinary action, and it would be misleading to conflate the two.&#160; <br/> <br/> Other protest activity has also come to our attention. On Wednesday, protesters established on-campus &#8220;checkpoints&#8221; to illustrate concerns about the Israel-Palestine conflict. Students were physically blocked from entering specific doorways unless they produced identification. While we worked to ensure that alternate avenues of entry were available to students who wished to avoid these protests, some students felt particularly targeted, and hate/bias reports resulting from this aspect of the protest are under review.&#160; <br/> <br/> Finally, on Thursday, protesters blocked two points on campus (the Hagar/Coolidge intersection and the West Entrance), preventing people from moving freely onto and off the campus. These blockades were established early, and we determined that for safety reasons we could not ask our employees to attempt to gain entry to the campus. As a consequence, students were unable to access the classes that they pay to attend. Faculty and graduate students could not get to their offices, laboratories, and studios, and people who live on campus could not get to jobs, medical appointments, and childcare. Important campus services such as dining, OPERS, libraries, and the health center were either closed or suffered dramatically limited access. This does not include the financial costs to the campus&#8212;the salaries paid for people who could not work, the contractors who could not make deliveries, and additional emergency services that were needed.&#160; <br/> <br/> Ironically, what was lost during this week was the very real issue of tuition increases, an option that UC has proposed in the face of waning state support that does not match the mandatory costs we incur. UC Santa Cruz faces a $7 million deficit in the coming academic year; the proposed tuition increase would alleviate only $4 million of that. If enacted, the tuition hike would mostly affect our middle-income students and their families. <br/> <br/> The tactics used by protesters, however, overshadowed this exceptionally important issue of tuition levels. Far from amplifying the important political dialogue regarding UC tuition, these protests created a narrative that was overwhelmingly about the disruptive impact of the protests themselves. This is more than just a missed opportunity. It is a shame.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="145b8320807270172dad5822fe964101"><name>rev-spring-15-family-ties</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Family ties </title><summary>When family members have the experience of attending UC Santa Cruz in common, they've walked the same paths—contributing to a sense of pride, connection, and shared values.</summary><keywords>Weber, Salaz, Ruiz, Alastra, Max Levin</keywords><start-date>1428303600000</start-date><display-name>Family ties </display-name><path>/2015/03/rev-spring-15-family-ties</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/rev-spring-15-family-ties</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1426270683888</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1428354664155</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Amy Ettinger</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/ruiz-jerry.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/ruiz-jerry.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ruiz-jerry.jpg</name><display-name>ruiz-jerry.jpg</display-name><file-size>6298</file-size><width>120</width><height>171</height></image><image-alt>Jerry Ruiz (Crown '77, economics) was the first member of his family to go to college, ins</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/weber-salaz-family-members-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/weber-salaz-family-members-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>weber-salaz-family-members-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>weber-salaz-family-members-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24652</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alums Bob and Madeline Rose Ann met as students at UC Santa Cruz; both have parents who ar</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jerry Ruiz (Crown '77, economics) was the first member of his family to go to college, inspiring his four younger brothers, who also attended UC Santa Cruz.

His parents never went to high school, but Ruiz was a stellar student and earned excellent grades.</p>
<p>However, it wasn't until an educational opportunities coordinator from UC Santa Cruz reached out to him that his dream of going to college became a reality.</p>
<p>Ruiz (Crown '77, economics) is now a successful lawyer in Los Angeles. As the first member of his family to go to college, he inspired his four younger brothers, who also attended UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The Ruiz brothers' story illustrates what educational studies have suggested over the years; when a sibling goes off to college, or a parent returns to school later in life, this act of ambition and bravery will encourage others in the family to follow their example.</p>
<p>But it's more than just a question of inspiring and emboldening family members to attend the same university. Family ties also make a college career a smoother and more comfortable ride&#8212;even for insecure first-year students&#8212;while increasing pride, connection, and a strong sense of shared values.</p>
<p>In its 50 years, UC Santa Cruz has inspired many family members to share the experience of attending&#8212;then becoming proud alumni. We tell some of their stories here.</p>
<h3>Paving the way</h3>
<p>"My mother was very good at reinforcing the idea that education was very important," said Ruiz. "When we were young we had no excuse not to get out of bed and go to school."</p>
<p>Roberto Rubalcava, then-director of UC Santa Cruz's Educational Opportunity Program, reached out to Ruiz and recruited him.</p>
<p>When he arrived at UC Santa Cruz, Ruiz immediately felt like he was part of a community. He found a close circle of friends and helped to establish a Latino-themed dorm on campus.</p>
<p>Ruiz now mentors youth from underserved communities and directs them toward college careers, attends the campus's Multicultural Career Conference, and serves on the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Council, which supports student scholarships.</p>
<p>He said that Latino families embrace that spirit of the "pioneer student" who sets a good example for his brothers and sisters and paves the way for them.</p>
<p>"Convincing the first in the family to go far from home is the hardest sell," said Ruiz. "Once the first one goes, the rest of the family usually follows."</p>
<p>The same principle held true for Freddy Ruiz (Crown '80, psychology), who felt safe and secure about attending UC Santa Cruz because his brother was a senior there while he was an incoming first-year student. A large circle of mentors and friends awaited him when he arrived.</p>
<p>"Jerry was the flight lead," said Freddy Ruiz, a former Air Force Judge Advocate Officer. "I was just a kid. He was a smart guy, and I knew he'd picked a school where we were going to do great."</p>
<p>Freddy Ruiz is now a lawyer in San Antonio, but he still spends several weeks a year in Santa Cruz, and is encouraging his stepdaughter to apply to UC Santa Cruz next year.</p>
<p>"I wish everyone in life had a chance to go to school in Santa Cruz," said Freddy Ruiz. "They'd never regret it."</p>
<h3>All in the family</h3>
<p>Naomi Salaz (Crown '81, education) was also inspired by a family member to attend UC Santa Cruz. But it was her father, Richard Salaz (Merrill '72, community studies), who came to UC Santa Cruz as an older adult with five children. The same EOP director who inspired Ruiz to come to the school recruited him.</p>
<p>"My dad was the oldest student at the time with the most kids," said Salaz.</p>
<p>Richard Salaz attended a junior college in Colorado before he got married. He studied in Mexico City for two years. Then he came back to the United States and had five kids. He decided to move out to California.</p>
<p>"He moved out here to California because there were so many opportunities for work," said Naomi Salaz. "But when he got out here, he was working in a factory and he wasn't happy at all."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz opened up a different world, exposing him to an intellectual environment and the wild creativity of the bohemian and "hippie" culture of the late '60s and early '70s.</p>
<p>"Dad said the reason he went back to school was to be a role model for his kids, to show that it was never too late to get an education," Naomi Salaz said. "He also wanted to expose us to campus life."</p>
<p>She lived in the dorms at Crown for all five years of her college career, graduated, and went on to become an elementary school teacher in Salinas.</p>
<p>But she was not the only one to follow her father. Both of Naomi's sisters also attended UC Santa Cruz. Her sister Rose Ann met her future husband Bob Weber (Crown '84, biology) in the dorms of Crown College.</p>
<p>"It was really meant to be," Weber said. "We were from such different backgrounds and probably wouldn't have met anywhere else."</p>
<p>Weber himself is a fount of "all in the family" stories about UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>His father worked for the State Department, so the family travelled abroad when he was younger. He didn't know much about schools in the United States, so he followed in the footsteps of his older brother, Jon, who received his Ph.D in chemistry from UC Santa Cruz. His three younger sisters, Ann, Catherine, and Elisabeth, also graduated from UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>But the family connections don't stop there. His sister Catherine was married to another alum on campus. After seeing the rich educational opportunities at her children's school, Weber's mom, Barbara, was also inspired to attend UC Santa Cruz after Weber's father retired from the State Department.</p>
<p>"I think we all really believed in the educational philosophy of UC Santa Cruz," said Weber, now a doctor in Watsonville.</p>
<p>In total, at least a dozen of Weber's family members have attended UC Santa Cruz. His daughter, Marie, will be getting married on campus in September.</p>
<p>The third generation of Webers and Salazes now has alumni ties to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Weber's daughter, Stephanie (Crown '14, electrical engineering), said she felt her family's connection to the university was something very special.</p>
<p>"It was pretty neat being in a dorm right across the quad from the dorm where my parents met," she said.</p>

<h3>Deep connection</h3>
<p>Sometimes the connection to campus goes even deeper. Max Levin, father of Deborah Alastra (Porter '83, fine arts), was a founder of Crown College. He served as the senior preceptor at Crown and was a faculty member in the psychology department until his retirement in 1981. Her mother, Dorothy Levin, was a counselor at Porter for many years.</p>
<p>Alastra attended a small alternative high school in England for her senior year of high school. The only college she applied to was UC Santa Cruz. She was accepted, started her studies at Cowell, and, like her father, left a mark on campus. She helped build the original A-frame at the college and worked on the stained-glass window at the Cowell Library. She took a break from school and returned when she was 26 to Porter College. Now she is a children's book illustrator in Oakland.</p>
<p>Alastra's niece, Naomi Andrews (Cowell '88, history), decided to attend UC Santa Cruz because her grandparents lived in Santa Cruz. She received her Ph.D in history from UC Santa Cruz and is now an associate professor of history at Santa Clara University.</p>
<p>When she was at UC Santa Cruz, the campus was small but growing quickly. The faculty were part of a tightly knit group that didn't change much over the years. She lived in one half of a duplex, and her aunt, Deborah, lived in the other half. "She was more like a much older sister," Andrews said.</p>
<p>Andrews's younger brother, Josh, attended UC Santa Cruz and had some of the same professors as his sister.</p>
<p>"I grew up spending a lot of time in Santa Cruz," said Josh Andrews (Stevenson '97, history). "My sister started grad school when I was a freshman. It was good for me to be where my family was." Josh Andrews is now a lawyer at Uber, the San Francisco-based rideshare and taxiservice company.</p>
<p>The Andrews's cousin, Samuel Levin (College Eight '08, health sciences), said Santa Cruz attracted him because three generations of his family lived there&#8212; people he didn't get to see often growing up. It was also the most desirable school for him with a strong reputation in the sciences. He was thrilled when one of his human physiology professors spoke fondly of his grandfather.</p>
<p>Besides, turning UC Santa Cruz into a family affair made it comfortable right from the beginning.</p>
<p>"It was nice to have familiar faces in a new city after leaving home," said Levin. "I am proud to be a graduate of the same university where my family attended and worked. Seeing their lives and their work, success, and lifestyle make me proud to be a part of the same education they had."</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz was a place of the mind in 1965, and, to a large degree, a place still in the mind; so much of what we now know as the college campus did not exist yet.</p>
<p>But the spirit of adventure, and the willingness to follow an ever-changing road map, united UC Santa Cruz's very first graduating class and the faculty and staff members who helped guide their way to graduation. The founding vision of UC Santa Cruz was grounded in a solid liberal arts education with a multidisciplinary focus. It was also centered around small residential colleges, as well as faculty members who prided themselves on their ability to challenge the young students while taking their ideas seriously.</p>
<p>This winter, <em>UC Santa Cruz Review</em> set up a "roundtable" of voices from the past and present to reflect on the campus turning 50 years old in 2015. They talked about the many changes they've witnessed, and the ways the place has stayed true to its multidisciplinary and idealistic original vision.</p>
<p><em>The following is a combination of several in-depth phone interviews with the subjects. Dan White's questions are in bold.&#160;</em></p>
<p>Our roundtablers include:</p>
<p>&#8226; Economics professor <strong>David Kaun,</strong> a faculty member since 1966</p>
<p>&#8226;&#160;Pioneer students <strong>Jock Reynolds</strong> (Stevenson '69, psychology), a renowned artist and museum director; <strong>Michael Gerber</strong> (Cowell '69, economics), a professor in UC Santa Barbara's Graduate School of Education, and his wife, <strong>Kathy Gerber</strong> (Stevenson '69, psychology), a retired teacher (the two met while working together on UC Santa Cruz's first ever yearbook); and <strong>Meg Zweiback</strong> (Merrill '69, politics), a pediatric nurse practitioner and author</p>
<p>&#8226; Staff members <strong>Katherine Beiers,</strong> a retired UC Santa Cruz librarian who worked at McHenry Library from 1967 to 1992; and retired housing administrator <strong>Jerry Walters</strong></p>
<h3>Breaking ground</h3>
<p><strong>There was a strong sense of breaking new ground, not just on the physical campus but also in the classrooms.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Gerber:</strong> It was like living in a forest. It was a beautiful setting and there was no history. Now the campus has institutional traditions you learn about, and there are also upperclassmen. Your behavior as a first-year is mapped against what you see other people doing. The university has rules and procedures, but when we got there, there was not much of that. Everything we were in contact with was being created on the spot. Cowell College was established as countercultural, an explicit experiment: How can you have a small liberal arts college embedded in a university? There were some upperclassmen, and about 100 or so transfer juniors, but they didn't live on campus. We generally didn't see them.</p>
<p><strong>It's hard for me to even imagine attending a school with all those earthmovers and a bunch of un-built structures. I think the risk would have been too much for me to handle. I would have thought, "I don't know about this. What if this new campus is going to shut down next week?"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerry Walters:</strong> But I think you're coming at this through today's eyes, and you aren't looking at the situation from the perspective of a 17- or 18-year-old. People were more rugged then. The faculty were young, too. And everybody was in the same situation, all new, all excited, coming to a new experiment.</p>
<p><strong>David Kaun:</strong> When I got here, initially in February of 1966, the physical buildings of Cowell and Stevenson (respectively, the first and second colleges constructed on campus) did not exist. It was exciting. There were 600 students, and we added another 600 with Stevenson. I had an intro course on economics, and we had four students.</p>
<p><strong>Jock Reynolds:</strong> There would be chairs and tables in the Field House and they would empty it out to hold a big World Civilization course, and empty it out again to have a meal, and empty it out again and play basketball. We were making it up as we went along.</p>
<p><strong>Meg Zweiback:</strong> At the end of the year, we had a huge comprehensive exam covering everything over the year from three quarters. Lots of people flunked the test. They hadn't figured out that if you flunked you didn't get credit for 15 units, which meant you were out. I read Bertrand Russell's History of Western Philosophy and crammed in 20 unread books, starting with Plato, in one weekend and passed! UC Santa Cruz was teaching us to think "big picture" and to create themes and to ask questions so if you were (only) a dutiful student and did your work and did not have an inquiring mind you wouldn't do as well.</p>
<p><strong>That's a lot of learning in a small amount of time! Did you retain a lot of what you learned?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meg Zweiback:</strong> Yes, because the professors, including Mary Holmes in art, had a great gift for making you see things you hadn't noticed before. I can still tell you more about medieval architecture than what I learned when I first went to Europe.</p>
<h3>Counterculture revolution</h3>
<p><strong>This was the mid-1960s before the counterculture really caught fire, before the Summer of Love. Often when people think "'60s," they impose this image that started later on.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerry Walters:</strong> Well, let's put it this way. While they may have looked a lot different when they graduated from here, they arrived clean-shaven, with haircuts and nice clothes. Those were such different times. In those days there was this idea of "In Loco Parentis," where the university was thought to be a parent in a way. As an example, our chancellor had students sign in or out so if parents wanted to find their son or daughter, all they had to do was call the preceptor. They would call up and say, "I haven't heard from my son for a while. Where is he?" We were so small, we could get in touch with people quickly. Well, that didn't go over well. A lot of students rebelled after a while. "This is our time, in our lives, and we will keep in touch with our folks (when we want to)."</p>
<p><strong>David Kaun:</strong> Stevenson used to have two sets of dormitories: one quad for men, the other for women. After the first year they realized the quad with four dorms of men turned out to be barbaric, so in the second year they intermingled the dormitories, and by the fourth year students could go into each other's dormitories through the first-floor lounge. Every single year the dormitory policy changed. It was not very long before men and women were living on the same floors. It was difficult for parents to come there. "Wait a minute! There's your room, and there are girls next door?" Not the kind of college their parents went to.</p>
<h3>Larger than life founders</h3>
<p><strong>Maybe it's because of the iconic photos: Page Smith riding a horse through campus, and Chancellor McHenry posing at a desk on an empty field, but I think of the founding figures as larger than life in those days.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katherine Beiers:</strong> When I was going to the University of Southern California, I'd read a two-volume book about John Adams by (the late historian, professor, and founding Cowell College provost) Page Smith, and those were two of the best books I'd ever read. When I moved up to Santa Cruz I had no idea he was here, that he was a professor. One day I was working on a Sunday afternoon and he called to see if we had a certain book. Normally you don't just check the stacks when people call (they, of course, had no computerized inventory of books). But this was Page Smith, so I got him the book. He rode into the big foyer of the library, where the caf&#233; is now. I gave him his book. I checked out the book, and handed to him, and off he went on his horse. I did not make that up.</p>
<h3>Town and gown</h3>
<p><strong>I would imagine that UC Santa Cruz's presence in the sleepy city of Santa Cruz changed the way of life here dramatically by the end of the '60s.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Gerber:</strong> You have to try to imagine Pacific Avenue (Santa Cruz's famous "main drag") as an old-fashioned downtown much like Soledad or Watsonville with a single movie theater, one large department store, and a bunch of small shops, a sleepy place. In 1965 it was sleepy; there wasn't much of a youth culture presence, and all of a sudden there were 500 freshmen roaming through downtown; that changed the place instantly.</p>
<p><strong>It seems to me that the social consciousness that people still associate with UC Santa Cruz&#8212; in part because of students' Peace Corps participation&#8212;was just taking shape then, and had as much to do with the campus's vision as it had to do with the foment of the '60s.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kathy Gerber:</strong> Because I was involved with social sciences, we felt a great need to be involved in making the world a better place to be, and part of the social movement but also exercise our intellectual commitment. We wanted to choose a route in the world that would affect people in the world positively. Part of that was a product of the time, part of that was the social milieu of Santa Cruz, and part of it was the passion of the people we were meeting on campus and in town.</p>
<h3>Original spirit</h3>
<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz has expanded over time. And it's changed in many ways. I know that many founding faculty were upset about the original narrative evaluations becoming supplementary when grades were instituted for all students in 2001. But I was hoping you could reflect on ways that the "original" UC Santa Cruz remains visible or recognizable in the current campus.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jock Reynolds:</strong> I've been back there enough to think the spirit of the place is in many ways very much intact though you don't expect everything to remain in stasis.</p>
<p><strong>And how does your experience at UC Santa Cruz continue to reverberate with you in your life?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jock Reynolds:</strong> I was just thrilled to get into UC Santa Cruz, and I loved every minute of it. During my senior year, they brought a huge number of amazingly important visiting artists. John Cage, Allan Kapro, George Segal, and (international avant-garde art movement member) Robert Watts.</p>
<strong>Meg Zweiback:</strong> My husband and I are 50 years out of college. We both hit 65. Neither of us plans to retire because we do things we enjoy. We're still interested in what we do, and that comes from our education. What UC Santa Cruz did for us&#8212;and this was very deliberate&#8212;was start with these big broad survey courses and then these small seminars that gave us intimate connections with faculty members who cared to probe and explore what we callow children had to say, these brilliant faculty people who thought we were worth investing in.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="14bc9240807270172dad582285cc3d1e"><name>rev-spring-15-alumni-profile-hall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Profile / Rachel Howzell Hall: Writing down the mysteries  </title><summary>Rachel Howzell Hall had always been fascinated by the darkness of crime novels, and, as an English and American literature major at UC Santa Cruz, she'd wanted to pen her own.

But she was too frightened by her lack of knowledge about police work to give it a try.</p>
<p>Then something came along that scared her more than any thriller could.</p>
<p>At 33, and two months pregnant with her first child, Hall was diagnosed with a rare form of breast cancer. She survived and gave birth to a healthy daughter, Maya, now 10.</p>
<p>"After cancer, and knowing what real fear was like, I said, 'Screw this,'" remembered Hall in a telephone interview from the Windsor Hills, Calif., home she shares with her daughter and husband, David. She decided she would buy the Mercedes she'd vowed to own by the time she was 50 and also write her detective story.</p>
<p>"I wanted to do both before I left this world," she said, "and I wasn't guaranteed to be here when I was 50."</p>
<p>Today, the 1992 graduate of Merrill College is author of four books, including the 2014 <em>Land of Shadows,</em> a book Publisher's Weekly called an "exceptional crime novel."</p>
<p>Set against the backdrop of a racially charged Los Angeles, the protagonist of <em>Land of Shadows</em> is a feisty, smart, African American homicide detective named Elouise "Lou" Norton, who prowls a crimeridden part of Los Angeles known as "The Jungle" in search of a murderer who may be responsible for the deaths of two young black girls.</p>
<p>The Jungle is a place Hall knows well. She was raised there amid the nighttime serenade of gunfire, screams, and police helicopters. But Hall's working-class parents were determined she would have a better life, and her childhood was filled with books, piano lessons, and church.</p>
<p>"I kind of lived in two worlds," said Hall. One world was The Jungle and the other was the more privileged sphere of church and school friends who lived in an affluent neighborhood near her own.</p>
<p>It's a backstory she shares with her protagonist Elouise&#8212;that idea that success can have its roots in a bullet- riddled neighborhood, that good exists next to evil, and sometimes it's hard to see the difference at first glance.</p>
<p>"I can't say her books are autobiographical," said her former college roommate and longtime friend Alissa Gardenhire (Merrill '92, environmental studies), who got a doctorate in urban planning from Harvard. "But I think her novels reflect her own personality, and I think she is, like a lot of writers, a student of humanity. She's an observer of people."</p>
<p>As one of a few African American mystery writers, and with a black female detective for a main character, Hall said she makes it a point to be an observer&#8212;and also a tenacious researcher. Her novels are born out of lengthy interviews with law enforcement officers, and long sessions at mystery-writing conferences, while her time at UC Santa Cruz exposed her to a wide variety of viewpoints and literature.</p>
<p>"It awakened my creativity," the 44-year-old said of the campus.</p>
<p>Hall writes in longhand on yellow legal pads, snatching time before work as a science proposal writer for City of Hope, a cancer research and treatment facility, and in between her daughter's soccer practices.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, the final draft of her as-yet-unpublished novel <em>Trail of Echoes</em> was stolen from her car, then miraculously returned to her a day later.</p>
<p>"It was a visceral, gut thing," said Hall of the hours when she didn't know her manuscript's location.</p>
<p>But like all good writers, Hall promised, "that experience will somehow get incorporated into a future story."</p>

<p>But as the 36-year-old Martinez dug deeper, hands began to drop. How many had broadband? How many shared their computers with fewer than three people? How many had computers less than five years old?</p>
<p>By the time Martinez (Oakes '04, evolutionary biology) was done, only three of the students&#8212;all of whom resided in the mostly Hispanic farming community of Watsonville, where 20 percent of the population lives below the poverty line&#8212;still had their hands in the air.</p>
<p>"Imagine if these kids had more access," asked Martinez, whose laid-back style belies his drive to change what he sees as a worrisome divide. "What could they create? What would come out of that?"</p>
<p>Martinez's answer was to found Digital NEST, a hip technology learning center in Watsonville designed to help young people from rural areas not only master skills like programming, game design, filmmaking, and graphic arts, but also create their own projects and get a taste of the work world by hiring out to local companies.</p>
<p>"We need young people not just to be literate with technology but to be fluent in it," Martinez said.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, Martinez studied to be a scientist, working in Professor Barry Sinervo's herpetology lab through CAMP (California Alliance for Minority Participation). But Martinez began to feel the pull of community work and soon found himself on the ground floor of an after-school program started by ETR Associates of Scotts Valley that taught tech skills to middleschool- age girls in the Pajaro Valley School District.</p>
<p>That project, which Martinez led, morphed into the award-winning Watsonville TEC, which now serves 15 Pajaro Valley schools.</p>
<p>But Martinez saw the need for more.</p>
<p>On field trips to Apple and Google he witnessed the creative, freeform culture of those companies and thought: Why couldn't low-income, minority students have access to the same thing?</p>
<p>He brought his idea to NextSpace co-founder Jeremy Neuner, who signed on as an advisor, and went to work. Martinez collected grants from organizations like the Packard Foundation and got donations from local agriculture companies like Lakeside Organics and S. Martinelli &amp; Co. Adobe offered free software, and a venture capitalist pledged $100,000 in matching funds.</p>
<p>"In a world increasingly reliant on technology, this seemed like a really important program," said Philip Martinelli of S. Martinelli &amp; Co., whose firm donated $5,000 to the project and who has seen his family-run company become more dependent on technology for juice production and quality control.</p>
<p>It's that economic shift that fuels Martinez, a father of three, in his quest to provide the same opportunities offered to kids from more affluent communities to those who live in low-income, rural areas.</p>
<p>Housed in a former accounting services office, Digital NEST, which stands for Nurturing Entrepreneurial Skills with Technology, is open to those from 12-24. Its brightly lit space is just as Martinez imagined: sleek desks, comfortable couches, a large-screen TV, and even free snacks to fuel long hours of creativity. On arrival, members are handed a laptop loaded with the latest software and invited to take online courses or learn from visiting faculty. Students get help writing resumes and creating their own projects, and can even gain experience by hiring out to small businesses who might need technology help.</p>
<p>At a recent Content Marketing class, students voiced dreams of working for Google, designing a computer game, and writing or producing a Hollywood movie.</p>
<p>"The NEST is going to be a solution for rural communities like (Watsonville): the Fresnos, the Merceds, the Hollisters, and beyond," said Martinez.</p>
<p>"For me, this is a social justice issue," he said. "Here is a community that is economically disconnected from opportunity. And that's troublesome for me."</p>

<p>Now the dynamic duo has pooled their resources to donate a large collection of vintage Marvel comics to the UC Santa Cruz Special Collections and Archives.</p>
<p>The comics come from the so-called "Silver Age" of the art form, from the early 1960s to the early 1970s.</p>
<p>"This is the first superhero-focused collection in the country that has scholarly energy behind it," said Gunderson (College Eight '77, philosophy), an international corporate governance, compliance, and management consultant and attorney.</p>
<p>Gunderson and Coha (Kresge '78, mathematics) first became aware of comic books' strong hold on the popular imagination when they attended two of the earliest Comic- Con conventions in San Diego in the early 1970s and saw attendees dressed as their favorite superheroes. The conference-goers were so enthusiastic, they ended up in the pool wearing their full costumes, Gunderson recalled.</p>
<p>They also saw that comics, once denounced as "junk reading" by concerned parents, were having their moment; certain volumes were becoming cultural treasures. And though they were still in high school, they sensed the artistic as well as the monetary value of these works.</p>
<p>"We saw that comics from the 1930s and 1940s were going for high prices," Gunderson said. "We saw the investment potential and decided to buy as much of the Silver Age comics as we could."</p>
<p>When Gunderson and Coha went off to college the comic books remained behind&#8212;mostly forgotten, lying around in boxes in closets in their parents' homes.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Gunderson decided do something with those old boxes. "I ran across an article about the extraordinary prices these Marvel comics were getting at auction," said Gunderson.</p>
<p>He began to look at those vintage volumes as an "endangered species" that had to be saved and stored properly to protect them from future damage. Gunderson said he never really considered selling his comics to a private collector.</p>
<p>"My goal was to find an institution that would take proper care of them and make them accessible to people," he said. "UC Santa Cruz Special Collections is perfect for both those goals."</p>
<p>Gunderson approached Elisabeth Remak-Honnef, head of Special Collections at UC Santa Cruz, a treasure trove of artifacts, papers, and volumes, including medieval manuscripts. Remak-Honnef was enthusiastic, and so was Gunderson's friend, Coha, who agreed to donate his comic book holdings as well.</p>
<p>"It puts them in a good environment where they'll be well cared for," said Coha, who retired from Intel after 35 years.</p>
<p>The 345 comics the friends have donated so far are worth about $35,000.</p>
<p>These days, comic books are much more fashionable and in the spotlight than they once were, with "graphic novels" winning fans as well as mainstream respectability. Looking back at comics from long ago "shows what was going on from a literary standpoint and how comic books fit into the development of that genre," Coha said.</p>
<p>Student enthusiasm for the collection is overwhelming, Gunderson said. Several students were invited to see some of the collection and meet Coha and Gunderson last spring. Some had their picture taken holding one of the gems&#8212;Vol. 1, No. 15 of Amazing Fantasy, which introduced Spider- Man to the world. That issue was appraised at $10,500 before Gunderson donated it.</p>
<p>"The students were so excited that the comic books were physically there, and that they could touch them," said Gunderson.</p>
<p>The collection is timelier than ever. Marvel is having blockbuster success with films such as the Iron Man trilogy. This summer, <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> brought in $94.3 million during its opening weekend. The art-book publisher Taschen is now selling a lavish Marvel-themed book for $200.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Special Collections is already gearing up for an exhibit from the Gunderson-Coha collection, which opened in February and features the art of Marie Severin, who flourished in the traditionally male-dominated comics industry.</p>
<p>Severin was the primary artist behind Dr. Strange and also worked on The Hulk and Sub-Mariner, among many others.</p>
<p>Gunderson has commissioned a catalogue for the exhibit in the style of a comic book. He is also raising grant money to index the collection and make sure it can be used for research purposes on topics ranging from gender studies to popular culture.</p>
<p>"The comics Peter and I are giving are important from an historical perspective," Gunderson said.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/gunderson-coha1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/gunderson-coha1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gunderson-coha1.jpg</name><display-name>gunderson-coha.jpg</display-name><file-size>12264</file-size><width>295</width><height>128</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title> JIM GUNDERSON AND PETER COHA</title><description>The dynamic duo has pooled their resources to donate a large collection of vintage Marvel comics to the UC Santa Cruz Special Collections and Archives.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="14ee9e9f807270172dad5822513c6eb4"><name>rev-spring-15-alumneye</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumneye  </title><summary>This alumni photo submission feature highlights and celebrates the experiences, travels, and artistic insights of UC Santa Cruz's diverse and fascinating alumni.  </summary><start-date>1426230000000</start-date><display-name>Alumneye  </display-name><path>/2015/03/rev-spring-15-alumneye</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/rev-spring-15-alumneye</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1426280324718</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1426280324718</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/alumneye.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/alumneye.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alumneye.jpg</name><display-name>alumneye.jpg</display-name><file-size>86060</file-size><width>600</width><height>404</height></image><image-alt>Photo by Eric C.

He was experimenting with some photography equipment prototypes he was working on. "This photo is the result of a lot of design-engineering and perfecting of ideas," he said. It represents for him the endless motion of all things even in the still of the night and his nocturnal ways.&#160;</p>

The playful image captures the spirit of adventure founding Chancellor Dean McHenry brought to the job of building a new campus from the ground up. It's the early 1960s, a new campus is being created, yet all he's got to work with is a desk in the middle of a pasture.</p>
<p>As the current chancellor of UC Santa Cruz, I love that photo because it speaks to the boldness of McHenry and the enthusiasm of our first students who arrived from all across the nation when the campus opened in 1965. It speaks to all that future potential&#8212;the un-built buildings, the life-changing seminars and mentors, the discoveries and explorations.</p>
<p>It speaks to the fact that those students and their brave professors had to draft their own blueprint as they went along.</p>
<p>The photo also speaks to the whimsical aspect of UC Santa Cruz&#8212;the part of us that would embrace the Banana Slug as our official mascot in 1986, and, to paraphrase Henry David Thoreau, choose to march to a different drummer.</p>
<p>Fifty years after our opening, the campus remains bold, experimental, and dedicated to advancing knowledge&#8212; without losing our quirky individuality. We have stayed true to our founders' vision, providing immersive hands-on learning experiences in the broader context of pursuing UC's mission of education, public service, and research.</p>
<p>From the beginning, UC Santa Cruz was envisioned as a major research university that would offer students an experience that rivals what small private liberal arts colleges offer. As we enter our second half-century, many things have changed, but not that fundamental truth.</p>
<p>How I wish McHenry were around today to find out about the exoplanets we've discovered, the new fronts we've opened up in the war against cancer, the genomes we've mapped and shared with the world, and the convergences we've nurtured between literature, the arts, and the sciences.</p>
<p><a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend2015/">Alumni Weekend</a> is just around the corner. What better occasion to look back on our founding vision, celebrate our current achievements, and contemplate our future?</p>
<p>I hope you'll join us for the festivities from April 23&#8211;26. Come back to campus, celebrate UC Santa Cruz, and watch the sun set behind the very spot where the chancellor hauled out his desk all those years ago.</p>

<p>In his keynote speech Friday night, Penn State geologist Richard Alley provided a compelling overview of how our society's reliance on fossil fuels for energy is driving climate change, and he described how costly the impacts of global warming will be, in both economic and human terms. Alley also made the case that the technology is available now to make the transition to a sustainable energy system, and that it makes sense economically to do so.</p>
<p>"If you just look at dollars and cents, the economy is still better if we start to wisely reduce our use of fossil fuels," Alley said. "Dealing with it makes us better off&#8211;it gives us a stronger economy and more jobs."</p>
<p>The transition will take time, however, and in the meantime carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels continues to pour into the atmosphere, where it traps heat and warms the planet. The result is a changing climate, but taking action now can still make a big difference, said Daniel Schrag, director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment.</p>
<p>"We can't stop climate change, but we can stop climate change from being truly catastrophic," said Schrag, a panelist in a Saturday afternoon session that focused on the "wicked tradeoffs" that are inevitable in dealing with a warming planet. "There is a big difference between two degrees and four degrees or eight degrees," he said, referring to the increase in global average surface temperature expected under different emissions scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptation and tradeoffs</strong></p>
<p>"Adaptation is now upon us, and it will involve tradeoffs," said moderator Daniel Press, the Griswold Professor of Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz. For example, panelists discussed the growing competition for reduced water supplies, pitting cities against agricultural and environmental needs. That particular conflict has become familiar to Californians as the state enters its fourth year of drought.</p>
<p>"We're already not in the climate we used to have," said panelist Noah Diffenbaugh, a Stanford University climate scientist who earned his Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz. Diffenbaugh noted that drought is not just a result of reduced snow and rainfall. Historically, droughts have occurred when reduced precipitation coincides with unusually warm temperatures, whereas years with low precipitation and normal temperatures have not led to drought conditions. Now, however, consistently warmer temperatures mean that drought will occur whenever precipitation is low, he said.</p>
<p><strong>Coastal resilience</strong></p>
<p>One area in which adaptation to climate change is likely to be especially painful is in coastal areas affected by sea level rise. This was the topic of a panel Saturday morning on "coastal resilience." Panelist Susanne Moser noted that some climate experts have worried that talking about adaptation to climate change may distract the public's attention from the central challenge of mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In her experience, however, confronting the details of what adaptation will require can help people realize the importance of taking steps now to address the causes of climate change.</p>
<p>"Mitigation is so much easier than adaptation," Moser said. "I have found that having those conversations about adaptation actually strengthens people's motivation to address the roots of the problem."</p>
<p>In some coastal regions, communities will be forced to retreat from the coast as a result of rising sea level and increasing damage from storms and flooding. The challenge is convincing owners of coastal properties of the need to plan for managed retreat from the coast.</p>
<p>"We have had no success getting people on the oceanfront to move back," said panelist Rob Young, a coastal geologist at Western Carolina University. Too much effort is currently focused on protecting existing shorelines instead of allowing them to move as they would naturally, he said.</p>
<p><strong>Moveable communities</strong></p>
<p>"Coastal ecosystems are inherently resilient because they are naturally dynamic--they can move in response to sea level rise. The tricky part is to allow them to move while preserving communities," Young said. "This is the crux of the matter: the ecosystems have to move, and they are becoming diminished by efforts to hold them in place. Building marshes out into the bay, doing ecosystem restoration in place, is not a bad thing to do, but it is not a long-term solution. We have to change the map."</p>
<p>According to Young, historical maps of the southeastern United States show that in the past, some coastal communities have either disappeared or moved inland in response to shifting shorelines. "Some of them picked up and moved the whole town," he said. "What's new is the idea of protecting communities in place at public expense."</p>
<p>Part of the problem, Young and others said, is that policies such as disaster relief programs and insurance regulations create a system that protects many property owners from the true costs of building in risk-prone areas of the coast. "We have a system of private gains and externalized costs, so that the federal government pays for rebuilding the infrastructure for rich people's vacation homes," Young said.</p>
<p><strong>Questions of fairness</strong></p>
<p>Many of the panelists touched on issues of fairness and the question of who should bear the costs of adapting to climate change. "We'll have plenty of unmanaged retreat, and it won't be fair," Moser said. "Retreat then becomes a class issue."</p>
<p>Alley noted that, on a global scale, the countries most severely affected by climate change will be the underdeveloped countries that have contributed the least to the problem. Schrag added that climate change is also a matter of "intergenerational equity," because current generations that are enjoying cheap energy from fossil fuels are creating dire problems for future generations.</p>
<p>Turning away from an energy system that has been successful and beneficial in so many ways, however, will not be easy. "The most difficult thing to tell people is that something they like to do has to end. It is no small challenge to communicate effectively the need to change," Moser said.</p>
<p>Developing a new energy system that does not depend on fossil fuels is possible, according to Schrag, but it means rebuilding the energy infrastructure, which will take a long time. It will also require continued development and implementation of alternative energy technologies. Policies such as California's law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (AB 32) are important not because of their impact on carbon emissions, Schrag said, but because they encourage the development and improvement of alternative technologies.</p>
<p>"We need to keep advancing the technologies that are going to be disruptive," he said.</p>
<p>Climate change remains a politically polarizing issue, but there is growing recognition of the need to address the problem, said panelist Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at MIT. "The axis of the debate in this country is shifting from whether there is a problem to how do we deal with it," he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="242e13b4807270172dad5822383d9361"><name>rev-spring-15-editors-note</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Editor's note: A charge in the air </title><summary>"Magical" may be a strong word for a college experience, but it comes up again and again when I talk to UC Santa Cruz alumni of all ages. </summary><start-date>1426489200000</start-date><display-name>Editor's note: A charge in the air </display-name><path>/2015/03/rev-spring-15-editors-note</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/rev-spring-15-editors-note</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1426536141706</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1426536141706</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Jourdonnais</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/jourdonnais-gwen.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/jourdonnais-gwen.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jourdonnais-gwen.jpg</name><display-name>jourdonnais-gwen.jpg</display-name><file-size>8360</file-size><width>148</width><height>184</height></image><image-alt>Gwen Jourdonnais, editor</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/jourdonnais-gwen-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/jourdonnais-gwen-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jourdonnais-gwen-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jourdonnais-gwen-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22687</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Gwen Jourdonnais, editor</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Gwen Jourdonnais, editor (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>They came from all over California and the nation with a hunger and a bottomless thirst for intellectual challenge and adventure.</p>
<p>They showed up to see piles of dirt and earthmovers everywhere. Nearly all the emblematic buildings we associate with UC Santa Cruz were figments in the sketchbooks of architects and planners. All they saw were redwood trees, big meadows, some cows&#8212;and lots of potential.</p>
<p>They were a fearless bunch, that small group of students who showed up when UC Santa Cruz opened its doors in 1965&#8212;if a campus with almost no buildings can be said to have doors!</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz opened years before I was born&#8212;but experiencing its beginning through reading oral histories and talking with some of the original students, faculty, and staff is a fascinating experience. A familiar echo in their stories is about the "magic" of the campus at that time&#8212;an electric charge in the air. It must have had something to do with all those brainwaves in motion, the excitement of something new, the groundbreaking seminars, the demanding but riveting World Civilization core course, and the thrill of having no leaders to follow, except for themselves.</p>
<p>I am glad to report that the magic and electricity are still here&#8212;and new alumni and current students still have similar words about the campus. A few things have changed, for sure. There are, undoubtedly, more buildings now. UC Santa Cruz alumni have had a chance to change the world, whether they are helming art museums, blasting into space, developing apps, transforming Hollywood, breaking big news stories, making better communities, or setting the literary world on fire.</p>
<p>"Magical" may be a strong word for a college experience&#8212;especially if you remember the challenges of roommate dynamics, dorm food, and final exams&#8212;but it comes up again and again when I talk to UC Santa Cruz alumni of all ages. And I can see why&#8212;walking through campus, you can feel the electricity even now.</p>
<p>I hope you come to <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend2015/">Alumni Weekend</a> for the big 50th celebration April 23&#8211;26 and feel it again for yourself. Walk the trails and look up into the redwoods. Gaze into infinity over the meadows. Feel your mind expand. Reconnect with old friends&#8212;and yourself.</p>
<p>Bring out your memory book and unfold it. I, for one, would love to hear your stories.</p>

<h3>Caption correction</h3>
<p>If you would like to impress your colleagues with your knowledge of ancient trivia, tell them that the photo on the back cover of the fall '14 <i>Review</i> (shown below right), is not of Tom Vogler, it is Peter Smith, assistant to Chancellor McHenry for arts, who left a couple of years after this picture was taken (in 1966) to direct Dartmouth's Hopkins Center for the Arts. It was not a seminar, it was a posed photo, taken by Al Lowry, the first campus photographer, with yours truly in the checked shirt on the left.</p>
<p>How's that for Trivial Pursuits?</p>

<h3>Appreciation for the Smiths</h3>
<p>Many thanks for Peggy Townsend's excellent piece on Page and Eloise Smith [fall '14, "<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/rev-fall-14-road-to-65.html">Road to '65: Page Smith rides in to shake up the system</a>"]. Great memories there. Not only what they did for UC Santa Cruz, but the huge contribution they made to the community. There was no public art here (not even the museum) before they came. Page's concern for the homeless helped start the Homeless Services Center. They were a marvelous couple and enriched all of our lives.</p>

<h3>Dead reckoning</h3>
<p>Regarding "<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/rev-fall-14-philanthropy-focus.html">Quest to reopen the Quarry</a>": Hank Harrison in his book <i>The Dead</i> notes that in the early days of UC Santa Cruz the Grateful Dead offered to play a free concert in the (upper) Quarry Amphitheater&#8212;in support of the aims and values of the campus&#8212;but were turned down for fear of their newfound fans showing up in unmanageable numbers ... and conditions. Perhaps now that the band has its archives in the McHenry Library Special Collections and a drive is underway to reopen the Quarry, the surviving members of the band might be glad of an invitation to perform a benefit concert ... especially if they can try out new music.</p>

In speaking to colleagues around the country, this part of the UC Santa Cruz ethos is quite unique among other public research universities, and it explains why UCSC is frequently ranked among the top universities that are the best value for parents and students.</p>
<p>Publications by faculty in the Division of Social Sciences challenge mainstream assumptions about disciplines. Thus, it is not surprising that the Center for a Public Anthropology, an organization that encourages scholars and their students to address public problems in public ways, last year ranked the Division of Social Sciences faculty seventh in the nation for sharing research with the broad public through the media.</p>
<p>The Division of Social Sciences is the heart and soul of the campus, as well as the academic home of a stunning number of Banana Slugs. The division includes nearly 45 percent of the undergraduate majors at UCSC and about 25 percent of all the graduate students.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students&#8212;both incoming freshmen and transfer students&#8212;continue to knock down our door to major in the social sciences. When I am asked why the social sciences are so popular among today&#8217;s youth, I always point out that today&#8217;s students, particularly those special ones who decide to attend UCSC, are seeking to take classes on subjects that have clear relevance and purpose.</p>
<p>The importance of social sciences more generally is evident, for example, in news media reports, where nearly every story touches upon some aspect of the fabric of society. Today&#8217;s students are extremely interested in ethics, citizenship, and social and environmental responsibility, and they want to be able to give back to society when they graduate. All our majors provide this opportunity for our students.</p>
<p>When Social Sciences alumni tell me about their experiences at UCSC, they describe faculty and students from various disciplines and academic backgrounds interacting with one another and debating the major social and political problems of the day. Interdisciplinary research and education was common across the entire campus, and faculty in divergent fields of study would regularly collaborate with one another on important work.</p>
<p>Although the campus has grown, faculty and students still interact often and pursue interdisciplinary research and education, which makes UCSC in general&#8212;and the social sciences in particular&#8212;a very special place. While faculty at other universities are required to publish in only certain prescribed journals and students must take a fixed regimen of classes, the Division of Social Sciences is still a place where the uncommon becomes authentic, innovation meets ambition, and risk taking is not only encouraged&#8230; but is rewarded.</p>
<p>As we continue to move through this new century, my goal is to make the Division of Social Sciences even better and to allow even more students to attend UCSC and major in social sciences. I am working hard to accomplish this goal in partnership with dedicated, talented, hardworking faculty and staff.

<h2>Support takes many shapes: chair, barn, banana slug</h2>
<h3>Gift creates endowed chair in computer science</h3>
<p>Impressed by UC Santa Cruz's research in computer science, Mountain View-based Symantec gave $500,000 to endow a faculty chair&#8212; the first chair in the University of California system to take advantage of a new matching fund program established by UC President Janet Napolitano. This is also UC Santa Cruz's first corporate-funded chair.</p>
<p>The inaugural holder of the new Symantec Presidential Chair in Storage and Security is Professor Ethan Miller, director of the Center for Research in Storage Systems. The gift supports the Data Science Leadership initiative of The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<h3>Philanthropy raising a barn and supporting environmental programs</h3>
<p>The same techniques used to build the historic Hay Barn in the 1800s are being used to reconstruct it&#8212; including classic timber framing. The project is made possible by a $5 million gift from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation to create a center for environmental programs adjacent to the UC Santa Cruz Farm. The project supports the Coastal Sustainability initiative of The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<h3>At last, the beloved mascot of UC Santa Cruz will be understood!</h3>
<p>A crowd-funded project to sequence the genome of the banana slug surpassed its goal, with 139 people donating a total of $21,443 for the Banana Slug Genome Project. The results will provide insight on species diversity&#8212;and be the subject of hands-on student genomics research. Alumni Ken and Branwyn Wagman (Stevenson '78 and Kresge '79, respectively) got the ball rolling with a challenge gift. They were joined by fellow Slug Leslie Grate (Ph.D. '00, computer engineering) and his wife Lou, a past staff member in the UC Santa Cruz Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Department, who also did a match challenge. The project supports the Genomics Institute initiative of The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<h2>Campaign progress</h2>
<h3>Now at $190 million</h3>
<p>The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz seeks to build resources across campus and in signature initiatives. Publicly launched in October 2013, its goal is to raise $300 million by the end of the campaign to enhance UC Santa Cruz's extraordinary educational environment, high-impact research, and enduring commitment to social and environmental responsibility.</p>

<h3>Dress-up success</h3>
<p>To kick off UC Santa Cruz's 50th birthday year with a fashion flourish, the campus threw a "Dress Like It's 1965 Day" on January 15. Staff, faculty, students, and community members participated&#8212;and had a blast (from the past)! The Dress-up Day top winners were students Emily Graily and Sarah Logan, and professor of biomolecular engineering Kevin Karplus (below). Outfits were judged by <i>Mad Men</i> Co-Costume Designer Tiffany White Stanton (Kresge '03, psychology).&#160;<a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/kick-off">View all of the photos</a></p>

Approximately 72 percent of respondents read <em>Tuesday Newsday</em> every week and most in the morning. Five percent answered &#8220;Never, what&#8217;s <em>Tuesday Newsday</em>?&#8221;&#160; (We&#8217;re not sure how you found the survey but thanks. ) <br/><br/>News articles were judged most important followed by the &#8220;Heads Up &#8230;&#8221; section about campus business, and the Weekly Keynote. Most common were readers who read the summaries and click on some full stories; skimmers came next. <br/><br/>As for the popularity contest portion of the survey, 47 percent said the newsletter was &#8220;OK,&#8221; another 40 percent said they like it &#8220;a lot,&#8221; so that&#8217;s 87 percent generally positive. &#8220;Not so much&#8221; followed at 7 percent and &#8220;Delete without reading&#8221; was a little more than 5 percent. <br/><br/>Thanks to everyone for their comments. We&#8217;ll use the data in an effort to make <em>Tuesday Newsday</em> more useful and interesting. <br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="28847de7807270172dad5822d5f6f7f6"><name>barn-raising</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Barn raising set for re-creation of historic Cowell Ranch Hay Barn</title><summary>A new-fashioned community barn raising is set for Saturday, March 21 at UC Santa Cruz when professionals and volunteers will assemble and raise the timber framing for the re-creation of the historic Cowell Ranch Hay Barn. </summary><start-date>1426608000000</start-date><display-name>Cowell Ranch Hay Barn</display-name><path>/2015/03/barn-raising</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/barn-raising</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1426608913841</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1426634460925</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/barn-raise-1-460.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/barn-raise-1-460.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>barn-raise-1-460.jpg</name><display-name>barn-raise-1-460.jpg</display-name><file-size>78110</file-size><width>460</width><height>307</height></image><image-alt>barn construction</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/barn-raise-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/barn-raise-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>barn-raise-80.jpg</name><display-name>barn-raise-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>24885</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>barn construction</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>An original redwood sill plate is hoisted into place among more modern construction.

The barn most likely sheltered oxen used to haul wagons that carried limestone to lime kilns and redwood used as fuel for the kilns. <br/><br/>Built in the early 1860s, the original barn&#8217;s timber frame structure used pegged mortise and tenon joinery, a beautiful and durable construction style widespread on the east coast of the United States in the 19th century but rare in California. <br/><br/>The original barn was dismantled piece by piece in 2014 with pieces inventoried and cataloged. <br/><br/>The new barn brings together historic timber framing with modern construction. Saturday&#8217;s barn raising comes after excavation, soil stabilization, and a new concrete foundation and floor. The front and back ends are constructed with steel and modern wood framing. <br/><br/>The internal frame between the ends will be re-created with 10-inch by 10-inch redwood sill plates, and a combination of new and salvaged Douglas fir framing members. The timbers will be joined with mortises and tenons supported redwood braces. The whole system is pegged together using locust wood pegs. <br/><br/>Douglas fir beams up to 40 feet long were sourced from the Siskiyou Mountains in Southern Oregon and custom milled. Redwood timbers are from the Santa Cruz Mountains. Approximately two-thirds of the diagonal redwood braces are original and are being reused. <br/><br/>The volunteer team, led by master craftsman Karl Bareis of Santa Cruz Timberframes in Bonny Doon, will include contractors from the Santa Cruz Construction Guild, local woodworkers, and others from UC Santa Cruz. Bareis and his team built the re-created timbers using traditional woodworking techniques at his Bonny Doon yard.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/03/hay-barn.html</url><title>March 2013 announcement of barn reconstruction project</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-Ds4T7F50</url><title>Video of barn dismantling </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="296ad632807270172dad582285dabca7"><name>staff-personal-records</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Formal Review &amp; Employee Comment: PPSM 80 – Staff Personnel Records</title><summary>The University of California is proposing revisions to PPSM 80 Staff Personnel Records, a policy which applies to staff employees in the Professional &amp; Support Staff, Managers &amp; Senior Professionals, and Senior Management Group members.</summary><start-date>1426575600000</start-date><display-name>Formal Review &amp; Employee Comment: PPSM 80 – Staff Personnel Records</display-name><path>/2015/03/staff-personal-records</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/staff-personal-records</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1426624009747</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1426624009747</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California is proposing revisions to <i>PPSM 80 Staff Personnel Records</i>, a policy which applies to staff employees in the Professional &amp; Support Staff, Managers &amp; Senior Professionals, and Senior Management Group members.</p>
<p>A systemwide workgroup with representatives from HR Policy, OGC, UCPath, Records Management, Information Technology Services, and two campuses has reviewed the policy as part of the normal policy review cycle.&#160; Revisions, intended to clarify policy language and to reflect record-keeping in the electronic age, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A definition of personnel records in any format</li>
<li>The expansion of criteria for records not to be released to the public</li>
<li>The addition of a new section regarding Access to Records by Governmental Agencies</li>
<li>As best practice, when an employee transfers from one UC location to another, the new location becomes the office of record</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed policy is posted at: <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/tools-and-services/administrators/policies/proposed/ppsm-80.pdf">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/tools-and-services/administrators/policies/proposed/ppsm-80.pdf</a></p>

<p>The goal of the challenge is to stimulate the development of new tools and methods that will enable researchers to predict the behavior and function of a single cell in complex tissue over time. This ability could help reveal valuable information such as how cells transition from a healthy to diseased state, or identify changes that influence a cell's responsiveness to treatment.</p>
<p>Pourmand was one of five prize winners selected to receive monetary prizes totaling $88,000. The winners will now advance, along with the other 11 finalists from Phase 1, to the challenge's second phase, which requires innovators to generate proof-of-concept data.</p>
<p>Pourmand's proposal is based on the nanopipette technology his lab developed, which allows researchers to take miniscule samples from inside a cell without affecting the activity or viability of the cell. The nanopipette can take many repetitive cell samples over a period of minutes, hours, days, or weeks. These small samples can then be analyzed to monitor changes in gene expression that occur as a cell ages or undergoes other changes.</p>
<p>Pourmand said he plans to use the nanopipette technology in combination with powerful nanogenomic technology, also developed in his lab, to monitor genomic changes in breast cancer cells over time. The studies will focus on the molecular basis of drug resistance in breast cancer cells to understand how resistance is maintained in growing tumors and how resistant cells revert to drug sensitive cells.</p>
<p>"We believe these studies will provide fundamental information on the basis for chemotherapy resistance and sensitivity which could not be obtained using any other technology," Pourmand said.</p>
<p>Winners of Phase 2 will be awarded prize money from a pool of $400,000, to be announced July 31, 2017. The Phase 1 prize winners will be presented and recognized as part of the 3rd Annual Single Cell Analysis Investigators Meeting, which is scheduled for April 20-21, 2015, at the Natcher Conference Center on the NIH Campus in Bethesda, Maryland.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/01/nanobiopsy.html</url><title>New technique allows 'nanobiopsies' of living cells</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2f269601807270172dad5822d1d92982"><name>rev-spring-15-tiucsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>This is UC Santa Cruz </title><summary>A roundup of top news stories from UC Santa Cruz.</summary><start-date>1426662000000</start-date><display-name>This is UC Santa Cruz </display-name><path>/2015/03/rev-spring-15-tiucsc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/rev-spring-15-tiucsc</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1426720200161</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1426796203816</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/tiucsc-stuart-josh-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/tiucsc-stuart-josh-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tiucsc-stuart-josh-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>tiucsc-stuart-josh-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21226</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Josh Stuart, professor of biomolecular engineering, is a leader of the International Cance</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><figure class="article-image width-280"><img alt="Josh Stuart, professor of biomolecular engineering, is a leader of the International Cancer Genome Consortium's pan-cancer analysis project, which will test new protocols and tools developed by the center.

<h3>Big money for big data</h3>
<p>The National Institutes of Health awarded $11 million to UC Santa Cruz to create the technical infrastructure needed for the broad application of genomics in medicine and biomedical research.</p>
<p>This grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute funds the Center for Big Data in Translational Genomics. The center is a multi-institutional partnership based at UC Santa Cruz and led by David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.</p>
<p>The center's overarching goal is to help the biomedical community use genomic information to better understand human health and disease. To do this, scientists must be able to share and analyze genomic datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than those that can be handled by the existing infrastructure. Advances in DNA sequencing technology have made it increasingly affordable to sequence a person's entire genome, but managing genomic and related data from millions of individuals is a daunting challenge.</p>
<figure class="article-image width-280"><img alt="Power of the pounce" height="98" src="images/tiucsc-pounce.jpg" width="300"/></figure>
<h3>Power of the pounce</h3>
<p>Scientists at UC Santa Cruz, using a new wildlife tracking collar they developed, were able to continuously monitor the movements of mountain lions in the wild and determine how much energy the big cats use to stalk, pounce, and overpower their prey.</p>
<p>The new collar&#8212;equipped with GPS, accelerometers, and other high-tech features&#8212;tells researchers not just where an animal is but what it is doing and how much its activities "cost" in terms of energy expenditure.</p>
<p>"Understanding the energetics of wild animals moving in complex environments is valuable information for developing better wildlife management plans," said first author Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>

<h3>New dean of Humanities</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has appointed Tyler Stovall to serve as dean of the Humanities Division, effective spring quarter.</p>

<p>Stovall comes to the campus from UC Berkeley, where he was a professor of French history and dean of the Undergraduate Division of the College of Letters and Science.</p>
<p>Prior to that, Stovall spent 13 years as a faculty member in the UC Santa Cruz Humanities Division. During his last three years at Santa Cruz, he also served as chair of the History Department and provost of Stevenson College.</p>
<p>"The humanities are central to intellectual life in the 21st century," said Stovall. "I am thrilled to come to UC Santa Cruz, a university known locally and globally for its pioneering contributions to humanistic education and research."</p>

<h3>Genomics Institute releases Ebola genome browser</h3>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute released a new Ebola genome browser in September to assist global efforts to develop a vaccine and antiserum to help stop the spread of the Ebola virus.</p>
<p>The team led by UC Santa Cruz researcher Jim Kent worked around the clock for a week, communicating with international partners to gather and present the most current data.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz established the UCSC Ebola Genome Portal, with links to the new Ebola genome browser as well as links to all the relevant scientific literature on the virus.</p>
<p>"We need a heroic worldwide effort to contain Ebola," said Kent, who 15 years ago created the first working draft of the human genome. "Making an informatics resource like the genome browser for Ebola researchers is the least we could do."</p>

<h3>Lick funding to continue</h3>
<p>The University of California Office of the President reversed a previous decision to pull funding from Lick Observatory by 2018.</p>
<p>Lick Observatory operations will continue under the management of UC Observatories (UCO), the multicampus astronomical research unit headquartered at UC Santa Cruz. "We are thrilled to hear this news," said UCO Interim Director Claire Max, adding that there are enough funds in the projected budgets of UCO to run Lick Observatory for the next five years, albeit at a frugal level. Lick has an annual operating budget of approximately $1.5 million. Ongoing fundraising efforts and potential partnerships currently being explored may provide additional funding for Lick.</p>

<h3>A decade later: organic food</h3>
<p>Ten years ago, UC Santa Cruz professor Julie Guthman's book <i>Agrarian Dreams: The Paradox of Organic Farming in California,</i> was hailed as precedent setting, the first social science study of organic foods in the United States.</p>
<p>A lot has happened in a decade. Sixty percent of consumers now say they buy organics at least occasionally. Most supermarkets feature an organics section or private label for organics. For a while, organic sales grew at a 20-percent-ayear clip.</p>
<p>In a new second edition just published (University of California Press), Guthman, a professor of social sciences and UC Santa Cruz alumna (Kresge '79, sociology), takes a new look at the state of the organic food movement and some of the strange puzzles that afflict it.</p>
<h3>Action! Best college for film majors</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was recently ranked No. 7 in the country by College Factual for Best Bachelors Program for Film, Video, and Photographic Arts.</p>
<p>The campus was featured in a Top 10 list along with such institutions as USC, NYU, UC Berkeley, and UCLA.</p>
<p>The data used by College Factual for the rankings includes outcomes such as graduation rates and average starting salary.</p>
<h3>UC Santa Cruz in top five for NIH funding</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is in the top five of institutions that have seen significant increases in funding from the National Institutes of Health over the past decade.</p>
<p>At the same time a number of other institutions have suffered sizeable drops.</p>
<p>According to "Science Squeezed," a series of reports on biomedical funding by NPR, NIH funding soared between 1998 and 2003, which created a gold-rush mentality in biomedicine. But since 2004, the NIH budget has dropped by more than 20 percent (not including federal stimulus money during 2009 and 2010).</p>
<p>According to the report, UC Santa Cruz has seen NIH funding increase from about $14 million in 2000 to almost $30 million in 2013. The campus is one of 10 universities that have enjoyed increased funding. In contrast, another group of universities, many with previous funding totals in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually, have seen sizeable drops.</p>
<h3>Moving up in world rankings</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is ranked 93 among the world's best universities and in the top 50 in the U.S., according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) published by a Shanghai education-consulting firm.</p>
<p>It's a move up at least eight places for the campus, which last year was listed in the 101-150 category. The annual study by the Shanghai Ranking Consultancy, a firm spun off five years ago from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, looks at more that 1,200 universities in the world and publishes data on what it deems are the top 500.</p>

<h3>Student support gives major boost to Quarry reopening</h3>
<p>Efforts to restore and reopen the landmark Quarry Amphitheater received a major boost with the endorsement of using up to $6.38 million in existing student fee reserves toward the project.</p>
<p>The Quarry, which has been closed to events since 2006, had served as a center of campus life since UC Santa Cruz was founded 50 years ago.</p>
<p>The Student Fee Advisory Committee, which endorsed use of fees toward the project, is the primary avenue for advising the chancellor and executive vice chancellor on allocation of fees. The committee is composed of students and other campus representatives.</p>
<p>"This is an exciting advancement of this project," said Alison Galloway, executive vice chancellor and provost. "We are grateful for this powerful endorsement by students. We hope it inspires our alumni and others to join in bringing back this quintessential gathering space in the heart of campus."</p>
<p>During <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend2015/">Alumni Weekend</a>, April 23-26, tours of the Quarry will be offered, and visitors will have the opportunity to share their Quarry stories.</p>
<p>An estimated $1.2 million in additional funding is needed to move forward with the initial phase of the project, which will reopen the Quarry. If fundraising is successful, work is projected to begin in 2016.</p>
Reopening the Quarry Amphitheater is a priority of <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu">The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="32c22c7f807270172dad5822f2351f66"><name>bioengineering-symposium</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz to host UC Systemwide Bioengineering Symposium</title><summary>The Bioengineering Symposium will bring together faculty, researchers, and students from all ten UC campuses.</summary><keywords>Mark Akeson, bioengineering symposium</keywords><start-date>1426748400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz to host UC Systemwide Bioengineering Symposium</display-name><path>/2015/03/bioengineering-symposium</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/bioengineering-symposium</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1426780728411</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1426781546390</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/moerner-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/moerner-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moerner-250.jpg</name><display-name>moerner-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>53347</file-size><width>250</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt>W.

<p><b>Title:</b> Counselor</p>
<h3>Why do you volunteer with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>I volunteer for UC Santa Cruz because I found an opportunity to continue to utilize my skills as a mother and nurture young college students.</p>
<p>Prior to transferring to UC Santa Cruz in 2011, I was made aware of the Smith Renaissance Society, a cross-generational community within the university that provides financial, academic, and social support to current students. Typically, Smith Renaissance Society students have been orphaned, in foster care, homeless, or have had extreme adverse childhood experiences that have left them without traditional parental support.</p>
<p>Upon my arrival to campus, I began to mentor my first student. Since that time, I have had the privilege of mentoring many other Smith Society students. I eventually became a member of the Smith Renaissance Society's board, and most recently I became the board president. What has been most rewarding about volunteering with the Smith Renaissance Society is that I have been able to share a mother's love with a group of individuals who have not always known what it was like to be loved by a mother. In exchange, they have loved me back unconditionally. It has truly been an emotionally rewarding experience. I have been able to support some of these students through graduation, getting their careers started, and have even been there for the birth of a few children. Being a member of Smith Renaissance Society is more like being a member of a large family.</p>
<h3>What types of things do you do as a Slug volunteer?</h3>
<p>Over the years, I have been able to mentor students, have them in my home for dinners and birthday parties, provide academic assistance, friendship, emotional support, and anything else they need to make their college experience at UC Santa Cruz a pleasant one. Thanks to the generous hearts of other UC Santa Cruz alumni and community members, we are also able to offer our students financial assistance in the form of scholarships as well. It is truly a unique and amazing community.</p>
<h3>What has been the most rewarding thing about volunteering with your alma mater?</h3>
<p>Serving the Smith Renaissance Society has provided me with so many wonderful memories. Throughout the academic year we have so many fun activities, from Music Day and College Camp where we outreach to local foster youth and encourage them to see college as an achievable goal, to our annual invitation to the chancellor's reception at University House. Additionally, I have formed lifelong relationships with some incredibly amazing people that I would not have had the pleasure of meeting had it not been for my desire to volunteer with this community.</p>
<h3>Words of advice for those thinking of volunteering with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>I encourage anyone who has a desire to serve to find an area that they are passionate about and simply ask the question, "What can I do for you?" It really is that simple. As a result of my posing that question over three years ago, I have found a fulfillment in life that I was not expecting to find.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2014/10/volunteer-profile-madrid</path><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Volunteer Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2014/10/volunteer-profile-madrid</link><site>news</site><name>volunteer-profile-madrid</name><display-name>Volunteer profile: John Madrid</display-name><title>Volunteer profile: John Madrid</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz was and still is a magical place for me.

are?&#8221;</em><br/><br/>So begins <strong><em>Rad American Women A-Z: Rebels, Trailblazers, and Visionaries Who Shaped Our History&#8230;And Our Future</em></strong>, a new book for kids by UC Santa Cruz alumna Kate Schatz. <br/><br/>It features the stories of 26 women who have had a major impact on American life--from artists and abolitionists, to scientists and sports heroes, to rock stars and writers.<br/><br/>It also has the distinction of being the first children&#8217;s book published by San Francisco&#8217;s famed City Lights Publishers in the company&#8217;s 60-year history.<br/><br/>&#8220;I decided to write this book so that my daughter would have something fun, informative, and empowering to read when she was old enough,&#8221; said Schatz. &#8220;But the more I talked to friends about the idea, the more I felt their enthusiasm around it, and realized the legitimate need for a book like this.&#8221;<br/><br/>A graduate of UC Santa Cruz in 2001 with a B.A. in Women&#8217;s Studies &amp; Creative Writing, Schatz said that her time on campus had a major influence on her life and the book. <br/><br/>&#8220;I loved my experience at Santa Cruz, and remain so glad that I was able to go there,&#8221; said Schatz. "UCSC was incredibly formative in so many ways, and many of my closest friends are my UCSC pals. I'm still close with several of my professors as well, which I think is pretty remarkable.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Majoring in Women's Studies (now Feminist Studies) and Creative Writing pretty much shaped everything. I came in wanting to be an Environmental Studies major, but I took <em>Intro to Feminism</em> with Bettina Aptheker my first quarter--and that was that. Then I took a fiction writing class, and that, too, was that,&#8221; she added.<br/><br/>&#8220;Women's Studies became the lens through which I learned about and came to understand so many different fields, from literature to economics to history. Creative Writing workshops became the place where I took all of that critical thought and worked it into characters and new language. The two fields of study were so complementary-- I'm pretty excited at how they've come to directly influence what I'm doing now!&#8220;<br/><br/>Schatz&#8217;s <em>Rad American Women</em> includes many bold, visionary women whose names and achievements will be recognized by many, including tennis star <strong>Billie Jean King</strong>, farmworker activist <strong>Dolores Huerta</strong>, comedian <strong>Carol Burnett</strong>, Supreme Court Justice <strong>Sonia Sotomayo</strong>r, rock singer/poet <strong>Patti Smith</strong>, and author <strong>Ursula LeGuin</strong>.<br/><br/>But the A-Z book also introduces readers to women they might not have heard of, such as <strong>Ella Baker</strong>, who mentored Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and helped shape the Civil Rights Movement. In fact, Schatz reserves the letter &#8220;X&#8221; <em>For The Women Whose Names We Don&#8217;t Know</em>&#8212;noting &#8220;it&#8217;s for the women we haven&#8217;t learned about yet, and the women whose stories we will never read.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;We all need role models, and the more we can expand the pool of visible, familiar faces and names, the better,&#8221; said Schatz, who is Chair of the School of Literary Arts at Oakland School for the Arts, where she teaches fiction, poetry, and journalism to 9th-12th graders. <br/><br/>&#8220;American history gets pretty fixed on a few singular figures, especially when it comes to women and people of color. I hope this book opens up the field of history a bit, and shows readers&#8212;whether they're boys or girls, kids or grown-ups&#8212;some new inspiring figures.&#8221;<br/><br/><em>Rad American Women A-Z</em> includes graphic paper-cut style illustrations by Miriam Klein Stahl.

A new instrument, called NIROSETI, will soon scour the sky for messages from other worlds.</p>
<p>"Infrared light would be an excellent means of interstellar communication," said Shelley Wright, an assistant professor of physics at UC San Diego who led the development of the new instrument while at the University of Toronto's Dunlap Institute for Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics.</p>
<p>Wright worked on an earlier SETI project at Lick Observatory as a UC Santa Cruz undergraduate, when she built an optical instrument designed by UC Berkeley researchers. The infrared project takes advantage of new technology not available for that first optical search.</p>
<p>Infrared light would be a good way for extraterrestrials to get our attention here on Earth, since pulses from a powerful infrared laser could outshine a star, if only for a billionth of a second. Interstellar gas and dust is almost transparent to near infrared, so these signals can be seen from great distances. It also takes less energy to send information using infrared signals than with visible light.</p>
<p>Frank Drake, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and director emeritus of the SETI Institute, said there are several additional advantages to a search in the infrared realm.</p>
<p>"The signals are so strong that we only need a small telescope to receive them. Smaller telescopes can offer more observational time, and that is good because we need to search many stars for a chance of success," said Drake.</p>
<p>The only downside is that extraterrestrials would need to be transmitting their signals in our direction, Drake said, though he sees this as a positive side to that limitation. "If we get a signal from someone who's aiming for us, it could mean there's altruism in the universe. I like that idea. If they want to be friendly, that's who we will find."</p>
<p>Scientists have searched the skies for radio signals for more than 50 years and expanded their search into the optical realm more than a decade ago. The idea of searching in the infrared is not a new one, but instruments capable of capturing pulses of infrared light only recently became available.</p>
<p>"We had to wait," Wright said. "I spent eight years waiting and watching as new technology emerged."</p>
<p>Now that technology has caught up, the search will extend to stars thousands of light years away, rather than just hundreds. NIROSETI, or Near-Infrared Optical Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, could also uncover new information about the physical universe.</p>
<p>"This is the first time Earthlings have looked at the universe at infrared wavelengths with nanosecond time scales," said Dan Werthimer, UC Berkeley SETI Project Director. "The instrument could discover new astrophysical phenomena, or perhaps answer the question of whether we are alone."</p>
<p>NIROSETI will also gather more information than previous optical detectors by recording levels of light over time so that patterns can be analyzed for potential signs of other civilizations.</p>
<p>"Searching for intelligent life in the universe is both thrilling and somewhat unorthodox," said Claire Max, director of UC Observatories and professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. "Lick Observatory has already been the site of several previous SETI searches, so this is a very exciting addition to the current research taking place."</p>
<p>NIROSETI will be fully operational by early summer and will scan the skies several times a week on the Nickel 1-meter telescope at Lick Observatory, located on Mt. Hamilton east of San Jose.</p>
<p>The NIROSETI team also includes Geoffrey Marcy and Andrew Siemion from UC Berkeley; Patrick Dorval, a Dunlap undergraduate, and Elliot Meyer, a Dunlap graduate student; and Richard Treffers of Starman Systems. Funding for the project comes from the generous support of Bill and Susan Bloomfield.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4799d09f807270172dad58222bb812ec"><name>wandering-jupiter</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Wandering Jupiter accounts for our unusual solar system</title><summary>Jupiter swept clear the inner solar system, resulting in the formation of a planetary system unlike any other astronomers have yet found </summary><keywords>Greg Laughlin, Jupiter, solar system, extrasolar planets, exoplanets</keywords><start-date>1427137200000</start-date><display-name>Wandering Jupiter accounts for our unusual solar system</display-name><path>/2015/03/wandering-jupiter</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/wandering-jupiter</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1427130404974</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1427209047155</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/jupiter-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/jupiter-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jupiter-400.jpg</name><display-name>jupiter-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>45109</file-size><width>400</width><height>436</height></image><image-alt>Jupiter</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/jupiter-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/jupiter-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jupiter-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jupiter-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17859</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jupiter</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Jupiter is thought to have migrated inward toward the sun before retreating to its current position in the solar system.

(Credit: Batygin and Laughlin, <i>PNAS</i>)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Scientists say Jupiter swept clear the inner solar system, resulting in the formation of a planetary system unlike any other astronomers have yet found </article-subhead><article-text><p>Jupiter may have swept through the early solar system like a wrecking ball, destroying a first generation of inner planets before retreating into its current orbit, according to a new study published March 23 in <i><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/03/18/1423252112.abstract">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>.</i> The findings help explain why our solar system is so different from the hundreds of other planetary systems that astronomers have discovered in recent years.</p>
<p>"Now that we can look at our own solar system in the context of all these other planetary systems, one of the most interesting features is the absence of planets inside the orbit of Mercury," said Gregory Laughlin, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and coauthor of the paper. "The standard issue planetary system in our galaxy seems to be a set of super-Earths with alarmingly short orbital periods. Our solar system is looking increasingly like an oddball."</p>
<p>The new paper explains not only the "gaping hole" in our inner solar system, he said, but also certain characteristics of Earth and the other inner rocky planets, which would have formed later than the outer planets from a depleted supply of planet-forming material.</p>
<p>Laughlin and coauthor Konstantin Batygin explored the implications of a leading scenario for the formation of Jupiter and Saturn. In that scenario, proposed by another team of astronomers in 2011 and known as the "Grand Tack," Jupiter first migrated inward toward the sun until the formation of Saturn caused it to reverse course and migrate outward to its current position. Batygin, who first worked with Laughlin as an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz and is now an assistant professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology, performed numerical calculations to see what would happen if a set of rocky planets with close-in orbits had formed prior to Jupiter's inward migration.</p>
<p>At that time, it's plausible that rocky planets with deep atmospheres would have been forming close to the sun from a dense disk of gas and dust, on their way to becoming typical "super-Earths" like so many of the exoplanets astronomers have found around other stars. As Jupiter moved inward, however, gravitational perturbations from the giant planet would have swept the inner planets (and smaller planetesimals and asteroids) into close-knit, overlapping orbits, setting off a series of collisions that smashed all the nascent planets into pieces.</p>
<p>"It's the same thing we worry about if satellites were to be destroyed in low-Earth orbit. Their fragments would start smashing into other satellites and you'd risk a chain reaction of collisions. Our work indicates that Jupiter would have created just such a collisional cascade in the inner solar system," Laughlin said.</p>
<p>The resulting debris would then have spiraled into the sun under the influence of a strong "headwind" from the dense gas still swirling around the sun. The ingoing avalanche would have destroyed any newly-formed super-Earths by driving them into the sun. A second generation of inner planets would have formed later from the depleted material that was left behind, consistent with evidence that our solar system's inner planets are younger than the outer planets. The resulting inner planets--Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars--are also less massive and have much thinner atmospheres than would otherwise be expected, Laughlin said.</p>
<p>"One of the predictions of our theory is that truly Earth-like planets, with solid surfaces and modest atmospheric pressures, are rare," he said.</p>
<p>Planet hunters have detected well over a thousand exoplanets orbiting stars in our galaxy, including nearly 500 systems with multiple planets. What has emerged from these observations as the "typical" planetary system is one consisting of a few planets with masses several times larger than the Earth's (called super-Earths) orbiting much closer to their host star than Mercury is to the sun. In systems with giant planets similar to Jupiter, they also tend to be much closer to their host stars than the giant planets in our solar system. The rocky inner planets of our solar system, with relatively low masses and thin atmospheres, may turn out to be fairly anomalous.</p>
<p>According to Laughlin, the formation of giant planets like Jupiter is somewhat rare, but when it occurs the giant planet usually migrates inward and ends up at an orbital distance similar to Earth's. Only the formation of Saturn in our own solar system pulled Jupiter back out and allowed Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars to form. Therefore, another prediction of the paper is that systems with giant planets at orbital periods of more than about 100 days would be unlikely to host multiple close-in planets, Laughlin said.</p>
<p>"This kind of theory, where first this happened and then that happened, is almost always wrong, so I was initially skeptical," he said. "But it actually involves generic processes that have been extensively studied by other researchers. There is a lot of evidence that supports the idea of Jupiter's inward and then outward migration. Our work looks at the consequences of that. Jupiter's 'Grand Tack' may well have been a 'Grand Attack' on the original inner solar system."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="47dd529c807270172dad5822646f29d8"><name>bicycle-thefts</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Crime Bulletin - Bicycle thefts</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is seeking the public's help with its investigation into nearly two dozen reported bicycle thefts since February 24. </summary><start-date>1426921200000</start-date><display-name>Community Crime Bulletin - Bicycle thefts</display-name><path>/2015/03/bicycle-thefts</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/bicycle-thefts</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1427134829177</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1427134894951</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is seeking the public's help with its investigation into nearly two dozen reported bicycle thefts since February 24.

Working south to north, seven more would follow before lunch, with the final three completed by 1:25 p.m., lifted by a crane and settled onto 10-inch by 10-inch redwood sill plates bolted to a concrete slab. <br/><br/>The barn raising Saturday, March 21, 2015 at the base of the UC Santa Cruz campus progressed remarkably smoothly with about 20 professional timber framers leading the action and a crew of 50 skilled volunteers supplying additional labor. By noon a large crowd had gathered on a nearby hillside to watch the installation of massive but intricately fitted timbers. By late afternoon Sunday, all timber framing was finished. <br/><br/>Framers had assembled the structures known as &#8220;bents&#8221; on the ground before Saturday&#8217;s raising. Weeks earlier, skilled apprentices, led by master framer Karl Bareis at <a href="http://www.santacruztimberframes.com/">Santa Cruz Timberframes</a> in Bonny Doon, crafted each timber according to a precise plan.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Bent into shape</strong></strong></p>
<p>Each bent consists of a 40-foot-long Douglas fir beam attached to three 8-inch by-8-inch posts 18 1/2 feet tall and secured with horizontal &#8220;girts&#8221; and diagonal redwood braces. Bents form the primary structure for the re-creation of the hay barn that was built in the early 1860s. The timbers are joined by interlocking mortises and tenons, secured by locust wood pegs, a framing technique that dates back to 19th century New England. <br/><br/>The barn is being rebuilt as a center for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s environmental and sustainability programs and will become the home of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems and a campus and community hub. <br/><br/>The project has been made possible by the Helen and Will Webster Foundation. Saturday afternoon, Alec Webster, a machinist with UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Particle Physics for 15 years, and a UC Santa Cruz alumnus (College Eight, 2002, Environmental Studies), recounted for 125 guests who had gathered for the barn raising celebration that several years ago he pointed out the barn to his father, Will, and said he wanted to restore it as a center for environmental programs. Alec Webster said he admired the skilled craftsmanship in the original barn and hoped to replicate it in a restoration. <br/><br/>Webster thanked his father, who attended the ceremony and watched the raising, for supporting the idea. "It&#8217;s such a huge project, it&#8217;s hard to believe it&#8217;s happening now,&#8221; Alec Webster said after spending the morning on the project, placing braces to link timbers together. &#8220;We hope to inspire others people to come join us and rebuild the barn. We want the community involved.&#8221; <br/><br/>The new barn brings together historic timber framing with modern construction. The original barn was dismantled in 2014 with pieces inventoried and cataloged. What could be reused was.</p>
<p><strong>A balancing act</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a balancing act,&#8221; explained Berkeley architect Richard Fernau, of the use and placement of old timbers. Fernau, a member of UCSC&#8217;s pioneer class, and his firm Fernau &amp; Hartman developed the detailed project plan. &#160;<br/><br/>The original pieces add authenticity and history, the new timbers add strength and support. &#8220;This is going to be a teaching tool,&#8221; Fernau said. &#8220;It tells the story of what was here.&#8221; The timber framing, old and new, will be visible inside when the barn is completed by fall. <br/><br/>Fernau noted that five other members of his pioneer class were on hand for the barn raising. One, Santa Cruz videographer Eric Thiermann documented the events.<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing,&#8221; Fernau said. &#8220;Fifty years ago we attended our first classes and here we are again.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>50 years of UC Santa Cruz</strong></p>
<p>The barn has become part of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s yearlong 50th anniversary celebrations, which will culminate in late September, 50 years to the day that the first class was held on the new UC campus built on the old Cowell Ranch. <br/><br/>The hay barn site lies at the heart of the nationally registered Cowell Lime Works Historic District. In its day the barn most likely sheltered hay and oxen used to haul wagons that carried limestone to lime kilns and the redwood used as fuel for the kilns. <br/><br/>Construction is proceeding in two phases. When the current phase to complete a weather-tight exterior is finished, the barn will contain a large multipurpose space for exhibitions, assemblies, and barn dances, among others, along with a 300-square-foot conference room, restrooms, and utility rooms. <br/><br/>A future phase &#8211; still to be funded &#8211;will add other conference rooms, kitchenette, and exterior improvements&#160; &#8211; landscaping, an outdoor gathering area and amphitheater, picnic area, graded path to the farm, and bike racks. <br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/07/3914.html</url><title>Presevationists hope to tear down, rebuild barn</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/03/hay-barn.html</url><title> Historic Hay Barn to be reinvented as environmental center</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/03/barn-deconstruction.html</url><title>Deconstruction begins of historic Cowell Ranch barn </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/03/barn-raising.html</url><title>Barn raising set for re-creation of historic Cowell Ranch hay barn</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.santacruztimberframes.com/</url><title>Santa Cruz Timberframes</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.tfguild.org/</url><title>Timber Framers Guild</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4c80c47f807270172dad58226a0029b8"><name>bettina-aptheker</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Bettina Aptheker: Building Feminist Studies at UC Santa Cruz</title><start-date>1427180400000</start-date><display-name>Bettina Aptheker: Building Feminist Studies at UC Santa Cruz</display-name><path>/2015/03/bettina-aptheker</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/bettina-aptheker</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1427212649569</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1427216358634</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/bettina-aptheker.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/bettina-aptheker.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bettina-aptheker.jpg</name><file-size>63928</file-size><width>600</width><height>407</height></image><image-alt>Bettina Aptheker</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/bettina-aptheker-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/bettina-aptheker-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bettina-aptheker-thumb.jpg</name><file-size>4691</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Bettina Aptheker</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A scholar of history with a national reputation for her talents as an instructor, Bettina Aptheker taught one of the country's largest and most influential introductory feminist studies courses for nearly three decades at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</p>
<p>Starting out in 1980 as the sole lecturer in the Women's Studies Department, she became the department's first ladder-rank faculty member in 1987, and was honored with the Alumni Association's Distinguished Teaching Award in 2001.</p>
<p>Students often describe their time in Aptheker&#8217;s class as a &#8220;life-changing experience&#8221; and an &#8220;eye-opener.&#8221; A deeply compelling speaker, Aptheker, incorporates art, poetry, guest speakers, historical essays, slides, videos, and music into multifaceted, multimedia courses that linger in the minds of undergraduates long after they leave the classroom.</p>
<p>Aptheker&#8217;s 2006 book, Intimate Politics: How I Grew Up Red, Fought for Free Speech and Became A Feminist Rebel, tells the fascinating story of her life. Described by the Chronicle of Higher Education as a &#8220;stunning memoir,&#8221; it traces her role in major historical and political events ranging from her co-leadership of the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley, the movement against the war in Vietnam, and the trial of Angela Davis, to the building of the Women's Studies Department at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</p>
<p>Aptheker, who received her Ph.D. in History of Consciousness from UC Santa Cruz, has been honored with the &#8220;Award for Excellence in Education&#8221; by the California chapter of the National Organization for Women. She was recently named a prestigious University of California Presidential Chair in Feminist Critical Race and Ethnic Studies at UC Santa Cruz, and is currently teaching a course on feminism and social justice.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www1.ucsc.edu/currents/02-03/12-02/speech.html</url><title>Free

top 25 graduate schools to study game design features UC Santa Cruz at number 8</article-subhead><article-text><p>The graduate programs in game design at UC Santa Cruz were named among the top programs in the country by the Princeton Review, an education services company. UC Santa Cruz was ranked 8th on the company's list of the "Top 25 Graduate Schools to Study Game Design for 2015."</p>
<p>"I'm excited to see UC Santa Cruz again among the best grad programs in the world for game design. The quality of our faculty and our students is amazing, and the two together create an incredible environment in which to study and to create games," said Brenda Romero, program director for the professional M.S. in games and playable media.</p>
<p>UCSC offers a broad range of programs in computer game design. The campus has three graduate programs with an emphasis on games: the professional M.S. in games and playable media; the digital arts and new media M.F.A.; and the Ph.D. or M.S. in computer science with a games focus. The Baskin School of Engineering also established the first undergraduate major in computer game design in the UC system in 2006.</p>
<p>The Princeton Review selected the schools on its list based on a survey it conducted in 2014-15 of 150 institutions offering game design coursework or degrees in the United States, Canada, and some countries abroad. The survey covered a range of topics, from academic offerings and faculty credentials to the starting salaries and employment experience of program graduates. Factors considered in the assessments included the program curriculum, faculty, facilities, career services, and technology.</p>

Hamilton for live music, evening astronomy lectures from world-renowned scientists, and the opportunity to view celestial objects through two historic telescopes.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Music of the Spheres&#8221; concert series gives the public a rare glimpse of the observatory at night, and all proceeds from the event benefit Lick Observatory. Due to the popularity of the summer program, a fifth concert evening has been added to lineup this year.</p>
<p>Each event features a musical performance, an astronomy lecture by a scientist, and a history presentation about Lick Observatory&#8217;s rich past. Afterwards, guests take turns viewing celestial objects through the 36-inch Great Lick Refractor and the 40-inch Nickel Reflector. Guests have additional opportunities to stargaze with small ground telescopes provided by amateur astronomers.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Music of the Spheres&#8221; concerts take place June 27 (San Jose Jazz&#8217;s Aaron Lington; speaker Peter Jenniskens of NASA Ames), July 11 (Oscar Reynolds Trio; speaker Aaron Romanowsky, San Jose State Univ.), July 25 (Ken Emerson; speaker Melissa Graham, UC Berkeley), August 8 (Highland Way; speaker J. Xavier Prochaska, UC Santa Cruz), and August 22 (White Album Ensemble; speaker Michael Bolte, UC Santa Cruz). General, preferred, and VIP tickets will be available. For additional details and ticket information, visit <a href="http://ucolick.org/summer/">ucolick.org/summer</a>.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Evenings with the Stars&#8221; program gives the public a chance to view through the 36-inch Great Lick Refractor and the 40-inch Nickel Reflector as well. Similar to the &#8220;Music of the Spheres&#8221; events, each program features an astronomy lecture by a &#8220;star&#8221; scientist, and a history presentation. Amateur astronomers also set up ground telescopes so that guests can get additional telescope time.</p>
<p>Dates for the Summer Visitors Program are June 12 (speaker Raja Guthathakurta, UC Santa Cruz), June 13 (speaker Martin Gaskill, UC Santa Cruz), June 26 (speaker Graeme Smith, UC Santa Cruz), July 10 (speaker Connie Rockosi, UC Santa Cruz), July 24 (speaker Mark Ammons, Lawrence Livermore National Lab), August 7 (speaker Geoff Marcy, UC Berkeley), and August 21 (Andreas Burkert, University of Munich). Tickets are $20. For additional details and ticket information, visit <a href="http://ucolick.org/summer/">ucolick.org/summer</a>.</p>
<p>Tickets for both&#160;&#8220;Music of the Spheres&#8221; and &#8220;Evenings with the Stars&#8221; will go on sale to the general public at noon on Friday, April 17 at <a href="https://santacruztickets.com">santacruztickets.com</a>. Members of <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/public/friends/index.html">Friends of Lick Observatory</a> (FoLO) can purchase tickets starting at noon on Friday, April 3.</p>
<p>Lick Observatory is located on the summit of Mt. Hamilton in the Diablo Range east of San Jose. Driving time from San Jose is about one hour via Mt. Hamilton Road (Route 130). Founded in 1888, Lick Observatory is at the forefront of astronomical research as an active research facility. It is operated by the UC Observatories (UCO), a multicampus research unit that serves eight UC campuses and is headquartered at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Additional information is available at <b><a href="http://ucolick.org/summer/">ucolick.org/summer</a>.</b></p>
<p>Please note: Weather may restrict telescope viewings, but other activities will still take place. Due to historic construction of the telescope domes, the 36-inch Refractor and the 40-inch Nickel Telescope are not wheelchair accessible at this time. Children must be at least 8 years of age for admission. Due to late hours the program may be difficult for children under 12.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>08-23-2015</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="52038832807270172dad58225726519e"><name>college-summit-seventh-graders</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Local seventh graders set sights on college</title><summary>Half of Santa Cruz County’s seventh graders – more than 1,400 – attended the 7th Grade College and Career Summit on campus on Friday, March 20.</summary><start-date>1427180400000</start-date><display-name>Local seventh graders set sights on college</display-name><path>/2015/03/college-summit-seventh-graders</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/college-summit-seventh-graders</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1427305105427</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1427309119609</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/7th Grade College and Career Summit.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/7th Grade College and Career Summit.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>7th Grade College and Career Summit.jpg</name><display-name>7th Grade College and Career Summit.jpg</display-name><file-size>156066</file-size><width>500</width><height>375</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/sammyblue.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/sammyblue.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sammyblue.jpg</name><display-name>sammyblue.jpg</display-name><file-size>23340</file-size><width>83</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Seventh graders from around Santa Cruz County listen to presentations at the Stevenson Event Center during their daylong visit to the UC Santa Cruz campus.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Half of Santa Cruz County&#8217;s seventh graders &#8211; more than 1,400 &#8211; attended the 7<sup>th</sup> Grade College and Career Summit on campus on Friday, March 20.</p>
<p>The annual visit is&#160;part of the Santa Cruz County College Commitment (S4C) &#8212; a collaboration between California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), Cabrillo College, local school districts, and UC Santa Cruz. The remaining half will attend a similar event at CSUMB next month.&#160;</p>
<p>For many students, the field trip is their first time on a college campus and an experience that makes a lasting impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal is to ensure all Santa Cruz County students understand how best to prepare for their future and to know we are right here in their backyard,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Associate Vice Chancellor of Enrollment Management Michelle Whittingham.</p>
<p>The pilot project began in May 2013 when 300 seventh-graders from across Santa Cruz County were welcomed to the UCSC campus. The goal was to provide an opportunity for students to explore college majors most relevant to their interests, and to see first-hand what their future studies might look like.&#160;</p>
<p>Results were so positive that the event was expanded to include every seventh grader in the county.&#160;In spring 2014, the full program launched, and all 3,000 seventh-grade students in Santa Cruz County visited either UC Santa Cruz or CSUMB.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were so pleased to see both their confidence level and their knowledge of required courses increase,&#8221; Whittingham said.</p>
<p>While on campus, students, teachers, and parent volunteers learned about courses students need to be eligible for college and ways to prepare, engaged with current UCSC students in a panel format, and attended a closing session to review what they had learned during the day.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, the middle school students were able to imagine what it would be like to attend college and learned specific steps on how to get there.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5314e14e807270172dad58220d8b17a3"><name>finance-workshop</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Workshop explores how digital technology changes the way financial markets function</title><summary>The Center for Analytical Finance (CAFIN) at UC Santa Cruz will hold a one-day workshop Friday, April 3 that looks at how digital technology has changed the way markets function.

<p>Technology has changed markets from collectibles to public stock exchanges by reducing the costs of matching buyers and sellers thus affecting how relevant information is shared and how transactions are executed.</p>
<p>The workshop, "<a href="http://cafin.ucsc.edu/news-events/events/upcoming-events/workshop-financial-access.html">Financial Access: New Platforms for Finance</a>," will take place from 1-6 p.m. at Engineering 2, Room 499 on the UC Santa Cruz campus. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>It will bring together <a href="http://cafin.ucsc.edu/news-events/events/upcoming-events/workshop-financial-access-speakers.html">practitioners, policymakers, and researchers</a> to assess recent developments and prospects for creating new technology and institutional platforms for financial markets.</p>
<p>Keynote speaker at an invitation-only dinner to follow is UC Santa Cruz alumnus Mike Cagney (Porter, &#8217;93) who graduated with a combined BA/MS degree in applied economics. He is co-founder, chairman, and chief executive of <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">Social Finance Inc. (SoFi)</a> in San Francisco that provides student loan re-financing, MBA loans, mortgages, and personal loans for early-stage professionals.</p>
<p>Cagney is also a co-founder and managing member of Cabezon Investment Group, a global macro hedge fund. Before Cabezon, he founded Finaplex, a wealth management software company and earlier was senior vice president and head trader for the proprietary trading and financial products group at Wells Fargo Bank.</p>
<p>Market advances have developed through innovative applications of technology and regulatory changes covering such areas as electronic communications and electronic payments. The JOBS Act of 2012 is an example of regulatory change applied to equity funding rules and mechanisms.</p>
<p>Some of the market arenas affected are equity crowd funding, online IPO auctions, securitized personal loans, and non-profit finance. These new market institutions and platforms have the potential to bring down the costs of financial intermediation, improve risk sharing, and increase access to finance in ways that improve how finance fuels the real economy.</p>
<p>CAFIN was founded in July 2013 and is affiliated with the UC Santa Cruz Economics Department. It is made up of researchers whose aim is to solve real-world problems of finance in a globalized financial system, focusing on systemic risk, market design, and financial access.</p>

<p>The event will include presentations by three UC Santa Cruz professors--<b>David Dunn </b><i>(&#8220;</i><i>Communication Within the Soundscape"</i>), <b>Jennifer Maytorena Taylor</b> (<i>&#8220;Selfies, Surveillance, and Social Documentation"</i>), and <b>J</b><b>. </b><b>Cameron Monroe</b> <i>(&#8220;Cana in Dahomey--A West African City in the Era of the Slave Trade&#8221;</i>)--plus guest conceptual artist and photographer <b>Catherine Wagner </b>from<b> </b>Mills College <i>("Art &amp; Science: Investigating Matter")</i>.</p>
<p><b>David Dunn </b>is<b> </b>an assistant professor of sound art and design in the UC Santa Cruz Music Department and a core faculty member in the Digital Arts and New Media graduate program.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Dunn has largely abandoned the pursuit of musical composition as an expressive form of communication to investigate the potential of sound to directly alter biological systems. Most recently, this has taken the form of designing acoustic strategies and technology to interfere with the population cycles of invasive insects directly tied to forest and agricultural destruction and global climate change.</p>
<p>Dunn said his talk will focus upon both his current and past work, and its underlying environmental argument.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of questions are consistent throughout my work,&#8221; Dunn noted. &#8220;What do music and sound contribute to our understanding of the question of mind? What is accomplished by strengthening our aural sense within a visually dominant culture? What is gained or lost by a shift towards an aural perception of the world? And how can art participate in the discovery of solutions that can accelerate or extend those of science?&#8221;</p>
<p>Assistant professor of film and digital media<b> Jennifer Maytorena Taylor</b> is an award-winning documentary producer and director of character-based, social-issue feature films and community journalism projects.</p>
<p>Her recent work includes the award-winning documentaries&#160;<i>New Muslim Cool</i>&#160;and&#160;<i>Special Circumstances,</i>&#160;and&#160;<i>Street Knowledge 2 College,&#160;</i>a 15-part web series for&#160;PBS.org.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a furiously changing media landscape where almost anybody can be a producer and almost nobody can afford to be careless about personal privacy, social documentary filmmakers increasingly need to explore and understand the increasingly sophisticated ways in which under-represented communities use media,&#8221; said Taylor<b>.</b></p>
<p>&#8220;I will show a number of examples from different projects of how I have experimented with a variety of production approaches to build authentic, meaningful, and universal stories about--and sometimes with--people in criminalized and/or marginalized communities and groups,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Associate professor of anthropology <b>J. Cameron Monroe</b>&#160;is the director of the Archaeological Research Center at UC Santa Cruz. Specializing in the archaeology of West Africa and the African Diaspora, he leads the Abomey Plateau Archaeological Project (B&#233;nin), which explores the dynamic histories of urbanism in West African during the era of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past few decades, archaeological research at forts, palaces, and rural villages across West Africa has rapidly transformed our understanding of how local societies coped with the widespread impacts of the trans-Atlantic slave trade,&#8221; Monroe noted.</p>
<p>Monroe said his talk will introduce the results of over a decade of archaeological field research in the Republic of B&#233;nin at the town of Cana. Cana was a major urban center of the Kingdom of Dahomey, a principle West African partner in the trans-Atlantic.</p>
<p><b>Catherine Wagner</b>&#160;is an award-winning artist and professor of studio art at Mills College who has been honored with the Rome Prize, a Guggenheim Fellowship, NEA Fellowships, and the Ferguson Award.&#160;</p>
<p>Her work is represented in major collections such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, SFMOMA, and The Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>
<p>Wagner said her presentation will be an edited version of artworks from her projects <i>Art &amp; Science: Investigating Matter, Cross Sections, Morphology, </i>and <i>Trilogy: Reflections on Frankenstein</i>.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;For over 20 years I have been observing contemporary culture,&#8221; said Wagner. &#8220;My process involves the investigation of what art critic David Bonetti calls &#8216;the systems people create (in essence the human condition), of our love of order, our ambition to shape the world, the value we place on knowledge, and the tokens we display to express ourselves.&#8217; To this end, I have examined institutions of learning and knowledge; our homes, and all of the ways we display who we are; Disneyland; science labs, including human genome research; and lastly, the structures that support art for museums.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Admission to the March 31 LASER talk is free</b>. The presentations begin at 7 p.m. in the Digital Arts Research Center building (DARC--Room 108).</p>

<p>Efforts to restore and reopen the landmark Quarry Amphitheater received a major boost with the endorsement of using up to $6.38 million in existing student fee reserves toward the project.</p>
<p>The Quarry, which has been closed to events since 2006, had served as a center of campus life since UC Santa Cruz was founded 50 years ago. The Student Fee Advisory Committee, which endorsed use of fees toward the project, is the primary avenue for advising the chancellor and executive vice chancellor on allocation of fees.</p>
<p>The committee is composed of students and other campus representatives.</p>
<p>"This is an exciting advancement of this project," said Alison Galloway, executive vice chancellor and provost. "We are grateful for this powerful endorsement by students. We hope it inspires our alumni and others to join in bringing back this quintessential gathering space in the heart of campus."</p>

<p>During <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend2015/">Alumni Weekend</a>, April 23-26, tours of the Quarry will be offered, and visitors will have the opportunity to share their Quarry stories. An estimated $1.2 million in additional funding is needed to move forward with the initial phase of the project, which will reopen the Quarry.</p>
<p>If fundraising is successful, work is projected to begin in 2016. Reopening the Quarry Amphitheater is a priority of <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/">The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>.</p>

He has interviewed thousands of prisoners, many on death row or in solitary confinement in the nation&#8217;s growing stable of &#8220;supermax&#8221; prisons. <br/><br/>Haney has been selected to deliver the 49th annual Faculty Research Lecture scheduled for Tuesday, April 7, 2015, at 7 p.m. at the Music Recital Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus. The lecture is free and open to the public. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and a reception will immediately follow. <br/><br/>Haney's lecture is titled "PrisonWorld: How Mass Incarceration Transformed U.S. Prisons, Impacted Prisoners, and Changed American Society.&#8221; The faculty research lecturer is selected each year by UC Santa Cruz Academic Senate. <br/><br/>Since the "war on drugs" in the early 1970s, U.S. prison numbers grew to account for 25 percent of all the world's prisoners even though the nation amounts to only 5 percent of the world's population. Haney has witnessed firsthand the profound transformation that has taken place in the American prison system, during a period that has been termed the &#8220;era of mass incarceration.&#8221; Since the publication of his 2006 book, <em>Reforming Punishment,</em> he has continued to document and assess conditions of confinement in many of the country&#8217;s harshest and most severe prisons.<br/><br/>During his lecture, Haney will illustrate and analyze his findings about the effects of the transformation of U.S. prison policies and conditions, including the rise of supermax prisons such as Pelican Bay in far northwestern California, and discuss the impact on prisoners most directly affected by it.<br/><br/>For decades, Haney, who joined UC Santa Cruz in 1977, has warned that surging prison populations and deteriorating conditions are a dangerous combination. &#8220;We need to remember that the overwhelming majority of prisoners will be released one day,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It should matter to all of us what state of mind they are in when they rejoin free society.&#8221; <br/><br/>In 1971, as a graduate student working with Philip Zimbardo&#160; at Stanford University, Haney took part in and documented the infamous Stanford Prison experiment that simulated incarceration with students randomly selected to be guards and prisoners. <br/><br/>Haney&#8217;s research hasn&#8217;t been limited to scholarly papers in obscure journals. Thursday, (March 26) Haney took part in the Bipartisan Summit on Criminal Justice Reform in Washington, D.C. joining advocates and analysts across the political spectrum to address the American criminal justice system and potential reforms. <br/><br/>Haney has testified before the U.S. Senate and the California Legislature. His testimony in a 1999 federal court case challenging the constitutionality of supermax conditions led to a landmark decision in Texas. Another landmark ruling, this time in California, ordered the state to drastically reduce its prison population. The United States Supreme Court cited Haney&#8217;s analysis and trial testimony in upholding the order.<br/><br/>He was named to a National Academy of Sciences panel of leading scholars and experts on corrections to study the causes and consequences of high rates of incarceration in the U.S. The panel&#8217;s report last year was a damning indictment of the growth of incarceration.<br/><br/>In recent years, policy makers have begun to take notice. In August 2013, reversing years of tough political rhetoric in Washington, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder declared that levels of incarceration at federal, state and local levels had become both "ineffective and unsustainable.&#8221;<br/><br/>"We cannot simply prosecute or incarcerate our way to becoming a safer country," he said. <br/><br/>In January, New York City officials said they would eliminate the use of solitary confinement for all inmates age 21 and younger at the notorious Rikers Island prison.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G1TYtg6oq0</url><title>Faculty Research Lecture video </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.prisonexp.org/psychology/42</url><title> Stanford Prison Experiment</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://senate.ucsc.edu/committees/cfrl-committee-on-faculty-research-lecture/current-year-lecture/index.html</url><title>UC Santa Cruz Academic Senate announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="585dc60f807270172dad5822949c0ced"><name>main</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New chief communications officer starts Wednesday</title><summary>Sherry Main joins UC Santa Cruz Wednesday, April 1, as assistant vice chancellor for communications and marketing.</summary><start-date>1427410800000</start-date><display-name>Sherry Main</display-name><path>/2015/03/main</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/03/main</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1427411682795</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1427411800408</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>UC Santa Cruz Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/03/images/main_sherry-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/03/images/main_sherry-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>main_sherry-250.jpg</name><display-name>main_sherry-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>31509</file-size><width>250</width><height>341</height></image><image-alt>Sherry Main</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Sherry Main has been named assistant vice chancellor for communications and marketing.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Sherry Main joins UC Santa Cruz Wednesday, April 1, as assistant vice chancellor for communications and marketing.

Much will depend upon negotiations between Governor Brown and UC President Napolitano.&#160; In addition, other relatively important sources of income locally are uncertain. The final budget will probably not be clear until the end of June. However, there are a few points that we can clarify.<br/><br/>Governor Brown has proposed a 4 percent increase in state funds to UC. Because state funding now makes up less than half of our core budget (tuition makes up most of the rest), it equates to less than a 2 percent overall increase and barely keeps up with inflation. Our basic mandatory costs alone are increasing at a faster rate.&#160; Mandatory costs include negotiated salary increases, faculty merit increases, benefit increases including retirement and health care, utility costs, and the cost of deferred maintenance.&#160; There are few ways to avoid these increases and even the remaining options would only forestall partly and temporarily the yearly increase.&#160; Adding in modest investments for high priority areas &#8211; employee compensation, rebuilding faculty lines, restoring teaching assistantships, student services, and graduate support &#8211; result in total costs increasing at a rate closer to 5 percent.<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz has few options to increase revenue to cover the gap. We can increase the number of students who pay the out-of-state portion of tuition. We can increase the number of total students to the limits of our Long Range Development Plan. The former will bring global contacts for all our students along with additional funding. The latter would have to be managed without proportional increases in faculty and staff. We can also expand Summer Session, which generates income while helping students graduate more quickly. Our budget projection assumes a combination of these efforts will close about one-half of the gap.<br/><br/>The UC system has proposed a budget in which there are tuition increases of up to 5 percent annually. Roughly 1.7 percent of this increase is dedicated to financial aid, leaving 3.3 percent to support campus operations.&#160; Coupled with the state funding increase and our own efforts to increase revenue, the resulting shortfall for UC Santa Cruz would be about $3 million. Without a tuition increase or additional state funding to cover the same amount, our shortfall would be about $7 million.&#160; Again, this is the likely annual scenario for the next few years.<br/><br/>At this point, we do not plan to implement permanent budget cuts for 2015-2016. Unless there is a confluence of bad outcomes, we will try to handle the shortfall in the coming year from non-permanent funds. This means, however, that the following year, 2016-2017, we will have to accommodate two years of permanent budget cuts. &#160;<br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7115c57d807270172dad5822bff9812f"><name>blumenthal-sf-chronicle</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Public higher education can again transform California</title><summary>As Gov.

<p>As Gov. Jerry Brown and UC President Janet Napolitano spar over the future of the University of California, my question is this: Are we content to offer today&#8217;s students, who are more racially and socioeconomically diverse than ever, less than their predecessors received?</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s UC system undergraduate population looks like this:</p>
<p>&#8226; 40 percent come from families in which neither parent earned a four-year college degree.</p>
<p>&#8226; 30 percent transferred from a California community college.</p>
<p>&#8226; 42 percent receive federal aid for low-income students &#8212; compared with only 15 percent at Ivy League universities.</p>
<p>Public higher education is a transformational force, a major lever that opens the doors of opportunity. Fifty years ago, California&#8217;s investment in public higher education reached its apex as three new UC campuses were coming online in Santa Cruz, Irvine and San Diego. UC tuition was virtually nil, and the gates of social mobility were open to all.</p>
<p>How times have changed.</p>
<p>Students protesting Napolitano&#8217;s proposed 5 percent tuition increase call for &#8220;free education.&#8221; A high-quality university education has never been free; somebody has to foot the bill. What has changed since 1965 is the level of public support for higher education in California. Indeed, correcting for inflation, if the state's per-student contribution to UC today matched 1965 levels, students would be paying no tuition.</p>
<p>Instead, resident tuition has topped $12,000 a year, and the governor&#8217;s proposed budget is likely to drive that number higher. Ironically, it was Gov. Ronald Reagan who first sounded the drumbeat of anti-UC rhetoric. He campaigned on a pledge to &#8220;clean up the mess at (UC) Berkeley&#8221; and, once elected, called for an end to free tuition, declaring that the state &#8220;should not subsidize intellectual curiosity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Voters bought the notion that the state could not afford the university and that students should bear the costs themselves. And here we are today: Students and their families contribute more to the funding of this public university than does the state.</p>
<p>Students aren&#8217;t the only ones paying for the erosion of public support, however.</p>
<p>California&#8217;s unprecedented investment 50 years ago put elite, private East Coast universities on notice, tilting the balance of excellence toward the West Coast, because UC offered quality, as well as access, to talented students from all backgrounds. It did more than transform the landscape of higher education; it shifted the balance of power in the country.</p>
<p>UC generates more patents than any other university in the nation. It is an incubator of discovery and innovation. Fifteen years ago, researchers on my own campus were the first to assemble a draft of the complete human genome &#8212; and they promptly posted it on the Web where it would be available to everyone, forever, for free. Today, the UC Santa Cruz Genome Browser is the gateway for genomics researchers around the globe.</p>
<p>These audacious contributions &#8212; these products of &#8220;intellectual curiosity&#8221; &#8212; are differentiators for our state. They speak to the vision Californians embraced 50 years ago, when the Master Plan for Higher Education called for tuition-free opportunities at the state&#8217;s community colleges and public universities.</p>
<p>The mission of public higher education is fundamental to our democracy and to our economic vitality. Let&#8217;s bring back the sense of collective responsibility for the university and its students &#8212; a public investment as essential as our hospitals, K-12 schools and highways.</p>
<p>UC alumni must speak up, voice their support for the university, and call on all Californians to follow their lead. We must not turn our back on today&#8217;s &#8212; and tomorrow&#8217;s &#8212; increasingly diverse student population.</p>
