And we have&#8212;in foundational science, in environmentalism, and in humanity.&#8221;<br/><br/>As UC Santa Cruz continues to forge ahead in 2015, the campus will mark its 50th anniversary with a variety of events throughout the year, including exhibits of iconic art and photographs, special activities during the annual Alumni Weekend in April, and a series of events in the fall that will celebrate the campus's roots, demonstrate its growth, and showcase its future. <br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s a golden moment for UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; notes Chancellor Blumenthal.&#160; &#8220;We are celebrating our past and embracing the future. The challenges facing the world demand that we remain in the forefront of research and education.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>When UC Santa Cruz opened in 1965</strong>, it was one of three new University of California campuses that would dramatically expand the opportunities available to California students and researchers. These universities were the answer to California&#8217;s post-war baby boom. &#160;<br/><br/>While the San Diego and Irvine campuses followed a more traditional model, UC Santa Cruz established itself from the beginning as a center of doing things in new and different ways. Modeled on Oxford University in England, UC Santa Cruz was designed as a cluster of decentralized small colleges, where students could have daily contact with their professors, while still being part of a large research university. <br/><br/>&#8220;Our thesis is simple,&#8221; said Dean McHenry, the campus's first chancellor, in 1966. &#8220;In a college setting, where a small number of students and faculty go about their daily business in close proximity, it is just that much more difficult to forget that the students are individual, unexchangeable, irreplaceable human beings.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>Over the past 50 years</strong>, UC Santa Cruz has grown from just 652 students in the first class to more than 17,000 students today. Much has changed, both on campus and in the world at large, but the bold spirit of inquiry and experimentation that characterized UC Santa Cruz from the start continues to foster transformative student experiences and groundbreaking research.<br/><br/>&#8220;As part of celebrating UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s rich history, we are focused on what&#8217;s next,&#8221; notes Chancellor Blumenthal. &#8220;Whether it&#8217;s tackling cancer with genomics and big data, launching the next generation of environmental leaders, or pushing the frontiers of social justice and artistic expression, our eyes are on the future. We&#8217;ve always been&#8211;and will never stop being&#8211;trailblazers.&#8221;</p>

book <i>Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics is Fueling our Modern Plagues</i>, will give a public lecture on Thursday, January 15, at 7 p.m. at the Rio Theater in Santa Cruz. Tickets are free and can be reserved online at <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/our-disappearing-microbes-tickets-13994878057?ref=ebtn">Eventbrite</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Blaser's lecture, "Our Disappearing Microbes," has been organized by the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://www.metx.ucsc.edu">Department of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology</a> to mark the department's 15th anniversary and the 50th anniversary of UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In <i>Missing Microbes</i>, Blaser described how the discovery of antibiotics ushered in a golden age of medicine, and then traced the adverse effects of our subsequent overuse of these seeming wonder drugs. According to Blaser, overuse of antibiotics has contributed to the rise of the "modern plagues" of obesity, asthma, allergies, diabetes, and certain forms of cancer. Blaser's studies suggest antibiotic use during early childhood poses the greatest risk to long-term health, and, alarmingly, American children receive on average about 17 courses of antibiotics before they are twenty years old. In his talk, Blaser will present the evidence in support of his theory and explain what people can do to avoid even more catastrophic health problems in the future.</p>
<p>Dr. Blaser is the George and Muriel Singer Professor of Medicine, Professor of Microbiology, and Director of the Human Microbiome Program at the New York University School of Medicine. He served as chair of the Department of Medicine at NYU from 2000 to 2012. A physician and microbiologist, Dr. Blaser is interested in understanding the relationships we have with our persistently colonizing bacteria. His work over the past 30 years focused on human pathogens, including <i>Campylobacter</i> species and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, which also are model systems for understanding interactions of residential bacteria with their human hosts. Over the last decade, he has been actively studying the relationship of the human microbiome to health and such important diseases as asthma, obesity, diabetes, and allergies.</p>
<p>An elected member of the Institute of Medicine and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Dr. Blaser has served as President of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, Chair of the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Cancer Institute, and Chair of the Advisory Board for Clinical Research of the National Institutes of Health. He currently serves on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.</p>

Throughout the year, watch for billboards around Silicon Valley and San Francisco, and ads in the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> and <em>The Atlantic</em>. It's all part of a major push to increase our visibility at this milestone in campus history.<br/><br/>Special events will roll out all year, beginning with Dress Up Like it's 1965 Day on Thursday, Jan. 15. <br/><br/>I've been looking forward to our 50th anniversary for several years. For me, this anniversary presents an opportunity to connect with the history of the campus, reflect on our achievements, and sharpen our vision of the future. <br/><br/>I arrived here in 1972 as a young assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics, not long out of graduate school at UC San Diego. I was enthused about joining an excellent department at this brash, young campus that wanted to do things differently. As my engagement widened through service to Oakes College and the Academic Senate, my appreciation expanded, as well. <br/><br/>Today, as when I arrived, UC Santa Cruz is a place where people work together across disciplines, org charts, and job titles. Faculty and students work across fields, and people rally around initiatives that reflect our values&#8212;sustainability and the needs of undocumented students, to name just two. <br/><br/>All the while, we have held true to our founding vision. We offer an outstanding undergraduate experience, top-flight programs for graduate students, tremendous opportunities for scholars and researchers across the academic spectrum. <br/><br/>Our 50th anniversary is a tremendous opportunity for current students to take pride in this campus and for alumni to reconnect with UCSC and recall what this place has meant to them. Faculty, too, are very engaged in the anniversary, and it is heartening to see professors young and old reflect on what's important to them about this campus.<br/><br/>Increasing our visibility and building our reputation will position this campus for even greater success in the future. Fiat Slug, indeed! <br/><br/>As the anniversary celebrations unfold, I want to thank the many, many people who have contributed to the planning of this celebration. Faculty, staff, alumni, volunteers, and students have all pitched in to put together a memorable array of events and materials. &#160;<br/><br/>Happy Birthday, UC Santa Cruz! See you at Quarry Plaza next week.<br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bb7059c68072704638f4f222ff16ec05"><name>in-memoriam-raul-altamirano</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Raul Altamirano</title><summary>I write with great sadness about the death of Raul Altamirano, assistant to the registrar and business manager for the Office of the Registrar. </summary><start-date>1420444800000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: Raul Altamirano</display-name><path>/2015/01/in-memoriam-raul-altamirano</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/01/in-memoriam-raul-altamirano</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1420483910033</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1420484438376</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>I write with great sadness about the death of Raul&#160;Altamirano, assistant to the registrar and business manager for the Office of the Registrar. Raul died December 23, at home. He was 47.<br/><br/>Long a member of the campus community, Raul graduated from UCSC in 1990 as an Oakes College student with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. Raul started his career in the Office of the Registrar as a student employee, and joined the campus as an Office of the Registrar staff member in 1990.<br/><br/>Through his various roles in the Office of the Registrar, Raul worked with many across campus. He will be remembered for his dedication and commitment to UCSC as well as his devotion to his family.<br/><br/>Raul, native and lifelong resident of Salinas, is survived by his mother, Margarita Altamirano; sister, Patricia Altamirano; and brothers: Javier Altamirano, Luis Altamirano, and Jesus Altamirano.

<p>Although the initial expectation was to utilize the new addresses for mail and delivery purposes, recent developments have necessitated that we continue to use 1156 High Street. The United States Postal Service (USPS) will only accept addresses into their database if they actually deliver to that address. Since they will still only deliver to the college mailrooms and Mail Services, they will therefore not accept our new addresses. Because there are many businesses that use USPS's database to determine if an address is valid, most of the new addresses will be rejected as invalid. <br/><br/>Please continue to use your Mail Stop plus 1156 High Street as your mailing address. Mail Stops can be found using the SlugMail Locator at <a href="http://cmsmailserv.ucsc.edu/testweb/revised/index.php">http://cmsmailserv.ucsc.edu/testweb/revised/index.php</a>.<br/><br/>The new building addresses may prove useful for providing directions, as Google Maps already has many of the addresses in its database. Over the coming months, student employees will add all new addresses to Google Maps.

<p>The structure and internal motions of the stellar disk of a spiral galaxy hold important keys to understanding the galaxy's formation history. The Andromeda galaxy, also called M31, is the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and the largest in the local group of galaxies.</p>
<p>"In the Andromeda galaxy we have the unique combination of a global yet detailed view of a galaxy similar to our own. We have lots of detail in our own Milky Way, but not the global, external perspective," said Puragra Guhathakurta, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The new study, led by UC Santa Cruz graduate student Claire Dorman and Guhathakurta, combined data from two large surveys of stars in Andromeda, one conducted at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the other using the Hubble Space Telescope. The Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) survey has used the Keck/DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph to measure radial velocities of more than 10,000 individual bright stars in Andromeda. The recently completed Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey provides high-resolution imaging at six different wavelengths for more than half of these stars.</p>
<p>"The high resolution of the Hubble images allows us to separate stars from one another in the crowded disk of Andromeda, and the wide wavelength coverage allows us to subdivide the stars into sub-groups according to their age," said Dorman, who is presenting her findings on Thursday, January 8, at the <a href="http://aas.org/meetings/aas225">winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society</a> in Seattle. The study presents the velocity dispersion of young, intermediate-age, and old stars in the disk of Andromeda, the first such measurement in another galaxy.</p>
<p>Dorman's analysis revealed a clear trend related to stellar age, with the youngest stars showing relatively ordered rotational motion around the center of the Andromeda galaxy, while older stars displayed much more disordered motion. Stars in a "well ordered" population are all moving coherently, with nearly the same velocity, whereas stars in a disordered population have a wider range of velocities, implying a greater spatial dispersion.</p>
<p>"If you could look at the disk edge on, the stars in the well-ordered, coherent population would lie in a very thin plane, whereas the stars in the disordered population would form a much puffier layer," Dorman explained.</p>
<p>The researchers considered different scenarios of galactic disk formation and evolution that could account for their observations. One scenario involves the gradual disturbance of a well-ordered disk of stars as a result of mergers with small satellite galaxies. Previous studies have found evidence of such mergers in tidal streams of stars in the extended halo of Andromeda, which appear to be remnants of cannibalized dwarf galaxies. Stars from those galaxies can also accrete onto the disk, but accretion alone cannot account for the observed increase in velocity dispersion with stellar age, Dorman said.</p>
<p>An alternate scenario involves the formation of the stellar disk from an initially thick, clumpy disk of gas that gradually settled. The oldest stars would then have formed while the gas disk was still in a puffed up and disordered configuration. Over time, the gas disk would have settled into a thinner configuration with more ordered motion, and the youngest stars would then have formed with the disk in a more ordered configuration.</p>
<p>According to Dorman, a combination of these mechanisms could account for the team's observations. "Our findings should motivate theorists to carry out more detailed computer simulations of these scenarios," she said.</p>
<p>The comparison to the Milky Way revealed substantial differences suggesting that Andromeda has had a more violent accretion history in the recent past. "Even the most well ordered Andromeda stars are not as well ordered as the stars in the Milky Way's disk," Dorman said.</p>
<p>In the currently favored "Lambda Cold Dark Matter" paradigm of structure formation in the universe, large galaxies such as Andromeda and the Milky Way are thought to have grown by cannibalizing smaller satellite galaxies and accreting their stars and gas. Cosmologists predict that 70 percent of disks the size of Andromeda's and the Milky Way's should have interacted with at least one sizable satellite in the past 8 billion years. The Milky Way's disk is much too orderly for that to have happened, whereas Andromeda's disk fits the prediction much better.</p>
<p>"In this context, the motion of the stars in Andromeda's disk is more normal, and the Milky Way may simply be an outlier with an unusually quiescent accretion history," Guhathakurta said.</p>

If the parties do not come to an agreement, we anticipate the University of California will announce a plan but for now there is no additional information. The UC is not authorizing a special opportunity for employees to change medical plans at this time.&#160; <br/> <br/> Questions regarding the Sutter Health/Blue Shield contract or finding alternative providers should be directed to Blue Shield at 855-201-2087. Questions about the UC plans can be directed to the UCSC Benefits Office; contact Frank Trueba, Benefits Manager at 459-3573. <br/> </span></span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>Lori Castro, Interim Assistant Vice Chancellor, Staff Human Resources; Pamela Peterson, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Academic Personnel</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c65398cc8072704638f4f2225fd48dbb"><name>dress-like-1965-day</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Dressing up to party down</title><summary>Time to head to the vintage store or rifle through the closet to channel your inner Twiggy—in honor of its upcoming 50th anniversary celebration starting in 2015, UC Santa Cruz is holiding an informal 1965-style dress-up day on January 15. </summary><keywords>Dress Like 1965 Day, Tiffany White Stanton, Mad Men</keywords><start-date>1420704000000</start-date><display-name>Dressing up to party down</display-name><path>/2015/01/dress-like-1965-day</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/01/dress-like-1965-day</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1420666574959</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1420761543312</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>50 years</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email>dwhite1@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/dress-up-day-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/dress-up-day-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dress-up-day-1.jpg</name><display-name>dress-up-day-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>133087</file-size><width>400</width><height>225</height></image><image-alt>Dress Like 1965 Day image</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/dress-up-day-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/dress-up-day-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dress-up-day-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>dress-up-day-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27559</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Dress Like 1965 Day image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Photos courtesy of UC Santa Cruz Special Collections</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC Santa Cruz throws 'Dress Like 1965 Day' to kick off year-long celebration of campus's 50th anniversary</article-subhead><article-text><p>It's time for people to head out to the nearest vintage store or rifle through their closets to channel their inner Twiggy.</p>
<p>In honor of its 50th anniversary celebration beginning this month, UC Santa Cruz is getting the party started on January 15 with informal 1965-style dress-up day on campus, harkening back to the days when Twiggy the supermodel wore cape-jacketed suits. This was the time when a bold fashion statement for women was showing up to work in pants instead of a skirt.</p>
<p><strong>Dress Like 1965 Day</strong> takes place on campus from <strong>noon to 2 p.m. January 15 at Quarry Plaza,</strong> where a professional photographer will snap shots of the participants, who will vie for the honor of best outfit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, people looking for inside advice may <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/">visit the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary website</a> or follow UC Santa Cruz social media channels for <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/kick-off/tips.html">hot tips</a> from alumna and <i>Mad Men</i> Co-Costume Designer <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/10/review-fall-2010-madmen.html">Tiffany White Stanton</a> (Kresge '03, psychology). Participants can share their "look" by hashtagging their photos <b>#ucsc50</b>.</p>
<p>The winners&#8212;chosen by Stanton&#8212;will be featured in the <a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz alumni magazine</a> and on campus social media channels. KZSC will be on site broadcasting live and spinning tunes from 1965.</p>
<p>On that special day, a Throwback Thursday, no less, UC Santa Cruz Dining Services will roll out special menu items based on 1965 classics, such as pigs in a blanket, Jell-O with Cool Whip, and Hurricane Punch mocktails.</p>
<p>Those who wish to emulate the vintage 1965 fashions should just keep in mind that the Summer of Love and wild hippie accessories and clothes had not yet burst upon the scene. Take it from Meg Zweiback (Merrill '69, politics), a pioneer alumna who entered UC Santa Cruz as a first-year student that year.</p>
<p>"That year, people were wearing conservative kinds of things," recalled Zweiback, who is now a pediatric nurse practitioner and author. "Right now, as I'm talking to you, I am looking at all the pictures of the girls and boys in the yearbook. All the girls are all in Peter Pan collars and cardigan sweaters. The girls had hairdos called flips&#8212;straight and curled up at the sides. There is no hint of anything other than just 'regular kids.' But that doesn't mean that they stayed that way throughout the 1960s!"</p>
<p>Gabriel Carlos ('15 Kresge, film production/art photography) is one of the students who is helping to get the word out. He is member of <a href="http://slugstyle.tumblr.com/">UC Santa Cruz Street Style</a>, a collective of fashion fans, designers, and photographers who celebrate styles and attitudes on campus.</p>
<p>Carlos said the dress-up day will give all participating students an enjoyable and not overly difficult project. In fact, some UC Santa Cruz students can just go on wearing what they wear on any given day and still fit right in.</p>
<p>"It's really funny because the 1960s has a lot of influence over current street style," he said.&#160;</p>
<p>Those who wish to complete their 1960s look could study <a href="http://digitalcollections.ucsc.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/p265101coll25">archival photos</a> from the early days of UC Santa Cruz, or just explore various fashion sites online.</p>
<p>In that part of the decade "there were a lot of polka dots, a lot of cat's eye sunglasses, and these kind of cotton-candy colors," said Carlos, adding that dress-up day participants could easily improvise the distinctive straight lines and "clean silhouettes" of the outfits.</p>
<p>"Women could pick up an oversized dress, cut down the sleeves, and put it over an undershirt," he said. "The styles are really accessible."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2015/01/50-news-release</path><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Research</value><value>Academics</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value><value>Feature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2015/01/50-news-release</link><site>news</site><name>50-news-release</name><display-name>50 amazing years</display-name><title>UC Santa Cruz turns 50, a bold experiment realized </title><summary>In 1965, UC President Clark Kerr described the brand new campus at Santa Cruz as “the most significant educational experiment in the history of the University of California.”&#13;

The title of the first event, &#8216;Making the Cosmos Local,&#8217; captures the spirit of this series which is to bring big questions to the Santa Cruz commons.&#8221;<br/><br/>Another important element of the series is to bring thinkers from different fields, revealing that scholars in different areas of study at the university are working on the same problems and questions, often from very different perspectives.<br/><br/>&#8220;We think it will be illuminating and exciting for people to participate in a conversation with these scholars as they work publicly and collaboratively on some of these questions,&#8221; said Deutsch. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to break down barriers between the town and the university.&#8221;<br/><br/>Associate IHR director Irena Polic added that one of the goals of the Institute for Humanities Research is to partner with local Santa Cruz institutions such as Bookshop Santa Cruz, Kuumbwa Jazz Center, and the public libraries to highlight that these are all big cultural institutions in the city. <br/><br/>&#8220;The more collaboration there is, the more interesting it becomes. It creates a synergy that becomes more compelling,&#8221; said Polic. &#8220;The university should not be seen as an ivory tower on the hill, but rather as an organic partner in the community.&#8220;&#160; <br/>_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/><em>&#8220;Making the Cosmos Local&#8221; takes place on Tuesday, January 27, at Kuumbwa Jazz Center in Santa Cruz.

<p>Davis is the author of nine books, including her most recent book of essays, <i>The Meaning of Freedom.</i></p>
<p>The topic of her talk will be "Racism, Militarism, Poverty: From Ferguson to Palestine." The convocation begins at 7 p.m., Wednesday, January 28, at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. The event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Davis is the latest in a long line of distinguished speakers at the convocation: among them, Anna Deavere Smith, poet and activist Nikki Giovanni, former congressman and former NAACP chairman Kweisi Mfume, Harvard professor Cornel West, and bestselling author Alice Walker.</p>
<p>One of the highest-profile faculty members at UC Santa Cruz, she was a professor in history of consciousness and feminist studies from 1991 to 2008, when she retired.</p>
<p>For many years she has been a highly outspoken organizer and activist. A determined critic of the United States prison system, she helped popularize the term "prison industrial complex." In her speeches, she often asks her audiences to think seriously about the possibility of a world without prison.</p>
<p>She is also a champion of literacy as a means to achieve social equality. During a recent conversation with <i>UC Santa Cruz Review</i> magazine, she talked about her experiences in jail after being placed on the FBI's "10 Most Wanted List."</p>
<p>"The only way one can live a life that is not subject to the strictures of incarceration is to live a life of the mind," she said. "It was interesting when I went to jail, I realized that having been in school for so long and having spent so much time alone reading, I could actually rescue myself from the repression of the jail by engaging in those passages.</p>
<p>"The selection in the jail library was always so limited, and when I was able to get books from the outside I always tried to share those books with other women who were there. I was prevented from sharing them, but we figured out ways to circulate them. Books were contraband."</p>
<p>One of those hidden books was <i>Soledad Brother: The Prison Letters of George Jackson</i>. "We managed to read that book clandestinely," Davis said. "We had organized discussions about it."</p>
<p>Davis reflected on her jail experiences in her book, <i>Angela Davis: An Autobiography</i>. Writing this memoir was not her idea; the Nobel and Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning author Toni Morrison, while working as an editor at Random House, approached Davis with the idea and worked on the book with her. The two have been friends ever since; Davis was on hand to introduce Toni Morrison when Morrison gave a lecture in Santa Cruz this past fall, prior to accepting the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal.</p>
<p>The convocation also includes the announcement of the annual Tony Hill Memorial Award, honoring a community member who is actively engaged in the needs of the community and seeks to provide tools to work toward a solution. The individual demonstrates hands-on service that results in building connections among diverse groups, promoting equality and justice.</p>
<p>Honorees exemplify the late Tony Hill's work and legacy. Hill, a longtime advocate for social and economic justice in Santa Cruz County, was known for his skills as a community bridge-builder and mediator. He died in 2007 at age 62. Award recipients receive $500 to donate to the charity of his or her choice.</p>
<p>Past honorees include Theresa "Gina" Casta&#241;eda, deputy probation officer for Santa Cruz County and head coach of the Aztecas soccer team, whose young players are "high risk" youth including a number of gang-involved teens; Deutron Kebebew, youth advocate and former foster child; and Stephen Nelson of the Homeless Services Center.</p>

She was 74.</p>
<p>A noted seismologist and geophysicist, McNally was a leading authority on earthquake mechanisms and risk assessment. Born in Clovis, CA, she earned her B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees in geophysics at UC Berkeley and worked with the late Charles F. Richter at the California Institute of Technology before joining the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1981.</p>
<p>McNally was director of the Richter Seismological Laboratory at UC Santa Cruz in 1989 when the Loma Prieta earthquake struck, killing 57 people and causing severe damage in Santa Cruz and the San Francisco Bay Area. Having recognized two earlier temblors in the region as possible precursors to a large earthquake, McNally had installed seismic instruments in the area where the San Andreas fault ruptured on October 17, 1989. Thanks in part to her efforts, the seismological recordings of the Loma Prieta earthquake and its aftershocks were the best that had ever been obtained for a large continental earthquake, and scientists were able to learn a great deal about the faults in the area and the factors that contribute to damaging ground shaking during an earthquake.</p>
<p>McNally spent much of her career working in Costa Rica, where she helped establish a modern geophysical observatory and develop the country's program for earthquake hazard reduction. One of the most earthquake-prone and volcanically active countries in the world, Costa Rica had no ongoing nationwide seismic monitoring system until McNally helped establish a national seismographic network in 1984. In 2004, the National University of Costa Rica awarded her the University Medal for her contributions.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, McNally founded the Institute of Tectonics and helped establish a strong research program in seismology. "She had an incredible sense of knowing who to bring and how to build a great program to really put Santa Cruz on the map as far as seismology research," said Susan Schwartz, professor of Earth and planetary sciences and director of the Keck Seismology Laboratory at UC Santa Cruz. "Her work in Costa Rica was also important, not only in establishing the national network there but also in laying the groundwork for ongoing collaborations between UCSC faculty and researchers in Costa Rica, many of whom earned their Ph.D. degrees at UC Santa Cruz."</p>
<p>McNally served on the board of directors for the Seismological Society of America, as well as for the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS). She also served on the California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council, which advises the governor's office and the Office of Emergency Services, and on numerous committees for the National Academy of Sciences, NASA, and the U.S. Geological Survey.</p>
<p>McNally's survivors include daughters Kim Cook of New Orleans and Meredith Hurley of San Luis Obispo, CA; brother Jerry Einar Cook of Clovis and sister Jean Howard Brown of Novato CA; and three grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be sent to UCSF, PO Box 45339, San Francisco, CA 94145 (checks payable to the UCSF Foundation and indicate B0831 in memory of Dr. Karen McNally).

<p>Nearly 55,000 prospective undergraduates applied for the fall 2015 quarter, an 11 percent increase from the previous year, and the second highest percentage increase among the UC campuses.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz attracted a record 45,534 applications from high school seniors and 8,799 applications from transfer students&#8211;also an all-time high&#8211;during the application cycle that closed Nov. 30, according to data released today by UC's Office of the President.</p>
<p>"As the campus begins a year-long celebration of its 50th anniversary, it's fantastic to see interest in UC Santa Cruz reaching these levels," said Michael McCawley, director of admissions. "Students from California and around the world now know UC Santa Cruz will both prepare them for the next phase of their lives, while also offering opportunities for personal growth."</p>
<p>The campus saw a 10 percent increase in the number of California high school seniors applying, the second-highest percentage increase in the University of California. Interest continues to increase from out-of-state students with a 17.9 percent increase and a systemwide high of 26.1 percent increase for international students. Additionally, California transfer student applications grew by 6 percent, international applications increased by 26.7 percent, and out-of-state transfer applications remained unchanged from the previous year.</p>
<p>The ethnic diversity of California applicants also increased. The campus received more freshman applications this year than last from African Americans (up by 6.9 percent), American Indians (up by 3 percent), Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (up by 7.6 percent), and Chicanos/Latinos (up by 14.5 percent), continuing its recent trend. UC Santa Cruz was <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/top-colleges-hispanics.html">recently listed</a> by BestColleges.com as first among the top 50 colleges for Hispanic students.</p>
<p>"Ensuring we continue to attract and enroll students both locally and from around the world enriches the educational and cultural experience for all undergraduate students," McCawley said. "A UC Santa Cruz graduate will be well prepared to compete in today's global society, whether working for a tech company in Silicon Valley or sharing sustainable farming methods abroad.</p>
<p>"Our faculty, alumni, students, and staff have all played an important role in achieving these successful application numbers," McCawley said. "Prospective students and their families often come into contact with members of our campus community and our alumni, and because of those interactions, they decide to apply."</p>
<p>The campus is planning to enroll 1,125 new transfers, on par with this year, and 3,200 to 3,500 first-year students for the coming year, roughly 500 to 700 fewer than it did in fall 2014, in large part due to the very large incoming class this year, according to Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway.</p>
<p>"We will be reducing our enrollment to better align with current funding to ensure we do not compromise quality," Galloway said. "As a result, UC Santa Cruz will be more selective than ever before."</p>
<p>Undergraduate applicants will be notified of admission decisions beginning mid-March. Admitted first-year students have until May 1 to indicate their intent to enroll and transfers until June 1.</p>
<p>Final numbers for graduate student applications to UC Santa Cruz will not be available until after January 15. Last year, the campus received a record high number of graduate applications, and is tracking as well or better than last year.</p>
<p>"We offer an outstanding undergraduate experience, top-flight programs for graduate students, and tremendous opportunities for scholars and researchers across the academic spectrum," Chancellor George Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>This year the campus is <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu">celebrating its 50th anniversary</a> with a series of events and lectures. UC Santa Cruz opened September 27, 1965 with 652 students and has grown to more than 16,000 undergraduate and post-graduate students. Then-UC President Clark Kerr noted Santa Cruz as "the most significant educational experiment in the history of the University of California."</p>
<p>The experiment has been a success. Since opening 50 years ago, UC Santa Cruz has built an international reputation with its academic accomplishments and research discoveries in areas such as astrophysics, organic farming, oceanography, human rights, genomics, and cancer research.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/THE-ranking.html">ranks first</a> in the world for the impact of its research as measured by the average number of times its faculty's published work is cited by scholars around the world, according to a survey published by <em>Times Higher Education.</em></p>
<p>It also ranks first in the nation for the publication impact of the computer engineering Ph.D. program, by the National Research Council. Additionally, alumni have gone on to win six Pulitzer Prizes and five MacArthur "Genius" Awards.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e032a62a8072704673793532b8014c78"><name>cowell-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The library is the heart of the campus</title><summary>By Elizabeth Cowell, University Librarian — The library is the heart of the campus.”&#13;

<p>And why not? The library is a welcoming space, a repository of scholarship that speaks to the preservation of knowledge and the core of the college experience: studying, learning, exploration, and discovery. It&#8217;s an icon.<br/><br/>I don&#8217;t disagree with this. I love the library, too. But I&#8217;d like to challenge you to think of the heart in another way.</p>
<p><img alt="Campus map with heart (literally)" height="540" src="images/heart_library-720.jpg" width="720"/><br/>(Images by Barbara Taylor)</p>
<p>Coming from a family of medical practitioners, I see the library as a vital organ of the campus. People and information come in, and value is added and redistributed throughout the campus. It is an integral part of the academic circulatory system.<br/><br/><strong>Transforming the student experience</strong><br/><br/>The renovation and expansion of McHenry Library has been a tremendous success, in large part because the new space gives students, faculty, and staff a place to come together across disciplines. Gate counts are up more than 70 percent since the reopening&#8212;without a drop in visitors to the Science &amp; Engineering Library. &#160;</p>
<p>Now, we want to do more. Our top priority for the comprehensive fundraising campaign is to renovate the Science &amp; Engineering Library. Our initial assessment shows that students want a variety of study spaces ranging from silent study to group-study rooms. Students also want peer-to-peer services, more online content, robust connectivity&#8212;and lots more electrical outlets. Building on the success of the Global Village Caf&#233; in McHenry, our plans include food service.</p>
<p><strong>Partners in research and teaching</strong></p>
<p>We have also reached out to faculty. Last spring, we asked faculty about a range of topics, including information discovery, undergraduate research skills, the role of the library, open access and scholarly communication, and data management.</p>
<p>The survey yielded an impressive response rate of 28 percent; one finding stands out: Most respondents said they create data, and most said the number-one place they store it is on their own computer. We in the library have tremendous resources to help faculty manage their data, and we will begin rolling out new services this quarter.</p>
<p>Regarding open access, the UC Academic Senate last year passed an open-access policy that requires faculty to deposit their articles in eScholarship, the UC repository. We are hosting informational sessions and are preparing to support the policy as UCSC begins implementation.&#160; Library staff will upload articles on behalf of interested faculty beginning this quarter. Stay tuned for more information.</p>
<p>We are also partnering with Undergraduate Education, Student Affairs, and faculty to support student success. University-level library research is a new concept for many of our students, and we have developed a host of orientation programs to help undergraduates.</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p>
<p>For all that we have accomplished, our aspirations remain high. Our priorities for the future include acquiring materials that support the curriculum and research, experimenting with ways to control costs, as well as collaborating with other UC libraries and libraries nationally.</p>
<p>In sum, the Library is a vital organ of the campus, adding value across the academic enterprise of UC Santa Cruz. &#160;<br/><br/>&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e46d4a8c80727046737935329e0df0a4"><name>genome-variation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz to lead effort to build a new map of human genetic variation</title><summary>The Simons Foundation awarded UCSC up to $1 million to develop a comprehensive Human Genome Variation Map for scientific and medical research</summary><keywords>Genomics Institute,  Benedict Paten, David Haussler, Human Genome Variation Map, HGVM, reference genome</keywords><start-date>1421136000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz to lead effort to build a new map of human genetic variation</display-name><path>/2015/01/genome-variation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/01/genome-variation</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1421171575371</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1421255740682</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/figure-5001.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/figure-5001.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>figure-5001.jpg</name><display-name>figure-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>83355</file-size><width>500</width><height>233</height></image><image-alt>genome variation map</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/figure-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/figure-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>figure-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>figure-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26644</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>genome variation map</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The Human Genome Variation Map will represent variants as alternate paths along the genome, formalized as a very large mathematical graph.

The Human Genome Variation Map will be a critical new resource for both medical research and basic research in the life sciences.</p>
<p>The one-year pilot project aims to overcome the limitations of the current model for analyzing human genome data, which is based on the use of a single reference sequence for the human genome. Essentially, all novel sequencing data is analyzed by mapping new genome sequences to this one reference set of 24 human chromosomes to identify variants. But this approach leads to biases and mapping ambiguities, and some variants simply cannot be described with respect to the reference genome, according to David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the Genomics Institute at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"One exemplary human genome cannot represent humanity as a whole, and the scientific community has not been able to agree on a single precise method to refer to and represent human genome variants. There is a great deal we still don't know about human genetic variation because of these problems," said Haussler, who will lead the project with co-investigator Benedict Paten, a research scientist at the Genomics Institute.</p>
<p><strong>"Tower of Babel"</strong></p>
<p>According to Paten, the proliferation of different genomic databases has resulted in hundreds of specialized coordinate systems and nomenclatures for describing human genetic variation. UC Santa Cruz genomics researchers are intimately familiar with this "Tower of Babel" of databases through their work to display data from all these sources on the widely used UCSC Genome Browser. Launched in July 2000 shortly after UC Santa Cruz posted the first working draft of the human genome sequence on the Internet, the browser now serves 130,000 researchers around the world and gets more than 1 million web page requests per day.</p>
<p>"For now, all our browser staff can do is to serve the data from these disparate sources in their native, mutually incompatible formats," Paten said. "This lack of comprehensive integration, coupled with the over-simplicity of the reference model, seriously impedes progress in the science of genomics and its use in medicine."</p>
<p>Recently, with funding from the Simons Foundation, researchers David Reich and Nick Patterson at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard have amassed more than 300 complete human genome sequences representing a range of ethnicities. Haussler and Paten plan to use this set of human genomes, which they say is deeper and more completely organized than any prior human data set, to build a new graph-based human reference genome structure.</p>
<p>"This unique data set of genome diversity gives us an opportunity to define a comprehensive reference genome structure that can be truly representative of human variation. Eventually, we will want to expand it to include many more genomes, but this pilot project will focus on building a map structure based on the Reich-Patterson data set," Paten said.</p>
<p>The new Human Genome Variation Map will replace the current snarl of isolated, incompatible databases of human genetic variation with a single, fundamental representation formalized as a very large mathematical graph. The clean mathematical formulation is a major strength of this new approach, Paten said.</p>
<p>The primary reference genome is a linear sequence of DNA bases (represented by the letters A, C, T, and G). To build the Human Genome Variation Map, each new genome will be merged into the reference genome at the points where it matches the primary sequence, with variations appearing as additional alternate paths along the genome. The resulting map will include all forms of human genome variation.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Global Alliance</strong></p>
<p>The project dovetails with Haussler's efforts as a leader of the <a href="http://genomicsandhealth.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics &amp; Health</a> (GA4GH), which involves more than 200 collaborating institutions that have agreed to work together to enable secure sharing of genomic and clinical data. The overall vision of the global alliance includes a genomics platform consisting of something akin to the planned Human Genome Variation Map, along with open-source software tools to enable researchers to mine the data for new scientific and medical breakthroughs.</p>
<p>The pilot project funded by the Simons Foundation grant is an essential first step in achieving this goal. The UC Santa Cruz team will collaborate with leading genomics researchers at other institutions to develop algorithms and formulate the best mathematical approach for constructing the Human Genome Variation Map. Initial work on developing a standard data model for the map is already under way in the context of the GA4GH <a href="http://ga4gh.org/#/refvar-team">Reference Variation Task Team</a> co-chaired by Paten.</p>
<p>"We are bringing together the best people in the world to create and test different approaches for constructing the map. The first six months will be spent testing different algorithms on the trickiest regions of the genome," Paten said.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, he expects to have a draft Human Genome Variation Map based on the full set of genomes. Paten and Haussler have also outlined the follow-up activities needed to extend the pilot project and fully realize their vision for the new map. Collaborators include scientists at major biomedical research institutions such as the Broad Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, UC San Francisco, Oxford University, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in the U.K., and the European Bioinformatics Institute.</p>
<p>For medical researchers, the new map will make it easier to detect and analyze both simple and genomically complex variants that contribute to conditions that have a hereditary component, such as autism and diabetes. The map will also be a valuable tool for understanding recent human evolution, including the evolution and contribution to human diversity of hard-to-map DNA sequences such as mobile DNA elements.</p>

<p>Organizers expect 250 students to attend the three-day conference, where they will learn about graduate school and career opportunities in physics and network with other female physicists. Hosted by the UCSC Department of Physics, the Santa Cruz event is one of eight regional conferences across the nation organized by the American Physical Society.</p>
<p>"UC Santa Cruz is by far the biggest regional conference this year. We had more applicants than we could accommodate and had to redirect some to other sites," said Tesla Jeltema, assistant professor of physics and faculty chair of the organizing committee for the conference at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Jeltema said students are coming from as far away as Alaska, Hawaii, and British Columbia to attend the conference. "One of the goals is to expose them to the range of careers that a physics degree is useful for," she said. "They'll hear from successful women in physics and find out what they're doing and how they got where they are."</p>
<p>Angie Wolfgang, a UCSC graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics who helped organize the conference, said the opportunity to meet a lot of other women who are interested in physics is one of the most important aspects of the conference, because the number of women studying physics is relatively small at most institutions.</p>
<p>"It's an awesome experience to be surrounded by other women who are excited about physics and are doing interesting research," Wolfgang said. "There will be talks by industry professionals and other female physicists who can provide career advice and serve as inspirational role models."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Making connections</strong></p>
<p>In addition to talks by senior physicists, most of the conference will involve workshops and small group activities, as well as lab tours and opportunities for students to present their own research. A number of activities are designed to get participants to meet and talk to as many people as possible. "We hope they'll make lots of connections and keep in touch after the meeting," Jeltema said.</p>
<p>Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, will welcome the attendees on Saturday morning and talk about ongoing efforts at UC Santa Cruz to support diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Katie Hellier, who earned her physics degree at UCSC in 2014 and is currently a lab manager for UCSC physics professor Sue Carter, led a large group of undergraduate and graduate students who have been working for several months to organize the conference. In addition to Jeltema and Hellier, the local organizing committee includes physics professor Michael Dine; graduate students Emma Storm, Angie Wolfgang, Brendan Wells, Devon Hollowood, Caitlin Johnson, Amitta Kutner, Kat Feng, Tiffany Hsyu, and Camille Leibler; undergraduates Tanmayi Sai, Monique Windju, Athena Gallagos, Sophia Rocco, Sydney Weiser, and Lydia Seymour; postdoctoral researcher Regina Caputo; and staff members Sissy Madden and Mykell Discipulo.</p>
<p>This is the second time UC Santa Cruz has hosted one of the regional conferences. The National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy provide funding for the conferences through the American Physical Society. Most of the funding for hosting the event, however, has come from campus sources and private donations. Campus sponsors include the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, Graduate Division, Physics Department, Astronomy and Astrophysics Department, and Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Other sponsors include the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, David and Lucile Packard Foundation, UCSC Science Internship Program, and Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>01-19-2015</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ee8c3b6380727046737935321415c10f"><name>dive-response</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Heart arrhythmias detected in deep-diving marine mammals </title><summary>Exercising while holding their breath remains a physiological challenge for marine mammals, despite remarkable adaptations to aquatic life.</summary><keywords>dive response, mammalian dive response, dive reflex, Weddell seals, marine mammals</keywords><start-date>1421402400000</start-date><display-name>Heart arrhythmias detected in deep-diving marine mammals </display-name><path>/2015/01/dive-response</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/01/dive-response</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1421341375273</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1421424813954</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/seal-art-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/seal-art-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>seal-art-450.jpg</name><display-name>seal-art-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>69904</file-size><width>450</width><height>338</height></image><image-alt>seal chasing fish</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/seal-art-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/seal-art-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>seal-art-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>seal-art-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23978</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>seal chasing fish</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>When hunting fish beneath the Antarctic sea ice, Weddell seals alternate between easy glides and short chases in pursuit of prey.

Williams)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Cardiac variability during intense underwater exercise challenges the physiological dive response in marine mammals</article-subhead><article-text><p>A new study of dolphins and seals shows that despite their remarkable adaptations to aquatic life, exercising while holding their breath remains a physiological challenge for marine mammals. The study, published January 16 in <i>Nature Communications,</i> found a surprisingly high frequency of heart arrhythmias in bottlenose dolphins and Weddell seals during the deepest dives.</p>
<p>The normal dive response in marine mammals has long been understood to involve a marked reduction in heart rate (called bradycardia) and other physiological changes to conserve limited oxygen reserves while the air-breathing animals are underwater. How marine mammals cope with the exertion needed to pursue prey at depth has been unclear, however, since the normal physiological response to exercise is an increase in heart rate (called tachycardia). The new study shows that these conflicting signals to the heart can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, said lead author Terrie Williams, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"This study changes our understanding of bradycardia in marine mammals," Williams said. "The heart is receiving conflicting signals when the animals exercise intensely at depth, which often happens when they are starting their ascent. We're not seeing lethal arrhythmias, but it is putting the heart in an unsteady state that could make it vulnerable to problems."</p>
<p>Instead of a single level of reduced heart rate during dives, the researchers found that heart rates of diving animals varied with both depth and exercise intensity, sometimes alternating rapidly between periods of bradycardia and tachycardia. Cardiac arrhythmias occurred in more than 70 percent of deep dives.</p>
<p>"We tend to think of marine mammals as completely adapted to life in the water. However, in terms of the dive response and heart rate, it's not a perfect system," Williams said. "Even 50 million years of evolution hasn't been able to make that basic mammalian response impervious to problems."</p>
<p><strong>Neural circuits</strong></p>
<p>The conflict between dive-induced bradycardia and exercise-induced tachycardia involves two different neural circuits that regulate heart rates, she said. The sympathetic nervous system stimulates the heart during exercise, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system controls the slowing of the heart rate during the dive response.</p>
<p>The new findings have implications for efforts to understand stranding events involving deep-diving marine mammals such as beaked whales. The authors note that the behaviors associated with cardiac anomalies in this study (increased physical exertion, deep diving, and rapid ascent from depth) are the same as those involved in the flight response of beaked whales and blue whales exposed to shipping noise and mid-frequency sonars.</p>
<p>"This study is not saying that these deep-diving animals will die if they exercise hard at depth," Williams said. "Rather, it raises questions about what happens physiologically when extreme divers are disturbed during a dive, and it needs further investigation."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Triathletes</strong></p>
<p>The study's findings may also be relevant in humans, she said. The mammalian dive response or dive reflex, though most pronounced in marine mammals, also occurs in humans and other terrestrial animals and is triggered when the face contacts cold water. A 2010 study of triathlons found that the swimming segment of cold water triathlons accounts for over 90 percent of race day deaths. "It may be that the same conflicting signals we saw in dolphins and seals are causing arrhythmias in some triathletes," Williams said. She is currently working with triathlon groups to help mitigate such problems during races.</p>
<p>To conduct the study, the researchers developed a monitoring device to record heart rate, swimming stroke frequency, depth, and time throughout the dives of trained bottlenose dolphins diving in pools or open water, as well as free-ranging Weddell seals swimming beneath the ice in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Williams said the animals typically used low-intensity swimming modes as much as possible during dives. When hunting fish beneath the ice, Weddell seals alternated between easy glides and short chases in pursuit of prey. This behavior appeared to enable the marine mammals to avoid cardiac conflicts and associated arrhythmias during hunting.</p>
<p>In addition to Williams, the study's coauthors include Tracy Kendall, Beau Richter, Shawn Noren, and Nicole Thometz at UC Santa Cruz; Lee Fuiman and Edward Farrell at the University of Texas at Austin; Patrick Berry and Andy Stamper at the Seas-Walt Disney World Resorts in Florida; Michael Shattock at St. Thomas' Hospital, London; and Randall Davis at Texas A&amp;M University.

is a curatorial class&#8212;it&#8217;s a great atmosphere to experiment,&#8221; Tom Franco told the 20 students gathered at their first meeting in the Sesnon Gallery at UC Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>The 34-year-old Berkeley artist was on campus to help co-teach a 10-week class called <em>Curatorial Practice</em> with gallery director Shelby Graham.<br/>&#160;<br/>A UC Santa Cruz alum (he graduated with a B.A. in Fine Art-Sculpture in 2002), Franco is also the founder and director of the Firehouse Art Collective, a pioneering nonprofit that is changing the arts community in the East Bay. <br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s a community; it&#8217;s physical spaces,&#8221; explained Franco. &#8220;We rent out spaces and sublet to artists for living, performance, galleries, storefronts...what we create is the artists&#8217; lifestyle. We have about 100 artists who rent from us monthly, not counting those who do an event.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Everything we do, it&#8217;s art that ties it together.&#8221; <br/><br/>Established in 2005, the collective currently has four spaces in Berkeley, and one in Oakland. &#8220;One space is residential, the living room is the gallery,&#8221; Franco noted. <br/><br/><strong>Collaboration is the key to Franco&#8217;s life</strong>&#8212;working together with other artists and helping to create environments to make art happen. <br/><br/>&#8220;My family&#8217;s very artistic,&#8221; said Franco, whose parents both were painting majors at Stanford. In his teens, he took art classes after school at night in Palo Alto with his brother James, who went on to become a famous actor. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of pressure to perform and do something, because he&#8217;s so successful,&#8221; Franco noted.<br/><br/>&#8220;For James, acting was his passion in art. For me, acting is great. I really enjoy it. I was in a theater dance group for six years. But sculpture is how my brain works. I have to pursue it. It&#8217;s my strongest voice.&#8221; <br/><br/>His work as a sculptor and painter eventually became the foundation for the &#8220;Tom Franco Co-Lab&#8221;&#8212;a project focused entirely on works created in tandem with one or more artists.&#160; &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Franco was able to reconnect with UC Santa Cruz</strong> a little over a year ago, when campus alumni held an open mic event at one of his collective&#8217;s spaces in the Bay Area. He said the Santa Cruz campus&#8212;and the facilities&#8212;gave him ample time to explore his interest in art. <br/><br/>&#8220;I loved how the smaller colleges at UC Santa Cruz made it a tighter community so you could have close friendships,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;I did some painting, sculpture, and worked in the metal welding shop. It&#8217;s metal welding that was my love. The experience of having a full shop with all of the equipment was great. I haven&#8217;t had a shop experience like that since,&#8221; he added. <br/><br/>After hosting the alumni event, he agreed to do a mini-version of the collaborative Firehouse Collective at the university. As a result, he&#8217;s bringing a number of other artists with him to campus this quarter, many of them also UCSC alums. They will work with students and help present an array of <a href="http://art.ucsc.edu/galleries/sesnon/current"><em><strong>events</strong></em></a>--ranging from film screenings to concerts featuring live painters and videographers. <br/><br/><strong>Franco will also give a <a href="http://art.ucsc.edu/galleries/sesnon/current">free public lecture</a> on Feb. 5</strong> at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Music Center Recital Hall titled &#8220;The Artist Community Collaborative Experience.&#8221; His talk kicks off the opening of the Tom Franco Co-Lab <a href="http://art.ucsc.edu/galleries/sesnon/current"><em><strong>exhibition</strong></em></a> at the Sesnon Gallery, which will run until March 13. <br/><br/>&#8220;We&#8217;re taking the Firehouse Collective on the road,&#8221; said Franco. &#8221;I like to think of doing visual art as a band of performers. We create a collaborative scene that mimics what a performance artist would experience working with a group, an ensemble, or a film.&#8221;<br/><br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f382121b80727046737935329941497d"><name>claire-max-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz astronomer Claire Max recognized for astronomical instrumentation</title><summary>The American Astronomical Society awarded the Joseph Weber Award for Astronomical Instrumentation to UC Observatories director Claire Max.</summary><keywords>UCO, UC Observatories, Claire Max</keywords><start-date>1421395200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz astronomer Claire Max recognized for astronomical instrumentation</display-name><path>/2015/01/claire-max-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/01/claire-max-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1421424595377</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1422387700687</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/claire-max.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/claire-max.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>claire-max.jpg</name><display-name>claire-max.jpg</display-name><file-size>103737</file-size><width>222</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Claire Max</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/claire-max-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/claire-max-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>claire-max-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>claire-max-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22674</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Claire Max</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Claire Max</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The American Astronomical Society (AAS) has awarded the 2015 Joseph Weber Award for Astronomical Instrumentation to Max, director of UC Observatories</article-subhead><article-text><p>Claire Max, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and director of <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/">UC Observatories</a>, was awarded the American Astronomical Society's 2015 Joseph Weber Award for Astronomical Instrumentation at the <a href="http://aas.org/meetings/aas225">AAS winter meeting</a> in Seattle.</p>
<p>Max is a pioneer in the field of adaptive optics, a technology that removes the blurring effects of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere, allowing telescopes on the ground to see as clearly as if they were in space. A co-inventor of the laser guide star technique for astronomical adaptive optics, she has helped revolutionize the capabilities of ground-based telescopes. Max has served as director of the Center for Adaptive Optics at UC Santa Cruz, and in June 2014 she was appointed director of UC Observatories on an interim basis.</p>
<p>"Claire Max has continually pushed the technological envelope, which has enabled ground-based telescopes to have the crystal clear vision that would otherwise be available only in outer space. Her work has touched not just astronomy, but has also had important consequences for improved imaging of objects ranging from satellites to the inside of the human eye," said Greg Laughlin, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In a citation accompanying the Joseph Weber Award, the AAS recognized Max "for co-inventing sodium laser guide star adaptive optics and for shepherding adaptive optics from its roots in classified space surveillance to its prominence today as an essential technology on large telescopes. Her leadership has truly advanced the field of adaptive optics and transformed how we observe by making near diffraction-limited imaging possible on large telescopes, thus opening new fields of discovery including resolving stars and gas near supermassive black holes and studying extrasolar planets."</p>
<p>Max has received many awards and honors for her accomplishments in astronomy and physics. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Physical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She received the U.S. Department of Energy's E. O. Lawrence Award in Physics in 2004. Max joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1999.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb

festivities</article-subhead><article-text><p>Students, staff, and faculty wore scarves and skinny ties, Peter Pan collars, gloves and fedoras, coats and dresses with bold geometric patterns, and hornrim glasses.</p>
<p>As it reached a critical mass of people and intensity, "<a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/kick-off/">Dress Like It's 1965 Day</a>," an event kicking off UC Santa Cruz's ongoing 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations, drew more than 200 people, some of them dancing the pony, the twist, the frug, or some strange combination of the three while British Invasion bands blasted in the background.</p>
<p>Women went all out with big "bump" and beehive hairdos, held together with an eye-watering amount of hairspray. Check out some highlights on <a href="http://instagram.com/ucsc">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://tagboard.com/ucsc50/search">Tagboard</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>While some went for a formal 1960s look with dark suits or pastels and pearls, others embraced a more wild and bold approach for the noontime party in Quarry Plaza. Ellie Stayner (College Eight '17, environmental studies/film and digital media) wore a floral paisley get-up she found at a costume shop downtown and completed the effect with tall white go-go boots.</p>
<p>Before getting this assembly together, she consulted her mother, who witnessed the 1960s first hand. Her mom instructed her to use "cat's eye eyeliner."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz history professor Greg O'Malley did his research too. He rocked an Andy Warhol wig, and made sure to hike his plaid trousers way up like the Rolling Stones did in 1965.</p>
<p>For Kelly Graber (College Eight '17, sociology with a minor in education), dressing up with a fuchsia dress and headband took her straight back to a "more free-spirited" time, "but in some ways it was also more formal. Guys wore skinny ties. Girls wore dresses. You don't really see that so much anymore."</p>
<p>The result was an immediate flashback to the days long before she was born when UC Santa Cruz was a landscape of fields, trailers for temporary housing, and lots of cows mooing in the background. And while most revelers had to search vintage clothing stores for inspiration, pioneer staff member Jerry Walters, the campus's inaugural director of housing, just brought out a few items he'd been saving in his closet for years, including a jaunty cap, plaid jacket, and skinny tie.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal showed up wearing a fedora he found at the Closet Capers costume shop in Santa Cruz, while campus provost/executive vice chancellor Alison Galloway got some compliments for the pillbox hat she made herself.</p>
<p>The party would not have been the same without the loud, rocking songs from those times.</p>
<p>Cassandra Cronin (Crown '15, anthropology and art), KZSC's station manager, did intensive research when building up the playlist for the celebration. "I tried to get into the nuggets," she said, referring to "deep cuts" or "B-sides" on long-playing records and singles. She also perused set lists from concerts in 1965.</p>
<p>"We're playing the Rolling stones, the Kings, the Seeds; anything with the word 'the' in front of it is usually what I'm going to play," noted Brandon Olesky (Crown '15, computer science), a KZSC DJ and the campus station's new media director. In those days, bands were aiming to get a fuzzier tone by using high wattage or low-quality amps, he said. "They didn't want a clean guitar sound. They wanted a dirty guitar."</p>
<p>At several points during the festivities, a group of young protesters banged drums and marched through the celebration. Sometimes their chanting and pounding fell in sync with the beat of the British Invasion bands.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the student protest was the UC Regents vote in late 2014 to approve a tuition hike of as much as 5 percent in each of the next five years to help cover rising costs and to expand the enrollment of California students. The decision triggered system-wide protests as well as state Senate and Assembly proposals to avoid steep tuition hikes.</p>
<p>The day's best costumes will be chosen by alumna and <i>Mad Men</i> Co-Costume Designer Tiffany White Stanton (Kresge '03, psychology).</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz's <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/">50th anniversary festivities</a>, which will continue throughout 2015, will celebrate the achievements of the first 50 years, while also illuminating the future of UC Santa Cruz. The events, on and off campus, offer opportunities for engagement with alumni, the campus community, local residents, and students.</p>

The study, published January 19 in <i>Nature</i>, provides a new understanding of the melanocortin pathway and could lead to new treatments for obesity.</p>
<p>Coauthor Glenn Millhauser, a distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, said the findings are very exciting and have broad biomedical implications. "We are getting to the real molecular features of what's controlling this important signaling system in the brain," Millhauser said.</p>
<p>The study, led by researchers at Vanderbilt University, focused on a receptor embedded in the membranes of nerve cells called the melanocortin-4 receptor, or MC4R. It belongs to a class of receptors known as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which typically act like on-off switches, signaling over short time frames, according to Roger Cone, who led the study at Vanderbilt.</p>
<p>"This finding identifies a molecular mechanism for converting an on-off switch into a rheostat," Cone said. "This could help explain slow, sustained biological processes that also are mediated by GPCRs, such as tanning or weight regain after dieting."</p>
<p>Millhauser's lab has done extensive research on proteins that bind to the MC4R receptor, such as agouti-related protein (AgRP). AgRP is a potent appetite stimulant. Its role in regulating energy balance is to suppress metabolism and increase feeding when the body needs to put on weight and store energy, Millhauser said. His lab has developed modified versions of the AgRP protein that alter its activity. In the new study, the modified proteins from Millhauser's lab helped researchers identify a previously unsuspected effect of AgRP.</p>
<p>Millhauser's previous studies have shown that a single dose of AgRP given to laboratory animals can stimulate daily food intake for up to 10 days. This observation didn't fit with the traditional "on-off" signaling model for the receptor it binds to, MC4R. G-protein coupled receptors can only take so much stimulation before they shut down, and this phenomenon, called desensitization, often happens rapidly.&#160;</p>
<p>Cone's lab discovered a companion protein--a potassium channel in the membrane called Kir7.1--that couples to the MC4R receptor and acts independently from G-protein signaling. The researchers found that AgRP induces MC4R to open the potassium channel, which "hyperpolarizes" and inhibits neurons that are involved in blocking appetite.</p>
<p>"Moreover, with modifications to AgRP discovered previously by our lab, we can increase or decrease this coupling of the receptor to the potassium channel," Millhauser said. "These concepts could ultimately lead to new generations of therapeutics for treating metabolic disorders, including obesity, anorexia, and cachexia, the wasting condition that often occurs in cancer treatment."</p>
<p>Coauthor Rafael Palomino, a graduate student and NIH Fellow in Millhauser's lab, did the protein synthesis and purification work for the study. The first author is Masoud Ghamari-Langroudi at Vanderbilt. Other contributors include Jerod Denton and Robert Matthews at Vanderbilt and Helen Cox at King's College, London. This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="03863a878072704673793532acde2c7b"><name>ladusaw-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens</title><summary>By Bill Ladusaw, Dean of Humanities — September 1965 was a good month for birthdays.

As UC Santa Cruz opened its doors with high aspirations, on the other side of the country Congress gave birth to twins that reinforced those ideals: the National Endowments for the Humanities and the Arts. <br/><br/>In the founding legislation, Congress declared that an advanced civilization must give full value and support to all branches of scholarly and cultural activity "in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future. <em>Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens.</em> It must therefore foster and support a form of education, and access to the arts and the humanities, designed to make people of all backgrounds and wherever located masters of their technology and not its unthinking servants." (P.L. 89-209, as amended)<br/><br/>Current events, from Ferguson to Paris, challenge us to reach for wisdom and vision: to move beyond reaction to thoughtful reflection, to wrestle information overload into informed understanding, and to reach for both sympathy for multiple perspectives and reasoned, critical response. NEH Chair (and UC Santa Cruz alumnus) William "Bro" Adams recently said in a <em>PBS NewsHour</em> interview, "The big challenges we face as a country revolve, again, around our history, our culture, our ideas and values."<br/><br/>The humanities seek an inclusive understanding and thoughtful construction of the human experience. The scholarly work of the university, its teaching and research, is appropriately "academic" in being free-ranging in its inquiry and disciplined in it standards of evaluation. Our mission of public service calls on us to share the value of this work with broader publics: to inform, to provoke reflection, and in the best-case scenario, to contribute to the development of wisdom and vision among citizens.<br/><br/>The calendar of upcoming 50th Anniversary events includes several humanities-related public events. On Tuesday evening, January 27, the Institute for Humanities Research will inaugurate a series of community conversations about Questions that Matter with "Making the Cosmos Local," at Kuumbwa Jazz Center. The following evening, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Convocation will feature Angela Davis, professor emerita of history of consciousness and feminist studies. And on February 26, Anita Hill will visit campus to give a public talk on sexual harassment law and gender and race equality. &#160;<br/><br/>I encourage you to attend one of these opportunities to engage with fellow citizens in the search for wisdom and vision. Humanities events are not just for humanities majors. <em>Nous sommes tous humains.</em><br/><br/><br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="03a2483b80727046737935321e481db6"><name>hellman-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2015 UC Santa Cruz Hellman Fellows Program open for proposals from assistant professors</title><summary>I am pleased to announce the annual call for applications for the UC Santa Cruz Hellman Fellows Program. </summary><start-date>1421694000000</start-date><display-name>Hellman Program</display-name><path>/2015/01/hellman-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/01/hellman-program</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1421695141870</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1421695216956</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am pleased to announce the annual call for applications for the UC Santa Cruz Hellman Fellows Program.

An update on the task force&#8217;s progress was presented Jan. 21 for discussion at the UC Board of Regents meeting at UCSF.<br/><br/>&#8220;The taskforce acted with swift, deliberate purpose in meeting the timeline the members were given,&#8221; UC President Janet Napolitano told the board. &#8220;I am pleased to report that they will meet all four of the milestones they were charged with reaching by January. These are important steps in ensuring that UC policy on preventing and responding to sexual assault and sexual violence is consistent across the entire University of California.&#8221;<br/><br/>Over the past four months, UC has successfully implemented task force recommendations aimed at improving services and response to sexual violence and ensuring consistency across the system. These include:<br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing a CARE: Advocate Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Sexual Misconduct&#8221; at every campus. The offices will have a full-time trained staff member on campus to provide crisis intervention to survivors and help them access other campus resources such as psychological counseling, emergency housing and academic accommodations. The advocates will help survivors understand their reporting options and accompany them through the reporting process, if they choose to file a report. These are independent offices, separate from reporting and investigations.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Implementing a standardized two-team response model at all UC campuses for addressing sexual violence: A case management team will review all current sexual misconduct reports to ensure that institutional responses are timely and appropriate and that those who file complaints and those who respond to allegations receive fair, objective and equal consideration. A second team will focus on policies, community relations, prevention and intervention using a campus collaborative approach.<br/>&#160;</li>
<li>Launching a new systemwide <a href="http://sexualviolence.universityofcalifornia.edu/">website</a> designed to serve as a user-friendly, one-stop portal for quick access to campus resources and important information. In addition, key information, such as how to get help, helping someone and reporting options, is being standardized across all primary campus sexual violence websites.</li>
</ul>
<br/>The university is also working diligently on the other task force recommendations slated to launch in July. These include developing a comprehensive education and training program on each campus and establishing unified investigation and adjudication standards and sanctions.<br/><br/>Before President Napolitano formed the task force in June 2014, all 10 UC campuses had systems and programs in place to educate, prevent and respond to sexual violence, but practices varied from one campus to another. The task force&#8217;s seven recommendations aim to strengthen existing services and programs and ensure the university has a consistent approach to addressing sexual violence on campuses.<br/><br/>President Napolitano also requested the task force address an additional issue: providing appropriate services to those responding to allegations. This eighth recommendation will be implemented systemwide in July.<br/><br/>Last year, the university significantly broadened and clarified its <a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000385/SHSV">policy against sexual violence and harassment</a>, including domestic violence, stalking and date rape. UC adopted an affirmative consent standard that defines consent as unambiguous, voluntary, informed and revocable. <br/><br/>The task force, led by Senior Vice President and Chief Compliance and Audit Officer Sheryl Vacca, includes UC regents, survivors of sexual assault and their advocates, students, faculty, police and other administrative staff. <br/><br/>For more information on the task force, click <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/ethics-compliance-audit-services/compliance/SVSA.html">here</a>.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://safe.ucsc.edu</url><title>safe.ucsc.edu</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://sexualviolence.universityofcalifornia.edu/</url><title>UC sexual violence website</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0e79b82b8072704673793532a39d416c"><name>wissard-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scientists drill through half mile of Antarctic ice for data on ice sheet stability </title><summary>A team including researchers from UC Santa Cruz has become the first ever to reach and sample the "grounding zone" of an Antarctic ice sheet.</summary><keywords>Slawek Tulaczyk, WISSARD, West Antarctic ice sheet</keywords><start-date>1421827200000</start-date><display-name>Scientists drill through half mile of Antarctic ice for data on ice sheet stability </display-name><path>/2015/01/wissard-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/01/wissard-update</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1421877032944</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1422401027523</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/neuhaus-branecky-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/neuhaus-branecky-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>neuhaus-branecky-400.jpg</name><display-name>neuhaus-branecky-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>101130</file-size><width>400</width><height>332</height></image><image-alt>students working with equipment</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/gravity-core-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/gravity-core-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gravity-core-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>gravity-core-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27456</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>researcher guiding core device</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>UC Santa Cruz graduate students Sarah Neuhaus and Carolyn Branecky prepared equipment to collect subglacial samples from the bore hole at the WISSARD Deep Field Site.

Data gathered from samples of sediment taken in the grounding zone will provide clues about the mechanics of ice sheets and their potential effects on sea-level rise.</p>
<p>Cameras sent down the drilling hole also revealed an unsuspected population of fish and invertebrates living beneath the ice sheet, the farthest south that fish have ever been found. The surprising discovery of fish in waters that are extremely cold (-2 degrees Celsius, 28 degrees Fahrenheit) and perpetually dark poses new questions about the ability of life to thrive in extreme environments.</p>
<p>"It is fascinating to see so much marine vertebrate and invertebrate life so far away from the open ocean and right where the West Antarctic Ice Sheet goes afloat," said Slawek Tulaczyk, a chief scientist with the Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling (WISSARD) project and a professor of Earth sciences at UC Santa Cruz. "I have spent my scientific career studying how this ice sheet may contribute to future global sea level rise. However, I now realize that retreat of the ice sheet may also impact a unique ecosystem."</p>
<p>The newest discoveries stem from the WISSARD project's investigation of the grounding zone of Whillans Ice Stream of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), roughly 850 kilometers (530 miles) from the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica's Ross Sea. Using a powerful hot-water drill developed and built by the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, researchers punched through nearly 740 meters (nearly 2,500 feet) of the Ross Ice Shelf on January 8.</p>
<p>On January 16, as more than 40 scientists, technicians, and camp staff were working around-the-clock to collect as many samples and data as they could while the borehole remained open, the WISSARD team deployed a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) called "Deep SCINI" -- (Submersible Capable of under Ice Navigation and Imaging, also developed at UNL) -- to explore about 400 square meters (4,300 square feet) of the marine cavity around the borehole.</p>
<p><strong>Fish and invertebrates</strong></p>
<p>The ROV discovered a variety of fish and invertebrates including numerous amphipods, or marine crustaceans, components of an ecosystem that may provide new insights into how creatures survive and even thrive in one of the world's most extreme environments.</p>
<p>"Finding fish, or any other type of life, under an ice shelf is by itself not novel," said John Priscu of Montana State University, a WISSARD chief scientist who has studied life in and under Antarctic ice for more than 30 years. "However, our WISSARD data will establish for the first time sources of carbon and energy for higher trophic levels in this most southerly marine ecosystem. Our data will also provide important information on the connectivity between subglacial environments and ice-shelf productivity, allowing us to predict first responders to a warming climate."</p>
<p>The grounding zone is extremely important for the stability of the ice sheet and ice shelf. The Texas-sized Ross Ice Shelf is the world's largest floating slab of ice. Numerous streams of ice in the West Antarctic ice sheet feed into the ice shelf, like rivers flowing into a lake.</p>
<p>Scientists are particularly interested in the dynamics between the ice, glacial sediments, and water in order to understand how the system may respond to future changes in climate. Some climate models predict warmer seawater may intrude into grounding zones and cause melting at the base of the ice shelf. A weakening or collapse of the Ross Ice Shelf would allow the ice streams of the WAIS to flow more rapidly into the ocean, which would raise global sea level.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Sediment cores</strong></p>
<p>While going down the borehole, cameras observed rich sedimentary debris in the ice. These observations, combined with data from cores of sediment collected from the sea floor and water from the marine cavity, will add significant information to the scientific questions about how the ice sheet works and interacts with sediment and ocean waters in these settings. They can perhaps provide answers to the recent past and possible future behavior of the massive West Antarctic Ice sheet.</p>
<p>"This season we accessed another critical polar environment which has never been directly sampled by scientists before: the grounding zone of the Antarctic ice sheet," noted Tulaczyk. "Nobody has ever actually done direct measurements in an environment like this."</p>
<p>After the initial Deep SCINI deployment, a package of oceanographic instruments developed at Northern Illinois University, including a downward-looking camera, recorded data in the cavity over a tidal cycle and also observed many fish swimming by.</p>
<p>Although life has been found previously under the Ross Ice Shelf, this site is the closest to the South Pole where such marine life has been documented. The southernmost ocean waters in the world are only 70 kilometers (43 miles) further south, under the Ross Ice Shelf at about 85 degrees South latitude.</p>
<p>"I have been investigating these types of environments for much of my career, and although I knew it would be difficult, I had been wanting to access this system for years because of its scientific importance," said Ross Powell, a chief scientist on the WISSARD project and a researcher at Northern Illinois University. "Rewards such as this, where we are gaining an understanding of the ice sheet dynamics and its interaction with ocean and sediment, as well as establishing the structure of its ecosystem, is especially rewarding -- a big pay-off in delayed gratification."</p>
<p>This part of the Antarctic continent includes Subglacial Lake Whillans, a shallow body of water located about 800 meters (2,600 feet) below the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which periodically fills and drains upstream from this grounding zone. The WISSARD team investigated the lake two seasons ago.</p>
<p>Fresh water from the lake is thought to eventually reach the seawater cavity at the present study site through a subglacial waterworks that may be similar to a coastal wetlands ecosystem -- think an estuary and its surrounding salt marshes, but one that is covered by ice, and missing all the marsh grasses. The ice sheet also delivers sediment to the grounding zone, which may influence ice dynamics and provide nutrients to this ecosystem.</p>
<p>WISSARD is funded by the National Science Foundation's Division of Polar Programs, which also provided the logistical support needed to succeed in the challenging Antarctic conditions. The Division manages the U.S. Antarctic Program, which coordinates all U.S. Scientific research on the continent.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://ucscice.blogspot.com</url><title>UCSC Glaciology Blog</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.wissard.org</url><title>WISSARD project web site</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1283c0a0807270467379353227bb5969"><name>award-greenwharf</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus, city take home prestigious governor's award</title><summary>In 2011, the City and UCSC created the GreenWharf program to foster the development and incorporation of innovative technology into the structure and operations at the Santa Cruz Wharf.</summary><start-date>1421944200000</start-date><display-name>State award</display-name><path>/2015/01/award-greenwharf</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/01/award-greenwharf</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1421944799337</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1421945195291</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In recognition of a multiyear collaboration between the City of Santa Cruz and the University of California, Santa Cruz, the GreenWharf partnership has been recognized with the 2014 Governor's Environmental and Economic Leadership Award. Representatives from the City and campus accepted the award at a ceremony Wednesday at the California Environmental Protection Agency in Sacramento.</p>
<p>In 2011, the City and UCSC created the GreenWharf program to foster the development and incorporation of innovative technology into the structure and operations at the Santa Cruz Wharf. GreenWharf has gained momentum and now involves a number of nonprofits, Wharf businesses, private sector entities, students, and interested members of the public. These parties are collaborating on interrelated projects that minimize the environmental impact of Wharf operations while enhancing its appeal as a visitor destination.</p>
<p>"We are honored to receive this recognition," said Ross Clark, Climate Change Action Coordinator with the City of Santa Cruz. "Our community is committed to economic progress with resource conservation and environmental considerations always at the forefront."</p>
<p>During the Wharf's Centennial Year in 2014, GreenWharf completed several high-profile initiatives including installing energy and cost-saving infrastructure, launching and completing a Wharf Green Business Certification Challenge, and creating an ecotourism mobile phone app.</p>
<p>Professor Michael Isaacson, as director of the<a href="http://censeps.soe.ucsc.edu"> Center for Sustainable Energy and Power Systems</a> (CenSEPS), coordinated the research efforts and worked on grant proposals to fund renewable energy projects, including a wind turbine and small solar array on the Wharf Headquarters building.</p>
<p>"CenSEPS has been working with the city to develop renewable energy testbeds in order to study the feasibility of using renewable energy sources to power local communities," Isaacson said. "There are many projects focused on renewable energy sources that we are anticipating pursuing in cooperation with the city."</p>
<p>The GreenWharf partnership also supports the City's and UCSC's Monterey Bay Climate Action Compact pledge to reduce municipal greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent by 2020 from a 1990 baseline.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://greenwharf.soe.ucsc.edu</url><title>The

their works to <em><strong>50/50</strong></em>&#8212;a new art exhibition celebrating the 50th anniversary of the campus that opens on February 5.<br/><br/>The show will take place at both the R. Blitzer Gallery on the Westside of Santa Cruz, and on campus at the Porter College Faculty Gallery. It runs at both venues until February 28. <br/><br/>Featuring 10 artists from each decade of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 50-year history, the exhibition will spotlight local and visiting alumni artists from Santa Cruz to New York City.<br/><br/>One of those artists is Molly Cliff Hilts, from Portland, Oregon, who has a particularly close connection to the campus. The Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery at UC Santa Cruz is named after her great grandmother.<br/><br/>Hilts graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1981, with a B.A. in Fine Art from Porter College. Her art is part of an emerging form that melds painting, photography and printing, using wax, lithographic ink, oil and graphite.<br/><br/>&#8220;I entered UCSC my junior year, and I loved riding my bike up the hill with my heavy art history books in my backpack, amidst the golden rolling hills and big oak trees, with the backdrop of the Monterey Bay,&#8221; Hilts recalled. &#8220;I loved my classes: astronomy, Russian, art history, printmaking, sculpture, and especially photography with Norman Locks.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;I made friends for life at UCSC and stayed in Santa Cruz after college, for a few years, working for a couple of local architecture and design firms,&#8221; she added.<br/><br/>Hilts&#8217; artwork can now be found in notable collections worldwide, including the private collection of Bill and Melinda Gates. <br/><br/>Her landscape paintings are also the basis for a presentation that debuted in the U.S. at the Getty Center for <em>Paradoxical Undressing</em>, a live spoken-word, music and visual installation by musician Kristin Hersh. <br/><br/>For the past 14 years, Hilts and her husband have also been hosting salon gatherings of artists, writers and musicians. A surprising discovery at her parents&#8217; home of a bound 108-page book recently revealed that these salons are actually a continuation of a family history of hosting salons that was started by her great grandmother in 1911.<br/><br/>&#8220;I think back on her life and the contributions she made&#8211;she lived for community, art, and supporting others in their artistic endeavors,&#8221; Hilts observed. &#8220;It is a bit surreal to be organically continuing in this family tradition.&#8221;<br/><br/>Hilts said she was looking forward to returning to campus and seeing the other alumni artists on February 5 at the opening reception of the exhibition at the Porter College Faculty Gallery. <br/><br/>&#8220;It will be really interesting to be all together surrounded by our work,&#8221; she noted. &#8220;All of us were influenced by our professors, the environment, the era we attended, and that unique and sublime experience we shared on the grounds of Porter.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Who knows what collaborations could come out of this? I am honored to be included,&#8221; Hilts added. <br/><br/></p>

The report, released January 26 by the USGS, provides detailed calculations that will be useful for managers developing coastal resilience plans or ecosystem restoration efforts, and for engineers designing future infrastructure.</p>
<p>Information on changes in waves and winds under global climate change is crucial to understanding the sustainability of existing infrastructure and natural and cultural resources, as well as to planning for future investments such as renewable wind and wave energy for islands, or for understanding the viability of coastal-related economic activities such as fishing and tourism. Wave- and wind-driven processes drive flooding and inundation of coastal land, potentially resulting in damage to islands' infrastructure, fresh-water supplies, and natural resources, and harming federally protected species such as nesting seabirds. Such impacts may only be exacerbated in the future with projected trends in sea-level rise.</p>
<p>"With little to no publicly available historical wind and wave data for most of the U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands, and no future projections of waves and winds for different climate scenarios, there was a great science and management need to understand how waves and wind might change in future climates," said Curt Storlazzi, USGS oceanographer and lead author of the study.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz graduate students James Shope (Earth and planetary sciences) and Christie Hegermiller (ocean sciences) worked with Storlazzi and other USGS scientists on the report. The team ran four global climate models (developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), using them to drive a global wave model to look at the projected changes in wave heights, wave periods, and wave directions, as well as wind speed and wind direction, on three Hawaiian Islands and 22 other locations on U.S.-affiliated islands in the Pacific Ocean. The modeling results project that wind and wave patterns will change over the years throughout the century, and also over certain months and seasons within each year.</p>
<p>"Natural resource managers, communities, and engineers will all benefit by being able to prepare for the shifts in inundation risk shown by this study. This work shows that the degree of change we see will depend on how greenhouse-gas emissions change," said Jeff Burgett, science coordinator for the Pacific Islands Climate Change Cooperative.</p>
<p>The scientists first ran the models for the years 1976 to 2005 and compared them to the few available historical instrumental data in order to make sure the models were functioning properly. They then ran the models for two time spans in the future (2026 to 2045 and 2085 to 2100) under two different climatic scenarios: increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations until mid century followed by reduced emissions (known as scenario RCP4.5); and unfettered growth of emissions (scenario RCP8.5).</p>
<p>The spatial patterns and trends are mostly similar between the two different scenarios for greenhouse gas concentrations, although the results of the study reveal some differences among islands. The magnitude and spatial extent of the trends are generally greater for the higher-emissions scenario (RCP8.5).</p>
<p>In general, extreme wave heights (the top five percent) are projected to increase from now until mid-21st century and then decrease toward the end of the 21st century. Peak wave periods (another measure of intensity) increase east of the International Date Line and are forecast to decrease west of the International Date Line. In equatorial Micronesia, extreme waves and winds are projected to undergo substantial (greater than 20 degrees) shifts in direction.</p>

Our students acquire the knowhow to be both cultural producers and critical interpreters of the world around them.&#160; Many of our majors intervene in artistic, social, and political debates by creating films, operas, plays, musical compositions, dances, paintings, prints, and performance art.&#160; Others immerse themselves in understanding what such artistic creations reveal of the historical eras and cultures in which they were produced. <br/><br/>All of our students gain fluency in new visual and acoustic languages, which allows them to create and decipher a range of arts. Rather than passively consuming films, recitals, and exhibitions, our students learn to be thoughtful creators and decoders of the complex visual and aural texts that are a ubiquitous feature of twenty-first century culture.<br/><br/>Our majors also gain understanding of the varied cultural traditions of the nation and the world at a moment when our state and country are becoming increasingly diverse and interconnected. In the Arts at UC Santa Cruz, many of our students immerse themselves in the canonical art of Shakespearean theater, Renaissance painting, and Hollywood film, but they are just as likely to plunge into Indonesian dance, contemporary Latino art, African-American music, or global cinema. <br/><br/>Our graduates consistently remark on how their studies have provided them with the ability to understand cultures different from their own and find new ways of thinking about complex social problems. &#160;<br/><br/>So, whether they ultimately seek a career in the arts or beyond, our students graduate with the aptitudes and perspectives that are essential for employees, students, and citizens in our increasingly globalized society. <br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2d42065f80727046737935320db3d17d"><name>tony-hill-award-jacob-martinez</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tony Hill Award winner helps young people soar</title><summary>Jacob Martinez, this year's Tony Hill Award honoree, is a strong advocate for low-income Latino and Latina youth who are interested in science, math, and technological careers but face obstacles along the way.</summary><start-date>1422393600000</start-date><display-name>Tony Hill award honoree Jacob Martinez 2015</display-name><path>/2015/01/tony-hill-award-jacob-martinez</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/01/tony-hill-award-jacob-martinez</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1422393476647</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1422393845264</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Community Studies</value><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/Jacob Martinez350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/Jacob Martinez350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Jacob Martinez350.jpg</name><display-name>Jacob Martinez350.jpg</display-name><file-size>43341</file-size><width>255</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/JacobMartinez80thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/JacobMartinez80thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>JacobMartinez80thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>Jacob Martinez80thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>14575</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>photo by Carolyn Lagattuta</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>For the past decade, Jacob Martinez, UC Santa Cruz alumnus and founder of nonprofit Digital NEST, has developed programs guiding students of color toward college and beyond</article-subhead><article-text><p>Jacob Martinez, this year's Tony Hill Award honoree, is a strong advocate for low-income Latino and Latina youth who are interested in science, math, and technological careers but face obstacles along the way.<br/> <br/>Martinez (Oakes '04, ecology and evolutionary biology) will receive the award during the 31st annual Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation at 7 p.m., January 28, at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. The event, featuring keynote speaker Angela Davis, is free and open to the public.<br/> <br/>This special honor recognizes individuals whose lives and actions exemplify the late Tony Hill's work and legacy.<br/> <br/>Hill, a longtime advocate for social and economic justice in Santa Cruz County, was known for his skills as a community bridge-builder and mediator. He died in 2007 at age 62.<br/> <br/>Award recipients receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice.<br/> <br/>For the past decade, Martinez, 37, has developed and overseen programs guiding students of color toward college and beyond. He has worked hard to increase the confidence and skill levels in Latinos interested in information technology.<br/> <br/>Last year, Martinez further increased his impact by founding Digital NEST (Nurturing Entrepreneurial Skills with Technology), which creates sustainable and scalable technology centers in vulnerable communities all over California. The goal is to create economic equality for the residents of low-income and rural communities by breaking down the "Digital Divide," teaching them the technology skills needed to become competitive and self-sufficient in the digital future.<br/> <br/>When Martinez found out about receiving the award, he was "blown away," he said. "It was very humbling to be mentioned along with someone like Tony Hill."<br/> <br/>Melanie Stern, Tony Hill's widow and a member of the award selection committee, praised Martinez's sincerity, hard work, and commitment.<br/> <br/>"I visited Jacob and got a great sense of Digital NEST," Stern said. "I thought it was extraordinary. It's a great space. He is addressing an unmet community need in Watsonville. His work is very grassroots, which is right in line with Tony's beliefs about working within the community. He's also partnered with so many different groups, which was another strong value for Tony."<br/> <br/>Martinez takes great pride in steering young Latinos and Latinas toward careers in science and technology. This desire dates back to his undergraduate years at UC Santa Cruz when he was studying the sciences "and often found myself one of the few people of color in my science classes," he said. Around the same time, he became immersed in community studies courses, which helped fine-tune his philosophies about impactful, socially conscious work. Upon graduation he wanted to find a way to stay involved in the sciences while working with youth in underserved communities.<br/> <br/>"The youth I have been working with for the past 10 years have the same aspirations, the same interests, as youth in any community," Martinez observed. "They like tech, they like sciences, and they want to help out their community, but there are these barriers they confront on a daily basis.<br/> <br/>"Their parents are often working in the fields, trying to make ends meet, or working manufacturing jobs," Martinez continued. "They don't have professional adults and parents guiding them on the path to college and careers."<br/> <br/>Many lack role models and don't have access to the necessary tools including good working computers at home or web access, he said.<br/> <br/>"They need a place to build careers and get more technical information. For me, it's a social justice issue. There is an industry with tons of available jobs, but here is this demographic of people who don't have the means to pursue them. It's almost like a form of segregation. They need role models. They need access. They need work space."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2d43147c8072704673793532f156730b"><name>sea-slugs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Roses bloom in tide pools: warm water brings southern sea slug to Central Coast</title><summary>Bright pink, inch-long sea slugs have shown up in the highest numbers and northernmost locations reported since the 1998 El Niño</summary><keywords>John Pearse, Jeff Goddard, nudibranch, Hopkins' rose nudibranch, Pacific Decadal Oscillation</keywords><start-date>1422547200000</start-date><display-name>Roses bloom in tide pools: warm water brings southern sea slug to Central Coast</display-name><path>/2015/01/sea-slugs</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/01/sea-slugs</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1422393545811</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1422569240972</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/okenia-rosacea-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/okenia-rosacea-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>okenia-rosacea-400.jpg</name><display-name>okenia-rosacea-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>77015</file-size><width>400</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt>pink sea slug</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/okenia-rosacea-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/okenia-rosacea-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>okenia-rosacea-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>okenia-rosacea-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21811</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>pink sea slug</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Hopkins' rose nudibranch <i>(Okenia rosacea)</i> is a mostly southern species of sea slug that has appeared this year in large numbers on the central and northern California coast.

<p>The Hopkins' rose nudibranch <i>(Okenia rosacea)</i> is locally common in southern California but sporadic in central California and rare north of San Francisco. In the past few weeks, however, researchers from UC Santa Cruz, UC Santa Barbara, Bodega Marine Laboratory, and the California Academy of Sciences have reported densities of up to dozens per square meter in tide pools from San Luis Obispo to Humboldt Counties. These are the highest numbers and northernmost records of this species seen since the strong El Ni&#241;os of 1998 and 1983.</p>
<p>"We haven't seen anything like it in years. These nudibranchs are mainly southern species, and they have been all but absent for more than a decade," said John Pearse, professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys</strong></p>
<p>Pearse and other researchers have been conducting surveys of nudibranchs at study sites along the California coast for decades. "What makes this event especially exciting for us is that in 2011 we published a paper in which we predicted that oceanographic conditions like we are now experiencing would be marked by heavy recruitment of these and other nudibranchs. It's just wonderful to see the prediction coming true," Pearse said.</p>
<p>The research team includes his wife Vicki Pearse, a research associate at UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS); Jeff Goddard, a project scientist at UCSB's Marine Science Institute; Terrence Gosliner, senior curator at the California Academy of Sciences; and IMS researcher Gary McDonald. Steward Shultz, the first author of the <a href="http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_56/issue_2/0749.html">2011 paper in <i>Limnology and Oceanography</i></a>, is at the University of Zadar, Croatia.</p>
<p>Pearse noted that the study relied in part on data from Goddard's senior thesis research in the mid-1970s, when he worked with Pearse as a UCSC undergraduate. "It is always pleasing to me to see our students' senior theses end up in publications," Pearse said.</p>
<p><strong>Pacific Decadal Oscillation</strong></p>
<p>Unlike the last time <i>Okenia rosacea</i> bloomed on the central coast, there has been no El Ni&#241;o to speak of this year. According to Goddard, the current population bloom is similar to the one he observed on the central coast starting in early 1977. That bloom was also during a weak El Ni&#241;o, but it happened to coincide with a major climate shift in the eastern Pacific Ocean known as the <a href="http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/">Pacific Decadal Oscillation</a>. That shift marked the beginning of more than two decades of coastal water temperatures that were elevated compared to the preceding 30 years, triggering range shifts in numerous coastal species, including gastropods, barnacles, fish, and dolphins.</p>
<p>During those warm decades, fluctuations in the abundance of intertidal adults of <i>Okenia rosacea</i> and other nudibranchs in central California were driven by regional oceanographic influences on currents and larval recruitment. In the 2011 paper, the researchers predicted high recruitment of these nudibranchs during periods of warm temperatures, northward-directed currents, and weak upwelling, and that is just what is happening now, Goddard said.</p>
<p>Like the previous population explosions of <i>Okenia rosacea</i><b>,</b> the current bloom has also been accompanied by other sea slugs normally found farther south, including the bright purple and orange Spanish shawl <i>(Flabellina iodinea)</i> and the California sea hare <i>(Aplysia californica).</i> While southern species of fish, seabirds, and marine mammals have also appeared in northern California as adults, nudibranchs differ in being carried as microscopic planktonic larvae on the coastal currents northward and onshore. When the larvae have fed and grown large enough (typically over a month or two), they settle to the bottom and, if they encounter the prey of the adults, they metamorphose into juvenile slugs.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Pink pigmentation</strong></p>
<p>The prey for Hopkins' rose nudibranch is a rose-colored encrusting bryozoan on which it feeds during its entire benthic life and from which it derives its pink pigmentation. This perennial bryozoan is locally abundant on the Pacific coast up into British Columbia. The nudibranch's distribution, therefore, is not limited by the availability of its prey but likely by a combination of cold temperatures and ocean circulation patterns.</p>
<p>Because they are fast-growing, live for a year or less, and move little as adults, these nudibranchs are potentially useful in tracking relatively rapid changes in ocean conditions. The current population bloom has the researchers wondering if the nudibranchs are signaling, as a sort of zoological semaphore, another major climate shift from cold to warm coastal waters.</p>
<p>"Although the index values of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation have really jumped the past few months, it's probably still too early to say, at least until we become better at decoding the signals," Goddard said. "However, if a decadal shift is in progress, there's a good chance the next El Ni&#241;o will be a major event, on par with the 1983 and 1998 events, and bring with it myriad surprises from the south."</p>
<p>Good locations to view the current bloom of <i>Okenia rosacea</i> in central California include rocky shore tidepools and underneath ledges at Monta&#241;a de Oro and Asilomar State Parks, Scott Creek Beach, Pigeon Point, Pillar Point, and Fitzgerald Marine Reserve. Goddard advises checking local tide charts and going during a minus tide, preferably when both the swell and wind are low, and to tread lightly, wearing shoes or boots you don't mind getting wet.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="32c42e178072704673793532d2fade8d"><name>romero-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Game designer Brenda Romero honored with Game Developers Choice Award</title><summary>Romero, director of the UC Santa Cruz Games and Playable Media master's program, will receive the GDCA Ambassador Award</summary><keywords>Brenda Romero, GDC, GDCA, Game Developers Conference, Game Developers Choice Awards</keywords><start-date>1422432000000</start-date><display-name>Game designer Brenda Romero honored with Game Developers Choice Award</display-name><path>/2015/01/romero-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/01/romero-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1422485892544</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1425081391094</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/brenda-romero-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/brenda-romero-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brenda-romero-350.jpg</name><display-name>brenda-romero-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>89642</file-size><width>350</width><height>424</height></image><image-alt>Brenda Romero</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/brenda-romero-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/brenda-romero-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brenda-romero-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>brenda-romero-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>29878</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Brenda Romero</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Brenda Romero (Photo by C.

Officers conducted an enforcement stop on Patrick Sizemore, a 44-year-old transient, and Emily Kathleen Barnett, a 28-year-old Ben Lomond resident as they attempted to drive away.</p>
<p>Officers suspected Sizemore and Barnett were responsible for recent auto burglaries on campus, and identified Sizemore as the person of interest in the January 13 crime bulletin. Some items from the recent auto burglaries were recovered, and it is believed that some other items located in their vehicle may have been stolen during recent burglaries in Aptos.</p>
<p>Sizemore was arrested on a suspicion of burglary; conspiracy to commit burglary; possession of burglary tools; possession of stolen property; unlawful possession of a prohibited knife; and possession of marijuana, and was booked into the Santa Cruz County Jail.</p>
<p>Police are looking for Barnett, who was inadvertently released from a hospital after using a stolen drivers license.&#160;</p>
<p>The investigation into these auto burglaries continues. Anyone who may be a witness to these burglaries or has information regarding these crimes is encouraged to call the UC Santa Cruz Police Department at 831-459-2231, ext. 1.</p>

<p>The last time a convocation drew a comparable response was in 2002 when Alice Walker, author of the bestselling 1982 novel <i>The Color Purple</i> delivered the keynote.</p>
<p>Davis described her speech as a way of reflecting on Martin Luther King's place in history and carrying his ideas into the present day. She referred in particular to King's "beyond Vietnam" speech delivered a year before his assassination, and quoted at length from his famous address: "I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we &#8230; must rapidly begin the shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights, are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered."</p>
<p>During her &#160;50-minute talk, Davis tied "police militarization" in America to the shootings of unarmed black citizens&#8212;and she provided a long, grim list of recent examples to back up her point. In her lecture, "Racism, Militarism, and Poverty: From Ferguson to Palestine," she drew comparisons between police militarization and brutality in the United States and Israel's military presence in the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>"Palestinian activists were identifying with our struggles with racist violence" after the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager shot by a white police officer last summer in Ferguson, Missouri, she said. "It was Palestinian activists who noticed not only the militarization of the Ferguson police but the similarities of some of the weapons used in Ferguson with some of the weapons used in occupied Palestine," she remarked.</p>
<p>Davis said she witnessed impassioned responses to the killing during her recent travels overseas, "especially after young people began to mobilize and let it be known that that they would not sit quietly by while young people were struck down by the police. In Brussels, Belgium, people wanted to hear about the struggles against racist police violence, and even though they didn't speak English, they were saying, 'Hands up, don't shoot.'"</p>
<p>Reiterating King's grave concerns about the "triumvirate of racism, militarism, and poverty," Davis called for broad systemic changes. "If we want an end to anti-black and anti-Latino racism we will also have to speak out against economic exploitation, against war, against the destruction of the environment, against anti-Muslimism and anti-Semitism, against gender bias and homophobia, and of course for access to good organic non-GMO food, for free health care and free education for all.'"</p>
<p>By the end of the evening she'd also called for the total disarmament of everyone in America including the police.</p>
<p>While many people inside the auditorium were highly enthusiastic and cheered many of her main talking points, the event also drew controversy; 22 Jewish UC Santa Cruz alumni expressed their anger about the selection of Angela Davis as the convocation speaker and called her topic choice inflammatory in an open letter. UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal responded to concerns earlier in the week with a <a href="http://chancellor.ucsc.edu/blog/2015/speech.html">statement </a>about the importance of constructive debate and the free exchange of ideas.&#160;</p>
<p>Davis was the latest in a long list of high-profile speakers who has addressed the crowd at the convention. Others include Yolanda King, activist, actress, and daughter of Martin Luther King Jr.; the actress and activist Cicely Tyson; Harvard University professor Cornel West; author and social activist bell hooks; and poet, commentator, activist, and professor Nikki Giovanni.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz Mayor Don Lane was on hand to give Angela Davis "the key to the city'' of Santa Cruz. He told Davis that his daughter was a great fan of hers.</p>
<p>The evening was also a chance to honor Jacob Martinez, this year's honoree of the Tony Hill Memorial Award, given to a Santa Cruz&#8211;area community member who embodies the bridge building, mediation, and community activism of Tony Hill, who died of a heart attack in 2007.</p>
<p>Martinez (Oakes '04, ecology and evolutionary biology) is a strong advocate for low-income Latino and Latina youth who are interested in science, math, and technological careers but face obstacles along the way. He is the second UC Santa Cruz alumnus to receive this high honor; the first was Deutron Kebebew (Kresge '03, electrical engineering), former foster child and a hardworking advocate for teens and children.</p>

The awards will provide a total of $12,515 in research funding for the student projects, which were selected by a proposal review committee.</p>
<p>Committee chair Bob Simpkins said, "What we ultimately awarded was travel up and down the states of California and Oregon, visits to the Channel Islands, the Sea of Cortez, the Arctic Ocean, the Caribbean, and Spain to study crabs, krill, otters, layers of rock, sea lions, dolphins, birds, fish, abalone and sea levels. We funded the purchase of cameras, foul weather gear, spotting scopes, sea lion whiskers, feathers, pipettes, French square bottles, and dolphin gut bacteria. It's amazing what $12,500 can buy!"</p>
<p>The award recipients were recognized at a ceremony and reception at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center on Thursday, January 29. In addition, the Friends of Long Marine Lab will honor the top two student research award recipients -- Juliano Calil, a graduate student in ocean sciences, and undergraduate Emily Slesinger -- with a special award to be presented at the annual Global Oceans Awards Gala in March at the University Center.</p>
<p>The Friends of LML provides funding for public education, marine mammal programs, and student research, as well as the development and operation of the Seymour Center. The Student Research and Education Awards are made possible from annual income on six endowed funds: Jane McHenry Student Award, Lillian McPherson Rouse Award, Friends of Long Marine Lab Student Support, Mark T. MacMillan Memorial Prize, Ken Norris Marine Mammal Research Award, and William Beye Heald Scholarship Fund.</p>

Bill Monning issued a joint resolution lauding Fairlie for his involvement in projects on entrepreneurship and small business training, and providing access to technology for students in middle school through community college. A representative of Alejo&#8217;s office presented Fairlie with the resolution this week.</p>
<p>The resolution states that Fairlie &#8220;has served as a worthy model for all public-spirited people of the state&#8221; due to his&#160; &#8220;incredible commitment of time and energy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tuesday, (February 3) Fairlie is <a href="http://uccs.ucdavis.edu/events/2015-February-5-Farille">scheduled to speak at UC Center Sacramento</a> on two recent research projects that examine the relationship between community colleges and human capital.&#160; One study looks at whether providing improved access to computers could help low-income students on financial aid perform better. In the other, he examines whether underrepresented minority students perform better when taught by underrepresented minority instructors.</p>
<p>Fairlie has testified before the U.S. Senate on how the lack of access to capital affects minority business owners and the widening wealth gap that results. <br/><br/>In September 2013, Fairlie testified in Sacramento&#160; in favor of a bill by Alejo to raise the California minimum wage. The bill passed, raising the state minimum wage from $8 to $9 an hour last July. It will increase to $10 an hour in two years. <br/><br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/04/3693.html</url><title>Senate testimony </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/03/fairlie-testimony.html</url><title>Previous coverage</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/09/fairlie-ca-min-wage.html</url><title>Minimum wage testimony</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/01/images/fairlie_resolution-4501.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/01/images/fairlie_resolution-4501.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fairlie_resolution-4501.jpg</name><display-name>fairlie_resolution-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>22319</file-size><width>295</width><height>128</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title>ROB FAIRLIE</title><description>State Legislature commends the Economics Department chair for working to reduce poverty, improve education, and increase job opportunities and entrepreneurship. </description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4b516928807270466ce34d01b1433a2d"><name>local-robbery</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Armed robbery at 7-Eleven on Cardiff Place</title><summary>Police officers with the City of Santa Cruz and UC Santa Cruz responded at 3 a.m. January 30 to an armed robbery at the 7-Eleven on Cardiff Place. </summary><start-date>1422604800000</start-date><display-name>Armed robbery at 7-Eleven on Cardiff Place</display-name><path>/2015/01/local-robbery</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/01/local-robbery</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1422897801454</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1422897896082</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>Police officers with the City of Santa Cruz and UC Santa Cruz responded at 3 a.m. January 30 to an armed robbery at the 7-Eleven on Cardiff Place.
