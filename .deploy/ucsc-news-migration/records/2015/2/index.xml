<p>Researchers surveyed 67 locations with historical records of pikas and found that the animals have disappeared from ten of them (15 percent of the sites surveyed). Pika populations were most likely to go locally extinct at sites with high summer temperatures and low habitat area, said Joseph Stewart, a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz and first author of a paper reporting the new findings, published January 29 in the <i><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.12466/abstract">Journal of Biogeography</a></i>.</p>
<p>"This same pattern of extinctions at sites with high summer temperatures has also been observed in the Great Basin region," Stewart said.</p>
<p>Pikas are small herbivores related to rabbits that live in fields of broken rock (called talus) in the mountains of western North America. With high metabolic rates and thick fur (including inside their ears and on the bottoms of their feet), they are well adapted to the cold temperatures at high elevations. Since they do not hibernate during winter, they spend the summer gathering grasses and wildflowers to store in "haypiles" for winter subsistence.</p>
<p>"Backpackers and hikers often see pikas scurrying back and forth across the rocks, gathering little bouquets of wildflowers in their mouths," Stewart said. "They are uniquely adapted to cold temperatures, but these same adaptations make the species vulnerable to global warming."</p>
<p><strong>Forced underground</strong></p>
<p>When summer temperatures are too high, pikas are forced to stay underground to avoid overheating. Less time spent foraging means they don't have as much food to eat, which increases the likelihood of local extinction.</p>
<p>The researchers used their data on where pikas have disappeared to develop a predictive model they could use to explore the fate of the species in the face of ongoing global warming. By 2070, the model predicts that pikas will have disappeared from much of their historical range in California (39 to 88 percent of sites). The severity of the decline will depend on how much summer temperatures actually rise. The researchers looked at a total of 34 different global climate model outputs, encompassing different degrees of atmospheric sensitivity to greenhouse gases and different levels of human emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>If only modest action is taken to reign in greenhouse gas emissions, the model predicts that pikas will disappear from about 75 percent of sites by 2070 (51 to 88 percent, depending on the global climate model used). With aggressive action to reduce greenhouse gases, the model predicts that only about 51 percent of sites will suffer local extinction (39 to 79 percent, depending on the global climate model).</p>
<p>"It looks like we're going to lose pikas from many areas where people have been used to seeing them. It's a loss not just for the pikas but also for future generations who won't get to have that experience," Stewart said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Ecological roles</strong></p>
<p>Pikas also play important ecological roles, he said. They are prey to many species, such as owls and stoats, and they alter vegetation and soil composition through their foraging activities. Furthermore, he said, the shrinking range of pikas is just one example of the negative effects of global warming on plant and animal species around the world. Other high-elevation species, such as Belding's ground squirrel and whitebark pine, are also vulnerable and could lose a much larger proportion of their range. Stewart is currently working with UC Santa Cruz biologist Barry Sinervo to study the effects of climate change on the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, which also faces major losses of suitable habitat. Sinervo led a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/05/3787.html">landmark study published in 2010</a> documenting the widespread extinction of lizard populations around the world due to climate change.</p>
<p>"Pikas are a model organism for studying climate change, and their decline at low-elevation sites suggests that the future for other species is not great either," Stewart said. "The problem is that the climate is changing faster than species can adapt or disperse to new sites."</p>
<p>Pikas and other high-elevation species can respond to warming temperatures by moving upslope to higher elevations. But in many locations the mountains just aren't high enough to provide a refuge from warming temperatures for high-elevation species. The study predicts that only the highest peaks of the southern Sierra Nevada, Mt. Shasta, and the White Mountains are likely to remain suitable for pikas through the end of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Stewart worked on this study as a research assistant for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife under the supervision of Fish and Wildlife scientist David Wright. Other coauthors of the paper include John Perrine and Cody Massing at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo; Lyle Nichols at Santa Monica College; James Thorne at UC Davis; Constance Millar of the U.S. Forest Service; and Kenneth Goehring at College of the Siskiyous. Partial funding for surveys was provided by a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service grant to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/jbi.12466/asset/supinfo/jbi12466-sup-0002-AppendixS3.gif?v=1&amp;s=b291f07fd76ba5edf2e2bf33c0c0c051eb021e09</url><title>Animation of projected fate of pikas at 67 sites in California</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.12466/abstract</url><title>Article in Journal of Biogeography</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4cb8fd39807270466ce34d010718305f"><name>galloway-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Our vision, our goals, our future</title><summary>By Alison Galloway, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor — I am pleased to announce the finalized Strategic Plan is now available at envision.ucsc.edu.

It represents the efforts of faculty, staff, students, and community members to define our strengths and identify a shared vision for our future. I believe these goals are critical to the attainment of this vision. Through this plan we will commit to focusing our efforts on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/academic-planning/index.html">Allocating faculty resources strategically</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/research/index.html">Supporting research excellence</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/student-success/index.html">Advancing student success</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/staff-engagement/index.html">Making UC Santa Cruz a place where people enjoy working</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/reputation/index.html">Telling the world our story</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/operations/index.html">Addressing workload burden</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While developing the vision and these goals has been important, the bigger question is, <em>will we actually implement change based on these choices?</em> I am pleased to state that implementation of the plan has already begun. In the coming weeks, you will hear more about the action plans for each goal and the work done so far. In parallel, the website will be updated with details about project leads, timelines, and metrics of success. As the action plans are rolled out, you can return to the website to see specifics.<br/><br/>I encourage you to visit the <a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/">website</a> and, as you approach your work, consider how our individual and collective efforts contribute to the attainment of these goals.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="51e0bed98072701754d6488ae98e4150"><name>volunteer-profile-ruiz</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Volunteer profile: Jerry Ruiz</title><summary>It is a deep emotional connection I feel toward UC Santa Cruz that drives me to volunteer each year. </summary><keywords>Jerry Ruiz</keywords><start-date>1422950400000</start-date><display-name>Volunteer profile: Jerry Ruiz</display-name><path>/2015/02/volunteer-profile-ruiz</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/02/volunteer-profile-ruiz</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1423007858362</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1423872132519</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/ruiz-jerry.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/ruiz-jerry.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ruiz-jerry.jpg</name><display-name>ruiz-jerry.jpg</display-name><file-size>102985</file-size><width>300</width><height>412</height></image><image-alt>Alumni volunteer Jerry Ruiz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/ruiz-jerry thumb.png</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/ruiz-jerry thumb.png</link><site>news</site><name>ruiz-jerry thumb.png</name><display-name>ruiz-jerry thumb.png</display-name><file-size>20530</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alumni volunteer Jerry Ruiz</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>"I say, without hesitation, I owe much to UC Santa Cruz and will gladly give my time to help make it a better place for all concerned," says alumni volunteer Jerry Ruiz.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong><i>As part of UC Santa Cruz's 50th anniversary recogntion throughout 2015, we continue to proudly feature our alumni volunteers.

<h2>Why do you volunteer with UC Santa Cruz?</h2>
<p>It is a deep emotional connection I feel toward UC Santa Cruz that drives me to volunteer each year. I give my time in support of UC Santa Cruz because the social interactions I had with such a diverse community of thoughtful people and the challenging education I received built a solid foundation upon which I have been able to achieve so many blessings over the course of my life, from the lifelong friends I met there, to preparing me for law school at UC Berkeley, to becoming a practicing attorney for the past 35 years. I say, without hesitation, I owe much to UC Santa Cruz and will gladly give my time to help make it a better place for all concerned.</p>
<h2>Why types of things do you do as a Slug volunteer?</h2>
<p>For the past 10 years I have had both the pleasure and honor of serving on the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Council including two years in the leadership role as president. I also have participated many times as an alumni panelist on law and business at the annual Multicultural Career Conference on campus. I was asked to be the alumni speaker at the Rainbow Graduation several years ago. I have made telephone calls to out-of-state freshman admittees to encourage them to enroll at UC Santa Cruz. I have written postcards to alumni and friends to invite them to Alumni Weekend on campus. Locally, I have recruited for UC Santa Cruz at several Los Angeles&#8211;area high schools during college day fairs. I also serve now on the Southern California Board of Councilors for the UC Santa Cruz Division of Social Sciences. And, I continue to keep my profile on the Career Advice Network to be available for current and graduating students to contact me with questions about law or business.</p>
<h2>What has been the most rewarding thing about volunteering with your alma mater?</h2>
<p>Volunteering for UC Santa Cruz results in so many rewarding moments, but, for me, the thing I enjoy most is sharing an "aha" moment whenever I meet someone and we realize we're both Slug alums, like we're both immediately transported back and fondly remembering our time on campus. I never get tired answering the question, "So, how did you like Santa Cruz?"</p>
<h2>Words of advice for those thinking of volunteering with UC Santa Cruz?</h2>
<p>Like any volunteer opportunity, take on what you're passionate about, be it mentoring current UC Santa Cruz students, hosting social gatherings with your fellow UC Santa Cruz alumni and friends, representing the campus at high school college day fairs, or advocating on behalf of the University of California in Sacramento or elsewhere. Reach out to the Alumni Relations team at UC Santa Cruz to learn about more opportunities to volunteer.</p>
<h2>What's your best memory from your time at UC Santa Cruz?</h2>
<p>I have so many wonderful memories during my time at UC Santa Cruz, many stemming from the three years I lived on campus, including my last year as a Resident Assistant at Rutherford House in the Lower Quad at Crown College. But, to this day, the most vivid memory I have is my first day arriving on campus in the fall of 1973, being only 17 years old and hearing Neil Young's song "Southern Man" blaring through the open windows of the dorms at Merrill College, thinking, "Wow, this is home." &#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2014/08/volunteer-profile-panagopoulos</path><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Volunteer Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2014/08/volunteer-profile-panagopoulos</link><site>news</site><name>volunteer-profile-panagopoulos</name><display-name>Volunteer profile: Beata Panagopoulos </display-name><title>Volunteer profile: Beata Panagopoulos </title><summary>In addition to having fun, I volunteer because I would like UC Santa Cruz alums to have a strong network they can rely on after they graduate. </summary><keywords>Beata Panagopoulos </keywords><start-date>Aug 5, 2014 3:00 PM</start-date></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title>Volunteer profile: Beata Panagopoulos</title></related-links><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2014/08/volunteer-profile-lys</path><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Volunteer Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2014/08/volunteer-profile-lys</link><site>news</site><name>volunteer-profile-lys</name><display-name>Volunteer profile: Eion Lys</display-name><title>Volunteer profile: Eion Lys</title><summary>A volunteer can give back to UC Santa Cruz, experience the many social and intellectual rewards of being a Slug, and help to sustain the community life of the area where they live, all while having a good time.</summary><keywords>Eion Lys, alumni volunteer</keywords><start-date>Aug 26, 2014 12:00 AM</start-date></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title>Volunteer profile: Eion Lys</title></related-links><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2014/10/volunteer-profile-madrid</path><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Volunteer Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2014/10/volunteer-profile-madrid</link><site>news</site><name>volunteer-profile-madrid</name><display-name>Volunteer profile: John Madrid</display-name><title>Volunteer profile: John Madrid</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz was and still is a magical place for me.

the second in series of public events looking at global Islam, is set for Tuesday, February 10 at UC Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>Guest speaker for the free public event is Noah Salomon, assistant professor of religion at Carleton College, in Northfield Minn.&#160; It begins at 6:30 p.m. in Room 75 of the Social Sciences 2 building on the UC Santa Cruz campus. <br/><br/>Sudan native Mark Fathi Massoud, UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of politics and legal studies, will moderate. Massoud has written widely about South Sudan, the world&#8217;s newest nation, a land where conflict continues again after more than 23 years of civil war ended in 2005<br/><br/>The series on global Islam is organized by the UC Santa Cruz Center for Emerging Worlds, launched in September within the Anthropology Department to address conflict, environmental challenges, resource competitions, and ethnic nationalist and religious tensions in the world.

The document includes an update to our <a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/vision/index.html">campus vision</a> and lists the six goals derived from conversations with more than 1,200 campus constituents. It represents the efforts of faculty, staff, students, and community members to define our strengths and identify a shared vision for our future. I believe these goals are critical to the attainment of this vision. Through this plan we will commit to focusing our efforts on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/academic-planning/index.html">Allocating faculty resources strategically</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/research/index.html">Supporting research excellence</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/student-success/index.html">Advancing student success</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/staff-engagement/index.html">Making UC Santa Cruz a place where people enjoy working</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/reputation/index.html">Telling the world our story</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/operations/index.html">Addressing workload burden</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While developing the vision and these goals has been important, the bigger question is , <em>will we actually implement change based on these choices?</em> I am pleased to state that implementation of the plan has already begun. In the coming weeks, you will hear more about the action plans for each goal and the work done so far. In parallel, the website will be updated with details about project leads, timelines, and metrics of success. As the action plans are rolled out, you can return to the website to see specifics.<br/><br/>I encourage you to visit the <a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/">website</a> and, as you approach your work, consider how our individual and collective efforts contribute to the attainment of these goals.</p>

<h2>Nuestra visi&#243;n, nuestros objetivos, nuestro futuro</h2>
<p>5 de febrero de 2015<br/><br/>Para: la comunidad de la Universidad de California en Santa Cruz<br/>De parte de: Alison Galloway, Campus Provost y Executive Vice Chancellor<br/>Sobre: nuestra visi&#243;n, nuestros objetivos, nuestro futuro<br/><br/>Tengo el agrado de anunciar que la versi&#243;n final del Plan Estrat&#233;gico est&#225; disponible en <a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/">envision.ucsc.edu</a>. El documento incluye una actualizaci&#243;n de <a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/vision/index.html">la vision de nuestro campus</a> y enumera los seis objetivos derivados de conversaciones con m&#225;s de 1.200 constituyentes del campus.&#160; El documento representa los esfuerzos del profesorado, personal, estudiantes y miembros de la comunidad para definir nuestros puntos fuertes e identificar una visi&#243;n compartida para nuestro futuro. Creo que estos objetivos son cr&#237;ticos para el logro de nuestra visi&#243;n.<br/><br/>A trav&#233;s de este plan nos comprometeremos a enfocar nuestros esfuerzos en:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/academic-planning/index.html">Asignar estrat&#233;gicamente los recursos para el profesorado.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/research/index.html">Apoyar la excelencia en la investigaci&#243;n.</a></li>

<li><a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/operations/index.html">Abordar la cuesti&#243;n de la sobrecarga de trabajo.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Mientras que el desarrollo de la visi&#243;n y estos objetivos han sido importantes, la pregunta fundamental es: &#191;realmente implementaremos el cambio basado en estas opciones elegidas? Tengo el agrado de afirmar que la implementaci&#243;n del plan ya ha comenzado. En las semanas venideras, ustedes oir&#225;n m&#225;s sobre los planes de acci&#243;n para cada objetivo y el trabajo realizado hasta el momento.&#160; Paralelamente, el sitio web ser&#225; actualizado con los detalles de indicadores de proyecto, l&#237;neas de tiempo y m&#233;tricas de &#233;xito.

its first &#8220;<strong>LASER</strong>&#8221; talk of 2015 on Tuesday, February 10, at the Digital Arts Research Center.<br/><br/>The Leonardo Art/Science Evening Rendezvous (LASER) is a national program of evening gatherings that bring artists, scientists, and scholars together for informal presentations and conversations. <br/><br/>The goal of the series is to feature compelling new developments in the arts and sciences, and to attract audiences that would not normally be found at the same gathering.<br/><br/>The February 10 event will include presentations by four UC Santa Cruz faculty&#8212;<strong>Lewis Watts</strong> (<em>"Black Presence in France&#8212;&#8216;Paris Noir&#8217;</em>),&#8221; <strong>Noah Wardrip-Fruin</strong> (<em>&#8220;Expanding Fiction's Possibilities"</em>), <strong>Deanna Shemek</strong> (<em>&#8220;Fast-Forward Renaissance: the Science of Preserving Cultural Heritage&#8221;</em>), and <strong>Colleen Reichmuth</strong> (<em>"Exploring the Inner Worlds of Marine Mammals"</em>).<br/><br/><strong>Lewis Watts</strong> is an emeritus professor of art at UC Santa Cruz. A photographer, curator, and archivist, he examines the cultural landscape of African American communities. <br/><br/>&#8220;My talk will be on a project I'm doing about my photographic investigation of the <em>Black Presence in France (Paris Noir)</em>,&#8221; said Watts. &#8220;I went to Paris for the first time in over 40 years in 2013 to present work from my book with Eric Porter, <em>New Orleans Suite</em>, at the University of Anger/Nanes and at a Black Arts Conference in Paris.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;I was drawn to begin photographing the large critical mass of people of African descent that I saw and to make comparisons to the U.S., as well as to record the many references to African American culture that I saw all over town,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I'll be presenting images from this work-in-progress.&#8221;<br/><br/>Watts is also the author of <em>Harlem of the West: The San Francisco Fillmore Jazz Era</em> (2006), and his work has appeared in numerous exhibitions and publications.<br/><br/><strong>Noah Wardrip-Fruin</strong> is an associate professor of computer science at UC Santa Cruz and co-director of the Expressive Intelligence Studio, one of the world's largest technical research groups focused on games. He also directs the Playable Media group in UCSC's Digital Arts and New Media program. <br/><br/>&#8220;I'm planning to discuss a series of projects that use computational media to explore the possibilities for new types of fiction,&#8221; said Wardrip-Fruin. &#8220;These will range from a project that uses an immersive, room-size virtual reality display to create texts that flock around the reader's body (&#8216;Screen&#8217;), to a project that uses a new artificial intelligence approach to social modeling to create an interactive story about high school stereotypes that builds on and challenges our preconceptions (&#8216;Prom Week&#8217;).&#8221;<br/><br/>"Storytelling is one of the key ways that we understand ourselves and the world,&#8221; he added. &#8220;New forms of computational media are providing powerful new possibilities for storytelling, including ones that deeply respond to the audience. At UC Santa Cruz we are world leaders in combining arts and technology research to invent the storytelling media of the future."<br/><br/><strong>Deanna Shemek</strong> is a professor of literature at UC Santa Cruz. Her research and teaching centers on Renaissance studies and focuses on the crossroads between literary, historical, art historical, and political materials. Shemek has recently embarked on a digital humanities project aimed at preservation and creative study of the European Renaissance.<br/><br/>&#8220;This project marries the most traditional of scholarly pursuits&#8212;the editing of handwritten manuscripts&#8212;with sensibilities and technologies that mark contemporary humanities research,&#8221; said Shemek. &#8220;The focus of my endeavor is on the correspondence, collecting, and music identified with one of the most prominent female figures of the Italian Renaissance, Isabella d&#8217;Este, marchioness of Mantua. Over the years of her adult life, Isabella produced over 28,000 letters covering a wide range of topics: the art collecting that made her famous, but also government, politics, fashion, family life, food, animals, and much more.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;My team includes specialists in literary, visual, and music studies along with Web programmers and developers in the U.S., Italy, Australia, and Scotland,&#8221; Shemek added. &#8220;Our aim is to build a multi-dimensional, online environment that will allow collaboration among scholars working in the virtual archive, and to integrate this archive with an interactive, 3D recreation of her celebrated art space.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>Colleen Reichmuth</strong> heads the Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Laboratory, based at UC Santa Cruz's Long Marine Lab, where resident seals, sea lions and sea otters are trained for participation in studies about how these amphibious marine mammals acquire and process information. <br/><br/>Trained primarily as an animal behaviorist, she conducts research in the areas of comparative cognition, bioacoustics, and behavioral ecology. Reichmuth has extensive experience with laboratory and field methods addressing how animals produce, perceive, and are affected by sound, as well as expertise in operant studies of discrimination learning and emergent behavior. She also mentors graduate and undergraduate students conducting research in the areas of animal learning and sensory biology. <br/><br/>The presentations begin at 7 p.m. in the Digital Arts Research Center building (DARC--Room 108).

This addressing system was developed in conjunction with both the UCSC Police Department and what is now the Santa Cruz City Fire Department. <br/><br/>Although the initial expectation was to utilize the new addresses for mail and delivery purposes, recent developments have necessitated that we continue to use 1156 High Street. The United States Postal Service (USPS) will only accept addresses into their database if they actually deliver to that address. Since they will still only deliver to the college mailrooms and Mail Services, they will therefore not accept our new addresses. Because there are many businesses that use USPS's database to determine if an address is valid, most of the new addresses will be rejected as invalid.<br/><br/>Please continue to use your Mail Stop plus 1156 High Street as your mailing address. Mail Stops can be found using the SlugMail Locator at <a href="#">http://cmsmailserv.ucsc.edu/testweb/revised/index.php</a>.<br/><br/>The new building addresses may prove useful for providing directions, as Google Maps already has many of the addresses in its database. Over the coming months, student employees will add all new addresses to Google Maps. The new addresses can be found at http://building-address.ucsc.edu/content/ucsc-building-addresses-list.<br/><br/>If you have any questions about campus mail, please contact Campus Mail Services at (831) 459-3169 or <a href="#">info@cms.ucsc.edu</a>.<br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Jean Marie Scott, Associate Vice Chancellor Risk and Safety Services; Henry Salameh, Director Physical Plant</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6f90959380727017505ed01de1ba5c4b"><name>lick-google-gift</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Google gives Lick Observatory $1 million</title><summary>Google Inc. has given $1 million to support the University of California's Lick Observatory.</summary><keywords>Claire Max, UC Observatories, Lick Observatory</keywords><start-date>1423576800000</start-date><display-name>Google gives Lick Observatory $1 million</display-name><path>/2015/02/lick-google-gift</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/02/lick-google-gift</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1423505921401</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1425081021091</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Robert Sanders, UC Berkeley</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/lick-lh-425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/lick-lh-425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lick-lh-425.jpg</name><display-name>lick-lh-425.jpg</display-name><file-size>67513</file-size><width>425</width><height>319</height></image><image-alt>Lick Observatory</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/lick-lh-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/lick-lh-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lick-lh-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>lick-lh-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>35363</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Lick Observatory</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Lick Observatory is located atop Mt.

(Photo by <a href="http://www.lauriehatch.com">Laurie Hatch</a>)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Google Inc. has given $1 million to the University of California's Lick Observatory in what astronomers hope is the first of many private gifts to support an invaluable teaching and research resource for the state.</p>
<p>The unrestricted funds, spread over two years, will go toward general expenses, augmenting the $1.5 million the UC Office of the President gives annually to operate the mountaintop observatory for the 10-campus UC system.</p>
<p>"Lick Observatory has been making important discoveries while training generations of scientists for more than 100 years," said Chris DiBona, director of open source for Google. "Google is proud to support their efforts in 2015 to bring hands-on astronomical experiences to students and the public."</p>
<p>"We at UC highly value Lick Observatory's unique capabilities," said Claire Max, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and interim director of the University of California Observatories (UCO). Headquartered at UC Santa Cruz, UCO operates Lick and manages UC's share of the twin 10-meter W. M. Keck Telescopes in Hawaii and the planned Thirty Meter Telescope, which broke ground last year close to Keck on Mauna Kea.</p>
<p>"Lick's telescopes enable science projects that need lots of repeated observations during the course of a year or more; these can be done much more successfully at Lick than at the 8-10-meter telescopes, where observing time is extremely tight," Max said. "Google's very generous gift will make it possible for Lick to provide these opportunities and to continue to develop forefront tools such as adaptive optics, which removes image blurring caused by turbulence in Earth's atmosphere."</p>
<p>"This is very exciting," said UC Berkeley astronomy professor Alex Filippenko, who has been beating the bushes for funds to operate the observatory after UC support dropped as a result of the recent recession. "Astronomy is the 'gateway science' &#8211; kids are enthralled by cosmic discoveries, spectacular images, and far-out concepts, which can inspire them to pursue technical fields such as applied physics, engineering and computer science. So there's a real opportunity to make a difference, through the research, education and public outreach we do at Lick Observatory."</p>
<p>Lick Observatory, located atop Mt. Hamilton east of San Jose, was established in 1888 and currently houses seven telescopes, including the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope that scans the sky each night in search of exploding stars (supernovae), which help astronomers understand the accelerating expansion of the universe and dark energy. Another robotic telescope, the Automated Planet Finder, closely examines many stars each night to find planets that may be orbiting them.</p>
<p>Faculty, researchers, postdoctoral scholars, and students throughout the UC system can observe remotely on the main general-use telescopes, the three-meter Shane telescope, and the one-meter Nickel telescope. "These telescopes provide undergraduates with a unique opportunity to participate in substantial astronomical research," Filippenko said. "I have about a dozen undergraduate students doing Lick research now, many more than ever before."</p>
<p><b>Defining the cutting edge</b></p>
<p>Before the recession, Lick's budget was about $2.5 million annually to support astronomers and students from eight of the 10 UC campuses as well as the UC-managed Department of Energy labs. Most of the first 100 planets orbiting other stars were discovered at Lick using a forefront instrument designed by UC Santa Cruz astronomer Steven Vogt that was the best of its kind at the time. Lick observations also helped reveal the presence of giant black holes in the centers of galaxies. In part thanks to large numbers of relatively nearby supernovae found or studied at Lick, astronomers discovered and verified the accelerating expansion of the universe, a feat recognized with the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics to the leaders of two competing teams and the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics to all team members.</p>
<p>The telescopes are used not only for original observing in the optical and infrared, but also to design and test new instruments destined for larger telescopes, such as the 10-meter Keck telescopes. For example, laser guide star adaptive optics, which allows the world's largest telescopes to stabilize their images to improve sharpness and achieve results in some ways superior to those of the Hubble Space Telescope, was pioneered at Lick.</p>
<p>"At this time, UC is providing basic support at $1.5 million per year, but we really need at least $2.5 million per year to improve the observatory, moving forward vigorously at the cutting edge of research and education. To maintain and expand Lick in the long run, we seek an endowment of about $50 million," Filippenko said. The interest on that endowment would be used to provide annual operating funds. "This major award from Google should go far, giving us time to raise additional funds."</p>
<p>"I was delighted to learn of this wonderful gift from Google," said Aim&#233;e Dorr, UC provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. "It will do great things for the astronomical research and education that can be carried out at Lick Observatory. Congratulations to Professor Filippenko, who knows firsthand how valuable Lick is and has dedicated his considerable energy and expertise to ensuring it is available far into the future.</p>
<p>"I'm pleased that this generous award will help Lick Observatory keep its doors open to the public, to future astronomers and to the scientific community in a capacity that is simply unavailable anywhere else," said U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who previously spearheaded two letters of congressional support for Lick to the UC Office of the President. "Lick is an historic Santa Clara County landmark, and the facility has proven invaluable for students, researchers, and the Bay Area community. I hope this is the beginning of many gifts recognizing Lick Observatory's important role in inspiring future scientists and adding to our understanding of what lies beyond our solar system."</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Mike Honda, a longtime supporter and advocate for the observatory, added, "I am delighted that Google has decided to give $1 million to Lick Observatory. For 127 years, Lick Observatory has been vital in fundamental astronomical research, the development of new observational techniques, training students, and connecting the general public to the heavens. I am pleased to see private companies step up and invest in America's scientific leadership. I look forward to others joining Google to ensure that Lick Observatory will continue to explore the universe for years to come."</p>
<p>"Lick Observatory has provided critical data for University of California researchers, and Google's major support will ensure that the observatory will continue to serve as the foundation for countless scientific discoveries to come," said state Assemblymember Mark Stone.</p>
<p>One of the first uses for the money, which comes through the UC Berkeley Foundation, will be to hire another telescope operator for the Shane three-meter telescope to eliminate periodic closures caused by the current shortage of staff. Max said that another probable use of the funds will be to continue the development of laser guide star adaptive optics, which is breaking new ground at Lick Observatory.</p>
<p>Lick also recently received $350,000 in combined grants from the Heising-Simons Foundation and donors Bill and Marina Kast to enable an upgrade of the Kast spectrograph on the three-meter telescope, used to analyze faint celestial objects &#8211; including supernovae &#8211; at distances ranging from our own solar system to the far reaches of the universe.</p>
<p>"Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars can be leaders of research done at Lick," Filippenko said. "They conceive, propose, execute and complete their own projects, thereby adding immensely to their development as strong, skilled, independent research scientists. We have to keep this unique research and educational institution, a Bay Area treasure and California landmark, thriving."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.ucolick.org/SaveLick/</url><title>Save Lick Observatory</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.ucolick.org/</url><title>University of California Observatories</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7046d84e80727017505ed01dca055cc9"><name>awards-for-diversity</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2015 Chancellor's Achievement Awards for Diversity - Call for nominations</title><summary>You are invited to submit nominations for the 2015 Annual Chancellor's Achievement Awards for Diversity (CAAFD).</summary><start-date>1423468800000</start-date><display-name>2015 Chancellor's Achievement Awards for Diversity</display-name><path>/2015/02/awards-for-diversity</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/02/awards-for-diversity</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1423517866029</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1423517866029</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span face="Palatino" style="font-family: Palatino;"><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Do you know someone who has made outstanding contributions to further diversity and inclusion at UC Santa Cruz through their programs and initiatives, research, mentoring of students, faculty and staff or other efforts?<br/> &#160;<br/> You are invited to submit nominations for the 2015 Annual Chancellor's Achievement Awards for Diversity (CAAFD).&#160;

<p>A continuing goal of the UC Regents is to foster two-way communication between UC staff and the board. In January 2007, the Regents voted unanimously to establish positions for two staff advisors to participate in their deliberative process and to provide a staff perspective on matters coming before the board.</p>
<p>One new staff advisor is selected each year for a two-year term. The staff advisors serve as non-voting advisors to designated Regents' committees; they attend and participate directly in committee and board meetings throughout their term of service, and visit many of the campuses to solicit input from staff. Eligible employees interested in public policy, advocacy and understanding the future direction of the university are encouraged to apply.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>Lori Castro, Interim Assistant Vice Chancellor Staff Human Resources; Pamela Peterson, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Academic Personnel</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="707f6a0280727017505ed01d4bcb758e"><name>latham-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Focusing on adaptive change and team health to strengthen support units</title><summary>By Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services – Campus support units play critical roles in advancing the university mission.

In doing so, these units must navigate a host of competing demands, oftentimes in the face of diminished resources. Successfully navigating this territory requires using the principles of adaptive change.<br/><br/>Staff Human Resources (SHR) is undergoing a transformation utilizing an adaptive change framework. Adaptive change is a concept introduced by Ronald Heifetz and Marty Linsky, professors at Harvard University. A central concept in this model is that change must come from the collective intelligence of individuals at all levels of the organization as they learn their way toward solutions. <br/><br/>The impetus for change can come from many sources. SHR, like so many units within UC Santa Cruz, experienced deep budget cuts over the last six years, leaving them with a staff that is one-third smaller than it had been. During this time, the number of compliance requirements, service demands, and transactions has increased. In addition, there are a variety of campus and systemwide initiatives competing for time. They also experienced a 50 percent turnover of staff between March and December 2013 due to retirements and attrition. <br/><br/>SHR began their adaptive change process by first focusing on filling the vacancies within their team. They have been able to bring in a group of talented new team members to join the subject matter expertise and talent that already existed within the unit. The group then turned their attention to building and sustaining a healthy team. <br/><br/>Focusing on team health should be a priority for every unit across campus, as our most valuable resources are our human resources. SHR is using the Optum workshop series to engage in a variety of team health topics. They also have held self-care fairs to recognize the importance of taking a holistic approach to team member health and wellness. All members of the campus community have access to similar training opportunities. Check them out at <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/training/course_listings/prof-development.html">http://shr.ucsc.edu/training/course_listings/prof-development.html</a><br/><br/>Examining processes and operations has been a primary focus of the SHR unit this academic year. They have finished a series of process reviews and have made critical changes. They are currently undertaking a review of twenty process categories, ranging from leave administration to accrual management, to find opportunities for simplification and efficiency. <br/><br/>During fall quarter, the SHR team engaged in intensive outreach to clients and colleagues to partner in reviewing processes and developing solutions to optimize operations. A solution development team comprised of representatives from units across campus is concluding its work on developing recommendations for enhancing the recruitment and hiring process. <br/><br/>In November, SHR undertook an external review of Employee and Labor Relations (ELR) to develop recommendations about the structure and service delivery model of that unit. As a follow-up, the team hosted a series of client roundtables to gain the perspectives of colleagues across campus as to how the ELR unit can best support campus needs in this area. Partnering in this way is a critical aspect of the adaptive change model.<br/><br/>In fall quarter, SHR hosted an open house for the campus community. This was an opportunity to enhance communication, discuss departmental initiatives, talk about core functions, and engage with clients in a new way.&#160; Building transparency and relationships are both important elements of adaptive change. &#160;<br/><br/>I recently received an email from a colleague outlining the positive experience they had with SHR this month. In the note, the writer said it was a positive "holistic" experience. That term really represents what we are trying to achieve in SHR. In the end, it is not just about processes but also about the holistic experience of our clients. I commend SHR for the advances they have made, and I hope you all will continue to engage with us as we navigate the path ahead.<br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="754c826080727017505ed01da580a857"><name>quarry-field</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus farm adds Quarry Field to further farming, education, and research</title><summary>Freshly tilled soil on the west side of Hagar marks the start of the UC Santa Cruz Farm’s latest effort in growing food for campus and expanding the research and education work of the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS). </summary><start-date>1423602000000</start-date><display-name>Quarry Field </display-name><path>/2015/02/quarry-field</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/02/quarry-field</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1423602123334</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1423615686568</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title></title><phone/><email>mtbrown</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/quarry-field-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/quarry-field-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>quarry-field-500.jpg</name><display-name>quarry-field-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>83374</file-size><width>500</width><height>307</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/quarry-field-2-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/quarry-field-2-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>quarry-field-2-80.jpg</name><display-name>quarry-field-2-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>22202</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Darryl Wong, UCSC farm site and research lands manager, tills the new three-acre Quarry Field in anticipation of planting wheat before the rains.

This winter, Darryl Wong, CASFS farm site and research lands manager, tilled the field and planted seven varieties of wheat ahead of last weekend's rainstorm.<br/><br/>&#8220;With the increased interest in locally produced grains, we want to see how different varieties perform here,&#8221; Wong said. The plantings include three varieties from other California growers, and four types that produced well last year in the Farm&#8217;s Hay Barn field. &#8220;Our hope is to produce wheat for local bakeries, such as Companion Bakeshop, along with UC Santa Cruz Dining Services,&#8221; he said. <br/><br/>Along with growing food, the field will offer students working with CASFS and Environmental Studies classes a place for hands-on farming experiences, and adds additional research acreage for those interested in studying organic production practices.<br/><br/>A generous grant from the Stocker Family Fund of the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County is supporting the Quarry Field&#8217;s development for farming. Wong anticipates that a fence to protect the field from grazing deer will be installed by summer, and interpretive signage is also planned. For now, crops will be grown with available rainfall, although an irrigation line is planned.<br/><br/>The 3-acre Quarry Field site was carefully selected to avoid impacting native plants, including Purple Needlegrass (<em>Nassella pulchra</em>), which grows abundantly in the area of the meadow closer to Coolidge Drive.<br/><br/>With the addition of the Quarry Field, the UC Santa Cruz Farm now encompasses 33 acres of farm fields, gardens, and orchards, along with lab space, a small classroom, and offices. <br/><br/>Founded in 1971, the Farm hosts a diversity of education programs, classes and internships for UCSC students, and, along with the Alan Chadwick Garden, is one of the training grounds for participants in the annual Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, now in its 48th year. The Farm was recently <a href="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/best-university-farms/">ranked 7th in a review of the nation&#8217;s college farms</a> by Best College Reviews.<br/><br/>The Hay Barn Field and Quarry Field were originally annexed to the UC Santa Cruz Farm about 10 years ago to compensate for land used by the Ranch View Terrace housing development. Located up the hill from Coolidge Drive, the Hay Barn Field was brought into production in 2014 and now grows a variety of crops for campus Dining Services as well as serving as a research and education site for CASFS. The adjacent Cowell Ranch Hay Barn is currently being rebuilt to house CASFS offices, classrooms,&#160; and other South Campus activities.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://casfs.ucsc.edu</url><title>Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/best-university-farms/</url><title>List of best college farms</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="759d521780727017505ed01da6644521"><name>haussler-prize</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Genomics Institute director David Haussler awarded prestigious Dan David Prize </title><summary>Haussler will share a $1 million prize with two other leaders in bioinformatics.</summary><keywords>David Haussler, Genomics Institute, Dan David Prize</keywords><start-date>1423555200000</start-date><display-name>Genomics Institute director David Haussler awarded prestigious Dan David Prize </display-name><path>/2015/02/haussler-prize</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/02/haussler-prize</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1423607419379</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1431733614932</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/prize-scrnshot-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/prize-scrnshot-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>prize-scrnshot-450.jpg</name><display-name>prize-scrnshot-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>63686</file-size><width>450</width><height>253</height></image><image-alt>David Haussler</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/Haussler-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/Haussler-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Haussler-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>Haussler-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20016</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>David Haussler</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Haussler will share $1 million prize with two other leaders in bioinformatics</article-subhead><article-text><p>David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the <a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">Genomics Institute</a> at UC Santa Cruz, has been chosen to receive the Dan David Prize, a prestigious international award endowed by the Dan David Foundation and based at Tel Aviv University. Haussler will share the $1 million prize with two other leaders in the field of bioinformatics.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dandavidprize.org/">Dan David Prize</a> recognizes and encourages innovative and interdisciplinary research that cuts across traditional boundaries and paradigms. It aims to foster universal values of excellence, creativity, justice, democracy and progress and to promote the scientific, technological and humanistic achievements that advance and improve our world. Haussler and the other laureates will be honored at a ceremony in Tel Aviv on May 17, 2015.</p>
<p>The prize recognizes human achievement in three areas: the past (fields that expand knowledge of former times); the present (achievements that shape and enrich society today); and the future (breakthroughs that hold great promise for improvement of our world). Each year an international board chooses one field within each time dimension.</p>
<p>In addition to Haussler, the 2015 laureates for the future time dimension in the field of bioinformatics are Michael Waterman, a professor of biological sciences, computer science, and mathematics at the University of Southern California, and Cyrus Chothia, an emeritus scientist at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, U.K.</p>
<p>Joseph Klafter, president of Tel Aviv University and chair of the Dan David Prize Board, said in a <a href="http://youtu.be/8BkngIuVqIg">video announcement of the prize laureates</a>, "Professor David Haussler presented the first draft of the human genome sequence and developed the Genome Browser used worldwide for interpreting genome sequences. The browser includes tools for identifying and comparing genes, for accessing information on gene structure, function, and regulation, and for revealing gene-disease relationships. Dr. Haussler introduced machine learning techniques to bioinformatics, becoming a central paradigm in the field."</p>
<p>The 2015 prize for Retrieving the Past: Historians and their Sources will be shared by historians Peter Brown and Alessandro Portelli, and the prize for the Present: The Information Revolution will be given to Jimmy Wales, cofounder of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Haussler is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and has received many awards and honors for his work, including the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/06/haussler-weldon-prize.html">2011 Weldon Memorial Prize</a> given by the University of Oxford. In 2009, he shared the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/09/3231.html">Curt Stern Award</a> from the American Society of Human Genetics with James Kent, a research scientist in the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute who played a central role in assembling the first working draft of the human genome sequence and developing the UCSC Genome Browser.</p>
<p>Haussler joined the UCSC faculty in 1986. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/haussler-big-data.html</url><title>UC Santa Cruz leads $11 million Center for Big Data in Translational Genomics</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/06/global-alliance.html</url><title>Genomics pioneers look to future, form global alliance for data sharing</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="79f2437580727017505ed01dd136995d"><name>auto-burglary-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update: Auto burglary suspect arrested</title><summary>On January 27, 2015 at 6:40 a.m., UC Santa Cruz Police Department officers arrested Patrick Sizemore and Emily Barnett on a suspicion of auto burglary.</summary><start-date>1423641600000</start-date><display-name>Update: Auto burglary suspect arrested</display-name><path>/2015/02/auto-burglary-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/02/auto-burglary-update</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1423680095068</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1423686389589</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>On January 27, 2015 at 6:40 a.m., UC Santa Cruz Police Department officers arrested Patrick Sizemore and Emily Barnett on a suspicion of auto burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary and unlawful possession of hypodermic needles. While Sizemore was booked into the Santa Cruz County Jail, Barnett was cited and released at the hospital where she was taken for emergency medical treatment.<br/><br/>At the time of Barnett's arrest and release, she intentionally provided a false name and presented herself as another person. It was later determined Barnett gave false information. Since then, UC Santa Cruz officers have been actively seeking and following various leads to locate and arrest Barnett.<br/><br/>As a result of these investigative efforts, UC Santa Cruz officers located and arrested Barnett Feb. 10 at 4:30pm in the 2700 block of 41st Avenue in Soquel. Barnett was booked into the Santa Cruz County Jail on a suspicion of burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, receiving stolen goods, providing false information to a police officer, false impersonation of another person, and outstanding felony warrants.<br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Nader Oweis, UC Santa Cruz Chief of Police</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7a15ae4680727017505ed01d203a7597"><name>napolitano-at-ano</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC President Napolitano visits Año Nuevo Island Reserve</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz scientists gave Napolitano a tour of the elephant seal colony at Año Nuevo.</summary><keywords>Daniel Costa, elephant seals</keywords><start-date>1423641600000</start-date><display-name>UC President Napolitano visits Año Nuevo Island Reserve</display-name><path>/2015/02/napolitano-at-ano</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/02/napolitano-at-ano</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1423682416165</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1423682724693</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/napolitano-costa.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/napolitano-costa.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>napolitano-costa.jpg</name><display-name>napolitano-costa.jpg</display-name><file-size>236085</file-size><width>750</width><height>587</height></image><image-alt>Janet Napolitano and Dan Costa</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/napolitano-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/napolitano-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>napolitano-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>napolitano-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27437</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Janet Napolitano</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz marine biologist Daniel Costa discussed his elephant seal research at A&#241;o Nuevo Island Reserve with UC President Janet Napolitano.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC President Janet Napolitano got up close and personal recently with a colony of northern elephant seals and the UC Santa Cruz scientists who study these marine mammals at the UC Natural Reserve System's A&#241;o Nuevo Island Reserve.</p>

Both men were booked into Santa Cruz County Jail. There were about 30 witnesses to the incident.<br/><br/>After dispersing the crowd, officers found four male victims with non-life threatening injuries.<br/><br/>Although the investigation is ongoing, follow up investigation and interviews revealed the fight broke out because one or more of the suspects perceived that one or more of the victims belonged to a protected classification, as listed in the California Hate Crime Statues. The student suspect and the victims were living in the same college community.<br/><br/>Protected classifications include, but are not limited to the following characteristics of the victim:<br/>&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Disability <br/>&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Gender <br/>&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Nationality <br/>&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Sexual orientation <br/>&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Race or ethnicity<br/>&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Religion <br/>&#160;&#160; &#160;&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.<br/>Anyone who may be a witness to this hate crime or has any information regarding these crimes is encouraged to call the UC Santa Cruz Police Department at 831-459-2231, ext.1.<br/><br/><br/>Safety Tips<br/>No action or inaction by a crime victim makes that person responsible for his or her victimization.

million saw her testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Judge Clarence Thomas.<br/><br/>Her calm demeanor--as she was pressed to endlessly repeat the graphic descriptions of sexual harassment she endured while working for Thomas--struck a chord with the public and began a conversation about sexual harassment and power in the workplace that still resonates today.&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>Now an author and professor of law, public policy, and women&#8217;s studies at Brandeis University, Hill comes to UC Santa Cruz on Thursday, February 26, to deliver a free public lecture on the topic: &#8220;S<em>peaking Truth to Power: Gender and Racial Equality, 1991-2015.</em>&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>In a telephone interview</strong> from her office in Boston, Hill recalled the groundbreaking hearings that took place 23 years ago in Congress.<br/><br/>&#8220;The experience itself was surreal beyond anything that I think anybody could have prepared for,&#8221; said Hill. &#8220;The committee had already voted on the candidacy and nobody really wanted to have a second hearing--there was antagonism to my testifying on both sides, whether it was Democrats or Republicans. It wasn&#8217;t until the public demanded a hearing that I got to even be there.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;I was really there to testify about the character of Clarence Thomas--I wasn&#8217;t there to declare that I was sexually harassed,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It was a fact-finding hearing. But people to this day think that I was on trial because of the tone set by the Senate committee. How (then Senator) Joe Biden allowed the issue to be framed gave people the entirely wrong impression, and it gave the Republicans license to treat me in the way that they did.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>A new documentary film</strong> released last March by Academy Award winner Frieda Mock titled <em>Anita:</em> <em>Speaking Truth to Power</em> captures the absurdity of the hearing that took place in an era when sexual harassment in the workplace was not yet a national issue. <br/><br/>&#8220;When students watch the hearing in the movie, they&#8217;re stunned,&#8221; Hill noted. &#8220;It seems to them like that must have been at least 50 or 60 years ago--that it couldn&#8217;t have happened within the lifetimes of people they know, or in their parents&#8217; lifetime. It&#8217;s hard for them to believe it.&#8221; <br/><br/>In conjunction with Hill&#8217;s talk on campus, the documentary will be screened in downtown Santa Cruz at the Nickelodeon Theater on February 22 and 23.</p>
<p><strong>After the hearings,</strong> Hill began speaking to worldwide audiences about how to build on the progress of the women&#8217;s and civil rights movements, urging them to expand their concept of equality to include more than just legal rights. She also wrote her autobiography <em>Speaking Truth to Power</em> in 1995.</p>
<p>Four years ago, she followed with another book <em>Reimagining Equality: Stories of Gender, Race and Finding Home</em> about the subprime meltdown, examining the deep roots of race and gender inequities that contributed to the devastation of families and communities across the country.</p>
<p>But despite the persistence today of entrenched sexual harassment and racial discrimination, Hill&#8212;who in 1989 became the first African American to be tenured at the University of Oklahoma, College of Law&#8212;still remains hopeful about the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;I grew up in a household, the youngest of 13 children,&#8221; said Hill. &#8220;My mother was born in 1911 and my father in 1912, in rural areas of Arkansas and Oklahoma respectively. They raised children, some of whom were raised in Jim Crow segregation, and daughters who were legally discriminated against. That was part of their reality. But my mother insisted that we all get educated and get prepared for the possibility of doing all these things women weren&#8217;t allowed to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve seen change, not only in my lifetime, but in my siblings lifetime, and in my parents&#8217; lifetime. And that&#8217;s what I keep holding on to.&#8221;</p>

Smith, a Ph.D. candidate in the UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies Department. &#8220;We found that female pumas spent less time feeding at kill sites as housing increases.&#8221; <br/><br/>The effects can impact deer populations as well as puma breeding success, Smith and her coauthors <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1802/20142711%20">write in the journal <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em></a>. &#8220;Females killed 36 percent more deer per year in developed habitats than in areas with little housing,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;Increased kill rates may lead carnivores to waste energy and also influence prey survival rates in human-modified landscapes.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;We conclude that food loss and high energy costs due to human avoidance at kill sites is compensated for by increasing kill rates,&#8221; she said. <br/><br/>Smith, and co-authors Yiwei Wang, a recent UC Santa Cruz Ph.D graduate, and Chris Wilmers, associate professor of environmental studies, are part of the Santa Cruz Puma Project that has studied puma behavior since 2008. <br/><br/>For this study they looked at the actions of 30 animals that had been captured and later released with GPS monitoring collars. The collars record and transmit not only location and travels but also hunting behavior such as bursts of speed or pounces. <br/><br/>The team found that the greatest impact on pumas was when their hunting territories were within 150 meters of human development. They also found that females have a smaller range than males but higher kill rates. Females killed an average 67 deer per year compared with nearly 44 for males whose ranges are approximately three times as large.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZLpJ5YCYg&amp;feature=youtu.be</url><title>Video of female puma 29F trying to drag a deer kill away from a house</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1802/20142711 </url><title>'Top carnivores increase their kill rates on prey as a response to human-induced fear'</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://santacruzpumas.org/</url><title>Santa Cruz Puma Project</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8060e5c780727017505ed01db66a5181"><name>galloway-hate</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Hate crime investigation</title><summary>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway writes to the campus community about an incident on campus that is being investigated as a hate crime.</summary><keywords>hate, crime, fight, suspects, victim, injury</keywords><start-date>1423728000000</start-date><display-name>Galloway-Hate</display-name><path>/2015/02/galloway-hate</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/02/galloway-hate</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1423788008870</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1423788112952</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>Unit Managers: Please post a paper copy of this message in your area for people who do not have regular computer access.</em></p>
<p>I am deeply distressed by news of a fight on campus last Friday night that resulted in injuries to four students. Two suspects, including one student, have been arrested in the case, which police are investigating as a potential hate crime.<br/><br/>The gravity of this incident is disturbing, and the allegation of a hate crime is particularly troubling. As a campus, we welcome students, staff, faculty, and guests of all races, religions, ethnic groups, nationalities, traditions, backgrounds, orientations, physical abilities, and cultures. Targeting a victim because of his or her perceived membership in a particular group is unacceptable&#8212;and illegal. I want to assure the campus community that we are investigating this hate-crime allegation with the seriousness it deserves. <br/><br/>This news is upsetting, and resources are available to support anyone in need. Personal counseling and support services are available to students through the <a href="http://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/index.html">Cowell Student Health Center</a>. Staff and faculty can find support through the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/">Employee Assistance Program</a>. The Office of Harassment and Discrimination, Prevention and Investigation Unit can also provide assistance to students and employees; information is available <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/">online</a>. <br/><br/>This campus takes reports of hate/bias incidents seriously. The University Hate/Bias Response Team reviews all such reports and provides support and referral services. Reports can be made to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department or online at <a href="http://reporthate.ucsc.edu">reporthate.ucsc.edu</a>.<br/><br/>Please join me in condemning this violence. I also ask you to consider how you might contribute to building a campus community that values diversity in all its forms. One opportunity is to participate in a Principles of Community workshop; details are available <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html">online</a>.<br/><br/>If you have any information about this incident, please contact UCSC Police immediately at (831) 459-2231. Reports may also be made anonymously by calling 459-3TIP (459-3847).<br/><br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="843e6a0780727017505ed01d777c60f7"><name>hummingbird-days</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Arboretum holds annual Hummingbird Days March 7-8</title><summary>Tiny birds make a big impression with aerial acrobatics at this family-oriented event.</summary><keywords>Arboretum, Hummingbird Days, hummingbirds</keywords><start-date>1424160000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz Arboretum holds annual Hummingbird Days March 7-8</display-name><path>/2015/02/hummingbird-days</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/02/hummingbird-days</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1423852857813</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1424191207156</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/anna-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/anna-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>anna-400.jpg</name><display-name>anna-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>77252</file-size><width>400</width><height>277</height></image><image-alt>Anna's hummingbird</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/allen-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/allen-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>allen-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>allen-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24532</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Allen's hummingbird</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>An Anna's hummingbird feeds from Grevillea flowers at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum.

the Jewish Imagination&#8221;</strong></em> on campus February 18-19, at the Humanities 1 Building.</p>
<p>The Venice Ghetto will serve as the starting point for the conference to address questions of&#160;modern Jewish spaces and identity. The site has played a central role in Jewish and European&#160;culture since the Jews were first sequestered in the Ghetto in 1516.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Venice is the place where the Jews in the modern world got their first location&#8212;not by choice,&#8221; noted Murray Baumgarten, professor of literature and co-director of the Jewish Studies program at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were located there when they were forced out of Spain. The Ghetto is still there in Venice as an island, and we are looking at how it has impacted modern Jewish life and European life,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The conference is being coordinated by Katie Trostel, a UC Santa Cruz graduate student in literature, who attended an international workshop for young researchers last summer in Jerusalem at the Van Leer Institute, Israel&#8217;s Center for the Humanities and Social Sciences.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re taking ideas from that workshop and expanding it to a conference with presentations,&#8221; said Trostel.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all coming from very different disciplinary backgrounds. It&#8217;s a global conversation. People are coming from Russia and Scotland.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conference will include panels on <i>Sculptural and Literary Israeli Space, European Jewish Spaces, American Jewish Spaces, and Virtual Jewish Spaces. </i></p>
<p>During her presentation, Trostel will talk about an author exiled from Argentina, who was able to better understand her own experience by thinking about Jewish exiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;She fled to Mexico where she interacted with European Jewish exiles,&#8221; said Trostel. &#8220;Even though she was not Jewish, she found she had a lot in common with them, learning what it means to build a community of exiles. It all goes back to space, the communities of the lost home. What it shows is that identity is never isolated. It&#8217;s always in relation to things that are alive and defined.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The implications of where you live shape your identity,&#8221; Trostel noted. &#8220;A political situation is always implied when you talk about space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trostel added that the conference is designed to bring new perspectives and a new way of talking about situations, often changing the way we understand them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We made lots of new relationships at the Van Leer institute in Jerusalem with young scholars, grad students, and recently graduated students,&#8221; she noted. &#8220;We now have a network of international future colleagues which is inspiring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always nice to see what people from other institutions are working on and sharing ideas,&#8221; Trostel added.&#160; &#8220;At UC Santa Cruz, we are fortunate to have an open field where we can be innovative and come up with new ideas.&#8221;</p>

A six-session docent training begins on Tuesday, March 10.&#160;</p>
<p>Docents lead tours for visitors to the 33-acre organic farm at UC Santa Cruz. Perched on a campus hillside with sweeping views of Monterey Bay, the farm hosts a wide variety of education, research, and community programs, and is open to the public daily. If you enjoy gardening, learning about food and farming issues, and sharing your enthusiasm and knowledge with others, this is a wonderful chance to join our dynamic team of volunteers.</p>
<p>The 2015 Farm &amp; Garden docent-training program will take place on the UC Santa Cruz Farm on six Tuesday afternoons from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm, beginning March 10 and ending April 14.</p>
<p>During the training sessions, participants will learn about organic farming and gardening practices, the history of the Alan Chadwick Garden and the UCSC Farm, and the research and education work of UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), which manages the Farm &amp; Garden programs and facilities. There is no pre-requisite to become a docent&#8212;just a willingness to learn and share.</p>
<p>After completing the training, docents are asked to lead a minimum of six tours a year and are encouraged to help with public education events, plants sales, and other efforts that support the Farm &amp; Garden&#8217;s community outreach work. Docents will also enjoy ongoing, free enrichment workshops on a variety of topics.&#160;</p>
<p>Cost of the docent training is $20 for current Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, and $50 for non-members, plus a $15 materials fee. The initial session on March 10 is free and fees only apply to those who continue with the training. Campus parking costs will be covered during the training.</p>
<p>Active docents receive a yearly membership to the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, which includes discounts at plant sales and local nurseries. Docents also receive free admission to many of the Friends&#8217; gardening and fruit tree care workshops.</p>
<p>For more details and to arrange for parking during the training, please contact Amy Bolton at 831.459-3240, or <a href="mailto:jonitann@ucsc.edu">abolton@ucsc.edu</a> by Tuesday, March 3. The training is sponsored by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems at UC Santa Cruz.

If you google "big data in the news," you&#8217;ll find a surprisingly large number of articles published in the past few hours. I did. I stopped counting at 20. <br/><br/>What I found truly interesting, in addition to the sheer number of articles, was the almost comical variety of headlines. From "Six ways big data could damage your business" to "Six ways big data can make you a better chief marketing officer,&#8221; it&#8217;s easy to believe that big data really does have something (or six things) for everyone. <br/><br/>But what is big data? And why, beyond all the hype, is it important? <br/><br/>For starters, the term "big data" is now generally considered pass&#233;. I think that&#8217;s a good thing, because it's never been just about the size of the data. It&#8217;s about what insights can be drawn from the data once it&#8217;s been interpreted. Interpretation, however, is a challenge. It&#8217;s not only the scale that&#8217;s a problem, it&#8217;s the complexity as well. Data is messy. It comes in many different formats and fragments through many different sensors and sensing devices. <br/><br/>What we&#8217;re interested in at UC Santa Cruz is the science of data: how data can be gathered, structured, organized, managed, interpreted, and applied. And what makes this important is it gives us powerful new ways to address challenging problems. It allows us to ask new questions about complex systems, from the evolution of the universe to the most efficient routing of city buses. It will likely be an integral part of how we address challenges like Ebola and the distribution of basic resources, such as food and water. <br/><br/>The data science we at UCSC are particularly interested in is focused on quality research and education, grounded in ethics and social responsibility&#8212;data science for social good. To do this, we need to build deeper and more robust computational and mathematical foundations. We need methods that alert users to potential bias and help users make the most informed decisions possible. And we need to train a generation of responsible data scientists. <br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz is an established leader in the data science revolution, driven for decades by our leadership in astronomy, genomics, and other data-intense fields. We&#8217;re known for developing new computational, algorithmic, and analytic theory. With this existing expertise, and with a growing data science research portfolio and curriculum, we&#8217;ll continue to train future data scientists in the thoughtful collection, management, and use of data. <br/><br/>Our goal is to model a future that respects issues of privacy, security, and the powers and limitations of data. Researchers and advocates on the frontlines of environmental protection, education, health care, and political action are being deluged by newly available data, including socio-behavioral data and its impact on things like sustainability and civic engagement. They will benefit from working with data scientists with strong skill sets and a shared commitment to the greater good. Businesses&#8212;constantly striving to develop better products and services, and to improve customers&#8217; experience&#8212;will also benefit from strong foundational methods and responsible data scientists. <br/><br/>We invite you to get involved!

<br/>
The campus is actively exploring a long-term lease of the facility and conducting due diligence on the building. Working with the unions that represent involved employees will begin soon.<br/>
<br/>
The Enterprise Technology Centre, 100 Enterprise Way, was built by the software company Borland in 1993 to serve as its main campus. The company sold the complex in 2000.<br/>
<br/>
UC Santa Cruz long ago outgrew available office space on campus and for several years has leased space in off-site buildings on the west side of Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
There are clear benefits to having employees centralized in one location, such as increased collaboration and shared infrastructure. We also know it's a big change to consider and that exploring this opportunity comes with some uncertainty.<br/>
<br/>
There are many aspects to consider to make a fully informed decision, and it won't be made lightly. The three of us are serving on a committee that is evaluating the impacts and ways to reduce them.<br/>

<p>One of the important things we learned about our campus from the recent <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/03/climate-survey-message.html" moz-do-not-send="true">systemwide campus climate survey</a> is that UC Santa Cruz has work to do to create a fully welcoming and supportive experience for all students.</p>
<p>The campus climate survey and our hate/bias reports over the last 18 months reveal that members of our community of African American/Black/Caribbean (ABC) students have been the targets of hate/bias incidents and harassment. During a recent town hall meeting with Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway, ABC students described their experiences of racism and race-based microaggressions; their accounts were disturbing to hear but important to acknowledge.</p>
<p>Last week, campus leaders reached out to town hall participants and the African American Resource and Cultural Center (AARCC) with a list of actions they are considering, including but not limited to additional training of faculty, staff, and incoming students, and enhancing efforts to recruit ABC students. All such actions are designed to move the campus forward in improving the campus climate for ABC students. We look forward to receiving widespread input as we prioritize actions and plan a campuswide strategy.</p>
<p>This dialogue builds on work begun last summer by the Black Experience Team (BET), a special working group charged with advising campus leaders and developing recommendations on a broad range of issues impacting ABC students, including graduation and retention rates, academic support services, and the hate/bias incident reporting process.</p>
<p>I appreciate the efforts of dedicated student, staff, and faculty members who are partnering with us in this work, including representatives from Admissions; the Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; the African American Resource and Cultural Center; Residential Life; and many others on campus.</p>
<p>This campus is deeply committed to improving the climate for all students at UC Santa Cruz, and I am confident that the work taking place to address the specific, immediate needs of ABC students will benefit the entire student population. Our <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html" moz-do-not-send="true">Principles of Community</a> provide a roadmap, shining a light on our destination. Please join us, so that we may embark on this journey together.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>As the world deals with the aftermath of the Islamic terror attack on the French satirical magazine <em>Charlie Hebdo</em>, UC Santa Cruz anthropology professor Mayanthi Fernando&#8217;s new book, <em>The Republic Unsettled: Muslim French and the Contradictions of Secularism</em>, (Duke University Press, 2014) provides insight to understanding Islamic culture and secularism in contemporary France.<br/><br/>Fernando combines ethnographic observations with political analysis to illustrate that secularism or la&#239;cit&#233; &#8211; what the French call the political separation of church and state &#8211; is far from a neutral concept. Fernando shows how French Muslims carry the burden of secularism&#8217;s contradictions.</p>
<p><strong>La&#239;qu&#233; republic</strong></p>
<p>In 1905, France was constitutionally declared to be a la&#239;qu&#233; republic, a country where religion and politics are fully separate. The law includes that no government organization (including public schools) can promote religious dogma of any kind. Communal prayers, religious assemblies or crosses on walls are not allowed in government buildings or schools. More recently in 2004, even wearing conspicuous religious symbols in public schools was forbidden: no Christian crosses, Jewish yarmulkes, or Muslim headscarves and veils.<br/><br/>Fernando shows that while Christian or Jewish garb was banned but often tolerated in public schools, the Muslim headscarf was deemed as an assault to French identity. It represented an attack on feminism, a symbol of submission and foreignness. She describes how the debate reassigned Islamic faith into immigrant Arab and North African categories, thus loading it with racial and xenophobic connotations. Instead of just being freedom of religion, la&#239;cit&#233; has come to be used as a political tool representing freedom from the alien, foreign and the &#8220;un-French.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#160;In an era defined by globalization and an international flow of ideas, information and people, the French political and media elite perceive la&#239;cit&#233; as under threat. As Fernando shows, la&#239;cit&#233; requires a continual political renewal by the state. She writes: &#8220;Secularism is a historically evolving, normative project of government that entails the administrative intervention into and transformation of what are called, retroactively, religious traditions, institutions and sensibilities.&#8221; &#160;<br/><br/>This government intervention makes la&#239;cit&#233; inherently contradictory, Fernando says. How can there be separation of church and state when the government is always intervening in religious affairs? And who is the government intervening against? And adding to the complexity of the problem, what is the ideal, when la&#239;cit&#233; has always disproportionately favored the Christian majority?</p>
<p><strong>Regionally exempt from la&#239;cit&#233;</strong></p>
<p>Fernando points to the Alsace-Moselle region, an area exempt from la&#239;cit&#233; altogether. The region officially recognizes Catholicism, Calvinism, Lutheranism, and Judaism and even uses government funds to pay for religious education and clergy. But when Muslims demand equal treatment, they are accused of thinking too much like Muslims and not enough like French citizens. Fernando <a href="http://theconversation.com/the-french-myth-of-secularism-36227">wrote an opinion article "The French Myth of Secularism" for the online site <em>The Conversation </em></a>about this dynamic in light of the Charlie Hebdo attack).<br/><br/>&#160;Fernando complements her deep theoretical exploration with her own experience of living in the country as a teacher. She draws on conversations with her Muslim students, many of them the children of immigrants, who share their personal struggle of wearing the hijab in public.<br/><br/>&#160;By journeying into the secular life and conversing in intimate and everyday spaces, Fernando is able to tease out the disruption, the &#8220;unsettling&#8221; of the French Republic. By taking Muslim and secular life seriously, Fernando&#8217;s book is as much a study on national identity and French politics as it about Muslim French.<br/><br/>&#160;Fernando is organizing a public lecture series at UC Santa Cruz in April and May on sex and religion in American politics and culture.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://theconversation.com/the-french-myth-of-secularism-36227</url><title>The

host a major national conference on climate change on Friday and Saturday, March 13 and 14, featuring top climate scientists and policy experts from across the country in a series of talks and panel discussions.</p>
<p>"No Prospect of an End: Living with an Ever Changing Climate" is the second annual UC Santa Cruz Climate and Policy Conference, co-sponsored by the UCSC divisions of <a href="http://pbsci.ucsc.edu/">Physical and Biological Sciences</a> and <a href="http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/">Social Sciences</a>. The event is free and open to the public. Advance registration is required (go to <a href="http://pbsci.ucsc.edu/2015-climate-conference/index.html">pbsci.ucsc.edu/2015-climate-conference</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Keynote speaker</strong></p>
<p>The event kicks off Friday evening with a lecture by eminent Earth scientist <b>Richard Alley</b>, the Evan Pugh Professor of Geosciences at Pennsylvania State University. Alley, a leading expert on the Earth's ice sheets and glaciers, has made extensive contributions to the scientific understanding of climate change, served on numerous advisory panels, and received many prominent awards for research, teaching, and science communication. Host of the PBS miniseries <i>Earth: The Operators' Manual,</i> he has been described as "a cross between Woody Allen and Carl Sagan." Alley will discuss "Big Challenges and Bigger Opportunities on Climate Change and Energy."</p>
<p>Scientists now recognize that without dramatic reductions of greenhouse gas emissions from human sources, climate and environments may be changing for thousands of years into the future. From a societal perspective, climate change would seem to be never ending, and predicting environmental conditions in the future "hot house" world would be very difficult.</p>
<p>"At the conference, we want to explore how societies can plan for and reach a future where humans and the natural systems on which they depend are flourishing, not just a century from now, but far into the future," said Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences.</p>
<p><strong>Panel discussions</strong></p>
<p>On Saturday, March 14, there will be two panel discussions featuring climate scientists, civil servants, economists, and educators. The first panel, on "Coastal Resilience: Weathering the Coming Storm," will address the impacts of climate change and sea level rise on coastal areas. UC Santa Cruz coastal ecologist Mark Carr, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, will serve as moderator, and the panelists will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Eron Bloomgarden</b>, EKO Asset Management Partners</li>
<li><b>Kerry Emanuel</b>, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</li>
<li><b>Charles Lester</b>, California Coastal Commission</li>
<li><b>Susanne&#160; Moser</b>, Stanford University</li>
<li><b>Rob Young</b>, Western Carolina University &#160;</li>
</ul>
<p>The afternoon panel will address "Wicked Tradeoffs: Unavoidable Tradeoffs Between Food, Water, Energy, and Biodiversity." Moderated by Daniel Press, the Griswold Professor of Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz, the five-member panel will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Renata Brillinger</b>, California Climate and Agriculture Network</li>
<li><b>Noah Diffenbaugh</b>, Stanford University</li>
<li><b>Ellen Hanak</b>, Public Policy Institute of California</li>
<li><b>Lara Hansen</b>, EcoAdapt</li>
<li><b>Daniel Schrag</b>, Harvard University Center for the Environment</li>
</ul>
<p>The conference will be held in the College 9/10 Multipurpose Room. Additional information is available online at <a href="http://pbsci.ucsc.edu/2015-climate-conference/index.html">pbsci.ucsc.edu/2015-climate-conference</a>.</p>

One of our traditions is to present annual awards to students, staff, and faculty who accomplish great things as champions of diversity.<br/><br/>Past recipients tell me that receiving a <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/caafd/index.html">Chancellor's Achievement Award for Diversity</a> (CAAFD) holds great meaning for them. One recipient, Sociology Professor Hiroshi Fukurai, said he considers the award one of the most important awards at UCSC&#8212;and perhaps at any campus. Recipients frequently mention that the award energized them and reaffirmed their commitment to diversity work. And virtually everyone says the award ceremony itself was a meaningful moment during which they saw themselves as part of a bigger, more impactful community than they'd realized.<br/><br/>More than 80 awards have been presented since the CAAFD awards were established in 2003; past recipients are noted <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/caafd/index.html">online</a>. Contemplating the collective on-campus impact of these champions of diversity is heartening. Contributions from the 2014 recipients include working with community-based organizations that collaborate with campus units to advance students of color, mentoring women and minorities in the STEM fields, creating intersectional dialogues around queer students and other marginalized communities, advancing our teaching mission by incorporating topics on race and the law, and advancing the work of graduate students in the field of Latin American literacy and cultural studies. <br/><br/>The ripple effects of UCSC's commitment to diversity are profound off campus, as well. Lesley-Reid Harrison received a 2014 diversity award as an undergraduate and is now working as a coordinator at the Diversity Center of Santa Cruz County. Another undergraduate recipient last year, Wisdom Cole, was recognized for his role as co-chair of the African Black Coalition conference that was founded at UCSC in 2003 and returned to Santa Cruz a year ago this month. The conference attracted more than 500 black students and alumni from across the state to talk about issues in higher education. <br/><br/>Individually, awardees are contributing to the creation of a healthy living and learning environment at UCSC. Collectively, they are part of this university's institutional excellence, supporting innovation, problem solving, and our commitment to making the world a better place. A past recipient, Assistant Manager Madlyn Norman-Terrance in Employee and Labor Relations, said it best by noting that valuing diversity is an ongoing daily aspect of our working and learning environment.<br/><br/>The diversity awards are sponsored by the Chancellor's Office, the Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI), and Staff Human Resources. <br/><br/>We are now <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/caafd/caafd_announcement.html">seeking nominations</a> for the 2015 Chancellor's Achievement Awards for Diversity and for a new award this year, a <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/caafd/wise_announcement.html">Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) award</a> that will also be presented during the CAAFD ceremony in June. This new award is the brainchild of Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE), a campus organization run by graduate students; the Chancellor's Office and ODEI are pleased to support this effort to recognize advocates who are working to get more women into science and engineering.<br/><br/>The online nomination process for both awards runs through 5 p.m. on April 1. I encourage you to submit the names of friends, colleagues, and mentors, as well as programs, campus units, and/or organizations that are making a difference.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b8fa939c8072701752fca25e847b5469"><name>campus-advisory</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus advisory </title><summary>Updates on any campus impacts of protest activities will be posted here. </summary><start-date>1425297600000</start-date><display-name>Campus advisory</display-name><path>/2015/02/campus-advisory</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/02/campus-advisory</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1424737604470</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1425662429413</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div class="callout-right narrow">

Student organizers are calling for "96 Hours of Action," culminating with a call for a student walkout on March 5. This is an advisory to be prepared and to stay informed.</p>
<p>At this time it is unknown how these activities will impact our campus; however, and as we have seen in the past, protesters may try to impede access to campus and disrupt services. Supervisors and managers should discuss contingency plans with staff ahead of Monday, March 2. Where appropriate, contingency plans may include telecommute and alternate work site arrangements. Instructors are strongly encouraged to speak with their department chair regarding contingency plans should classroom access be impacted. Additionally, employees may leave their workspace if they do not feel safe, be that because of a demonstration, building occupation, or other major incident. And of course, in any situation of imminent danger, people should call University Police at 911.</p>
<p>In addition to campus access disruptions, and as we have seen in the past, protest actions could include rallies, marches around campus and through buildings, occupations, road disruptions and marches off campus.</p>
<p>Information about actual impacts will be posted from Monday through Thursday on the campus web site. Please check the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu">campus home page</a> or go directly to <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/02/campus-advisory.html">http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/02/campus-advisory.html</a> for information about transportation, dining, and other services that could be impacted.</p>
<p>In addition to updating the web page as information warrants, the Public Affairs Office will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording information on the campus's communications hotline, 459-INFO (<a href="tel:1-831-459-4636" value="+18314594636">831-459-4636</a>).</li>
<li>Relaying information on a regular basis to KZSC Radio (88.1 FM) for broadcast.</li>
<li>Sharing information via Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/ucsc">twitter.com/ucsc</a>).</li>

The trio was honored for their article published last May,&#160; &#8220;Women&#8217;s Land Ownership and Relationship Power: A Mixed Methods Approach to Understanding Structural Inequities and Violence Against Women.&#8221; <br/><br/>The paper will be reprinted as the lead article in the journal&#8217;s March 2015 issue and is accompanied by an $1,000 honorarium. Lead author Grabe and her co-authors will receive the award at the American Psychological Association&#8217;s annual convention, scheduled for Toronto in August. <br/><br/>The article is based on data Grabe collected from 492 women in Nicaragua and Tanzania and suggests that when women in developing countries own land they gain power within their relationships and are less likely to experience violence.<br/><br/>The award is named in honor of PWQ&#8217;s founding editor, Georgia Babladelis, and began in March 2011 to mark the 35th anniversary of PWQ. The journal&#8217;s editor and associate editors choose the winning paper from the pool of all accepted papers from the previous year.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/05/06/0361684314533485</url><title>Winning paper</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bde322c68072701752fca25e8b6d85b2"><name>microbiology</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two UC Santa Cruz professors elected Fellows of the American Academy of Microbiology</title><summary>Newly elected fellows Karen Ottemann and Fitnat Yildiz are both professors of microbiology and environmental toxicology.</summary><keywords>Fitnat Yildiz, Karen Ottemann</keywords><start-date>1424880000000</start-date><display-name>Two UC Santa Cruz professors elected Fellows of the American Academy of Microbiology</display-name><path>/2015/02/microbiology</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/02/microbiology</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1424819954311</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1424907551099</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Environmental Toxicology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/yildiz-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/yildiz-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yildiz-350.jpg</name><display-name>yildiz-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>89953</file-size><width>350</width><height>438</height></image><image-alt>Fitnat Yildiz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/aam-logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/aam-logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aam-logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>aam-logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19843</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Academy of Microbiology logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Fitnat Yildiz</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/ottemann-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/ottemann-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ottemann-350.jpg</name><display-name>ottemann-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>66735</file-size><width>350</width><height>438</height></image><image-alt>Karen Ottemann</image-alt><image-caption>Karen Ottemann</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Karen Ottemann and Fitnat Yildiz, both professors of microbiology and environmental toxicology at UC Santa Cruz, have been elected Fellows of the <a href="http://academy.asm.org/">American Academy of Microbiology</a> in recognition of excellence, originality, and leadership in the microbiological sciences.</p>
<p>The newly elected fellows will be honored at a ceremony June 2 during the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Ottemann is chair of the <a href="http://www.metx.ucsc.edu/index.html">Department of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology</a> at UC Santa Cruz. Her laboratory investigates the mechanisms used by bacterial pathogens to cause inflammation and cancer. Ottemann is particularly interested in the bacterium <i>Helicobacter pylori,</i> a pathogen that infects some 3 billion humans and can lead to serious disease, including ulcers and cancer. Her lab probes how chemotaxis (movement in response to chemical cues) aids bacterial infection. She also studies the function of the atypical proteins of <i>H. pylori's</i> chemotactic signal transduction system. Recent work by the lab on the role of chemotaxis in infection has determined that this bacterial process can specifically promote inflammation by a mechanism that is currently under active study. This finding suggests that blocking chemotaxis would ameliorate disease symptoms.</p>
<p>Yildiz is a leading authority on biofilms, microbial communities that grow on surfaces and are enclosed in a protective matrix. Her lab studies molecular mechanisms of biofilm formation and their consequences in the infection cycle of the cholera pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae,</i> which causes periodic, seasonal outbreaks of disease in many parts of the world. Research in Yildiz's laboratory has identified components of the biofilm matrix and revealed their contribution to biofilm construction and stability. Her lab also identified the regulatory network that governs <i>V. cholerae</i> biofilm formation and showed how extracellular and intracellular signals are integrated into regulation of biofilm formation. Yildiz has expanded her research to identify small molecules that target biofilm formation for potential therapeutic use, and to determine the relevance of biofilm antigens as targets for the immune system and thus for potential cholera vaccines.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Microbiology is the honorific leadership group within the <a href="http://www.asm.org//">American Society for Microbiology</a>, the world's oldest and largest life science organization. The mission of the academy is to recognize scientists for outstanding contributions to microbiology and provide microbiological expertise in the service of science and the public.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cc5470858072701752fca25e41f713f3"><name>alumni-weekend-true-originals</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Distinguished alumni to speak on conservation, film, law, art, writing</title><summary>'True Originals' speaking series will feature accomplished Banana Slugs giving thought-provoking talks during Alumni Weekend 2015.</summary><keywords>M.

<p>During the Alumni Weekend celebration April 23&#8211;26, this selected group of Slugs will deliver a series of thought-provoking talks from the frontlines of their careers.</p>
<p>The newly created True Originals notable alumni speaker series will bring to the campus <b>M. Sanjayan</b> (biology Ph.D., '97), executive vice president and senior scientist for Conservation International, who has just returned from a global journey for his new five-part PBS series <i>EARTH A New Wild,</i> which debuted February 4.</p>
<p>He will give the weekend's keynote in a talk entitled, "<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2691">A New Wild: Saving Nature in a Human-Dominated World</a>," on Friday, April 24, at 7:30 p.m. at Performing Arts M110 in the campus's Media Theater. The $10 admission cost includes parking.</p>
<p><i>EARTH A New Wild </i>explores how humans are inextricably woven into every aspect of the planet's natural systems. With 45 shoots in 29 different countries, the show took Sanjayan from a preserve in India, land of the wild tiger, to the wilds of Montana, where he observed a specially trained group of cowboys who are helping ecosystems recover with their ranching practices.</p>
<p>"The area is being filled with birds, including some that are just on the edge of being put on the endangered species list," Sanjayan said in an interview.&#160; "They have wolves, elk, pronghorn&#8212;a fairly intact ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no doubt that there is massive environmental destruction being wrought upon this planet,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;But there are also amazing people doing amazing things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until recently, Sanjayan served as the lead scientist for The Nature Conservancy, where he spent 16 years specializing in development and conservation strategies, focusing on Africa, wildlife ecology, and media outreach.</p>
<p>The True Originals series continues at 11 a.m. on Saturday, April 25, with two concurrent presentations.</p>
<p><b>Ron Yerxa</b> (Grad Division '74)<b> </b>will lead a spirited discussion. The presentation, &#8220;<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2818">American Film Comedies</a>,&#8221; takes place at the Humanities Lecture Hall.</p>
<p>Yerxa is a film producer whose credits include <i>Election, Little Miss Sunshine, Cold Mountain,</i> and, recently, <i>Nebraska</i> (for which he and his partner were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture). As a producer, it's Yerxa's job to take the raw material of a manuscript, screenplay, or book, and then build it into a finished film. That basically involves hiring a writer, making the project attractive by attaching actors, and securing the financing.</p>
<p>"You have to get all seven or eight balls to fall in the hole at the same time," said Yerxa of the process.</p>
<p>Also at 11 a.m. that Saturday, <b>Paul Hall</b> (Merrill '72) will moderate an interdisciplinary panel of distinguished alumni who will take a close look at the interplay of money and power in political and governing systems; from campaign finance and the effect of money in politics to legal and political responses to global warming and climate change. The presentation, "<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2820">Money, Politics, Climate Change and the Law: Will We Rise to the Challenge</a>?" takes place at the Stevenson Fireside Lounge at Stevenson College.</p>
<p>Panelists include: Mary Doyle (Porter, '74), former vice president, legal and global chief compliance and ethics officer at Oracle; Judge Kelvin Filer (Stevenson &#8217;77), Los Angeles Superior Court in Compton; Judge Allan J. Goodman (Stevenson &#8217;67), Los Angeles Superior Court; Judge Teri Jackson (Stevenson &#8217;77), San Francisco Superior Court; Art Torres (Stevenson &#8217;68), retired state senator and vice chair of CIRM; and Zach Wasserman (Merrill &#8217;69), public interest lawyer in Oakland.</p>
<p>The True Originals series continues Saturday afternoon with two more concurrent talks.</p>
<p>Alumni arts professionals present how an array of educational experiences at UC Santa Cruz helped inspire five of its graduates to pursue their present careers at five of America&#8217;s notable art museums in "<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2693">From Here to Modernity&#8212;Perspectives from Distinguished Museum Professionals</a>," which is 2:30&#8211;4 p.m. in DARC Room 230.</p>
<p>A panel hosted and introduced by Shelby Graham, director of the Porter Sesnon Gallery, will be moderated by <b>Jock Reynolds</b> (Stevenson &#8217;69), director of the Yale University Art Gallery, holding forth with alumni colleagues <b>Jeremy Strick</b> (Cowell &#8217;77), director, Nasher Sculpture Center; <b>Philip Brookman</b> (Porter &#8217;75), consulting curator, National Gallery of Art; <b>Karen Moss</b> (Porter &#8217;77), curator and faculty, Otis College of Art and Design and USC Curatorial MA Program; and <b>Erin O&#8217;Toole</b> (Kresge &#8217;92), associate curator of photography, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.</p>

<p>This was part of their welcome for Anita Hill, the focus of the highest-profile sexual harassment case in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Her Thursday night talk at UC Santa Cruz, "Speaking Truth to Power: Gender &amp; Racial Equality 1991&#8211;2015," had students and community members lined up for blocks more than an hour before she took the podium. An audience of 450 filled the College Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room, while another 300 people watched a live feed in the Humanities Lecture Hall.</p>
<p>When Hill appeared before a television audience of 22 million in 1991, accusing a U.S. Supreme Court Justice nominee of inappropriate sexual behavior, her life changed overnight. Her testimony took place in front of an all-white, all-male Senate subcommittee during Thomas's confirmation hearings. Her statements set off a nationwide discussion involving sexual harassment on the job, race, and gender representation, but did not stop his confirmation.</p>
<p>During her lecture Hill said that the United States, nearly a quarter-century after the hearings, still has a ways to go when it comes to protecting the rights of sexual harassment victims.</p>
<p>But she added that greater awareness as well as ongoing "private conversations" about sexual harassment issues and gender equality put this generation in a greater position of strength. Two decades ago, "there were many women who didn't even know sexual harassment was against the law &#8230; Sexual harassment was just life, something you just had to put up with &#8230; Boys will be boys, and, apparently, men will be boys, too."</p>
<p>This increased awareness shows how the case continues to reverberate in the United States, she said.</p>
<p>Looking back to 1991, she pointed to newspaper columnists who complained of a lurid "sideshow'' after Hill testified that Clarence Thomas "routinely discussed sex, routinely pressured me and other women for dates and discussed pornography in the workplace."</p>
<p>But she said that so-called "public spectacle" raised the question, "How would it feel if we could go to work and not be taunted and assaulted? We are here today asking questions not only about what happened in 1991 but what happens in the lives of people every day."</p>
<p>During her talk she dissected the case as well as its aftermath, including a poll that revealed most Americans took Thomas's side over Hill's. Hill said that the pivotal moment was Thomas's statement that he was the victim of a "high-tech lynching."</p>
<p>"There are people who have studied lynching and people who have experienced it through their family history," Hill said. "There is no evidence of a lynching of an African-American taking place because he abused a black woman. That was a complete misappropriation of history."</p>
<p>After an audience member asked what words of advice she would give to victims feeling some trepidation about seeking justice, she gave an answer that combined solidarity and hope with a call for greater action.</p>
<p>"I would just say I hope my life is a living example of the power of coming forward," said Hill, now a Brandeis University professor of social policy, an activist, the author of two books, and the subject of a new high-profile documentary by an Academy Award-winning director.</p>
<p>She is not, in other words, a person who let a period of controversy waylay her for very long. But she added an important caveat to her statement. "You can speak the truth,'' she said. "You can step up and survive." But she stopped short of saying "come forward, you will feel better'' in every case because "we cannot promise that every girl who is harassed or assaulted" will be protected and receive a fair adjudication of her case.</p>
<p>"We have to do our job as well," Hill said. "We have to earn their confidence through our behavior. We cannot promise them everything, but we can promise them a system that works."</p>
<p>The U.S. is not quite there yet, Hill said, "but I am firm believer" that this time is coming soon. "And I'm telling you, if I can be optimistic, I think many people can be optimistic."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz distinguished professor Bettina Aptheker, UC Presidential Co-Chair of Feminist Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies, was on hand to select questions from the audience; Hill was on campus at Aptheker's invitation.</p>
<p>The talk, a UC Santa Cruz 50th anniversary event, was sponsored by the UC Presidential Chair in Feminist Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies, the Dean of Students, the Humanities Division, the Social Sciences Division, the Arts Division, the Institute for Humanities Research, and Bookshop Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cdc10ef88072701752fca25edb1a93df"><name>Hult-competition</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz students compete in global challenge for $1 million Hult Prize</title><summary>A team of UC Santa Cruz students has advanced to the regional finals of the sixth annual Hult Prize, the world’s largest student competition and start-up platform for social good. </summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, hult prize, clinton global initiative, social justice, early childhood education</keywords><start-date>1425087600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz students compete for $1 million Hult Prize</display-name><path>/2015/02/Hult-competition</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/02/Hult-competition</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1425086156497</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1426011862359</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Music</value><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/Hult-team-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/Hult-team-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Hult-team-375.jpg</name><display-name>Hult-team-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>132747</file-size><width>375</width><height>269</height></image><image-alt>UCSC students Kymberley Kudravy, Justin Kohlberg, Terre Lee</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/02/images/Hult-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/02/images/Hult-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Hult-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>Hult-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>29954</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UCSC students Kymberley Kudravy, Justin Kohlberg, Terre Lee</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>From left to right: Kymberley Kudravy, Justin Kohlberg, Terre Lee</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Three seniors participating in world’s largest student competition, competing for start-up funding to solve President Clinton’s Early Childhood Challenge</article-subhead><article-text><p>A team of UC Santa Cruz students has advanced to the regional finals of the sixth annual Hult Prize, the world&#8217;s largest student competition and start-up platform for social good.</p>
<p>Each year the Hult Prize, in partnership with President Bill Clinton and the Clinton Global Initiative, challenges students around the world to develop innovative social enterprises that aim to tackle pressing issues faced by billions of people.</p>
<p>The winners receive $1 million in seed capital, as well as mentorship and advice from the international business community to launch their newly formed company.</p>
<p>Regional rounds of competition are held each spring in Boston, San Francisco, London, Dubai, Shanghai and Sao Paulo, with a final round and awards ceremony held at the Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting each fall.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz team was one of 250 selected from more than 20,000 applications--from over 500 colleges and universities in over 150 countries--to participate in the regional finals. It consists of Terre Lee (double major in music and environmental studies), Kymberley Kudravy (double major in music and business management economics), and Justin Kohlberg (double major in music and film and digital media).</p>
<p>Each team will present their case at the regionals for how they would provide sustainable, high-quality early education solutions to 10 million children under the age of six in urban slums.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UCSC team proposes to bring quality enrichment to early childhood education through interactive learning tools inspired by the music program, El Sistema,&#8221; said Lee, the team leader. &#8220;El Sistema challenges the notion that socioeconomics is the biggest predictor of academic success.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a social justice-through-music education program,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Engaging children in music from a very early age breaks down barriers, from socioeconomic to language, and to special needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee has been teaching violin after school at Gault Elementary in Santa Cruz for the past three years, as part of an El Sistema program for children who can&#8217;t afford music education.</p>
<p>&#8220;Terre, Kymberley and Justin represent the best of UCSC students both in the classroom and in our community,&#8221; notes UC Santa Cruz economics professor David Kaun. &#8220;Their work with Gault School&#8217;s El Sistema program is bringing music to young students, enriching their lives in ways that would not have happened otherwise. The Hult Prize will enable their efforts to expand many times over throughout the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Hult competition is designed to give student entrepreneurs from around the world a platform to innovate and revolutionize the way society thinks about servicing the poor. The prize money is seeded into the newly created company, which will be run by the student team that came up with the idea.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz team will compete in the San Francisco regionals on March 13-14.</p>
<p>Regional winners will then pitch their start-up at the Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting, where the winner will receive $1 million.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a2648c828072704638f4f2225e2084c5"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1325408400000</start-date><path>/2015/02/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/02/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1420063706213</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1420063706213</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
