This is especially true for courses that large numbers of students are required to take for their majors, such as calculus.</p>
<p>The online calculus courses taught by UC Santa Cruz math faculty Frank B&#228;uerle and Anthony Tromba ("Calculus for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics," Math 19A &amp; 19B) are now available to all UC students through the <a href="http://crossenroll.universityofcalifornia.edu/">UC Online</a> cross-campus enrollment system. They are the first such courses to have "articulation agreements" with all nine UC undergraduate campuses ensuring that they count as prerequisites and for general education requirements.</p>
<p>Herbie Lee, vice provost for academic affairs, said he recently met two UCSC students who told him they were waiting to take calculus online because they had heard it was better than the traditional course. "It's a great course. Their concept from the beginning was to create a great calculus course and do it online," Lee said. "It's actually more interactive, with more active learning by the students, than when they're sitting in a lecture hall."</p>
<p>Tromba, a professor of mathematics, said the course's online discussion forums are especially good for students who are insecure about asking questions in class. Students at UC Santa Cruz also have access to in-person discussion sections, but any student can post questions anonymously online and get responses from faculty and teaching assistants. Other students often respond to questions as well, with instructors providing guidance and amplification.</p>
<p>"I have never seen such a degree of interaction between TAs, faculty, and students," Tromba said. "It's a historic transformation."</p>
<p><strong>Instructional designers</strong></p>
<p>The online lectures also offer advantages for many students because they can stop and replay any parts of the presentation they didn't understand. In developing their calculus course, Tromba and B&#228;uerle worked with Katrina Fullman, an instructional designer at the UC Office of the President (UCOP), to create the online lectures and interactive course materials. UC Santa Cruz now has an instructional designer on staff, Aaron Zachmeier, who will be working with Tromba and B&#228;uerle on a new "Vector Calculus" course.</p>
<p>Zachmeier has also been working with several other UCSC faculty to develop new online courses. "Geology of the National Parks," for example, was developed by Susan Schwartz at UC Santa Cruz, Jeffrey Gee at UC San Diego, and David Osleger at UC Davis. This spring, they taught the online class separately to students on their respective campuses. Next year, it will be open to all UC students through UC Online and taught each quarter by one of the faculty collaborators. Schwartz, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences, will teach it winter quarter.</p>
<p>According to Schwartz, funding from the UCOP <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/innovative-learning-technology-initiative/">Innovative Learning Technology Initiative</a> was crucial, because developing a good online course takes a lot of time and effort. She was able to hire a graduate student, Erin Todd, to work on the course with her, and instructional designers at Davis and Santa Cruz worked with the instructors to take full advantage of online technology. "I saw it as a chance to put together a really good class and see what happens," Schwartz said.</p>
<p>The instructors traveled to Crater Lake, Lassen, Yosemite, and other national parks to record lectures in the field. They also incorporated animations of geological processes, Google Earth images, and other visual elements into the lectures. "We would use those in a traditional class too, but in the online lectures you can seamlessly integrate a lot of animations and video clips," Schwartz said. "The nice thing is it's professionally edited, but it would be hard for faculty to do this without support. I believe in online education, but not if you just film a lecture in a classroom and put it online."</p>
<p>Like Tromba, Schwartz said she felt she was able to have good interactions with students online. But she found that relatively few students were taking advantage of the online office hours. "We may have to make it required at least once so they see how it works, because the students who did engage online really liked it," she said.</p>
<p>Other online courses currently being developed at UC Santa Cruz include "Ecosystems of California" taught by Erika Zavaleta, professor of environmental studies; and a new online Writing 2 course taught by writing program lecturer Len&#233; Whitley-Putz.</p>
<p>According to Associate Vice Provost Lee, the UCOP program provides grants of $50,000 to $100,000 to support online course development, and UCSC faculty have had good success getting those grants. "Online courses are expensive to produce, so it's not a way to save money," he said. "It's about improving the quality of the educational experience. This is a good opportunity for faculty who are interested."</p>
<p>When it's done right, Lee said, the benefits of online courses include a more interactive learning experience; the ability to integrate more types of material into courses; and the flexibility of the online format to suit different styles of learning. The online format can be especially helpful for students with learning disabilities, said Rick Gubash, director of the UCSC <a href="http://drc.ucsc.edu/">Disability Resource Center</a>. "Any time students can replay information to capture something they missed can be really useful," he said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Universal accessibility</strong></p>
<p>Gubash said designing online courses to be universally accessible can be helpful for all students. Captioning of lectures, for example, not only makes the content accessible to deaf students, it also helps students who find visual information easier to process than speech. "I'm excited about the opportunity to take accessibility into account from the beginning in designing online courses," Gubash said. "It will be better for all learners, and can eliminate the need for accommodations after the course is designed."</p>
<p>Not all online courses involve prerecorded lectures. The first UCSC course offered through UC Online to all UC students was a course on water policy taught by Brent Haddad, professor of environmental studies and technology management. Haddad delivers his lectures live online via webcam, which allows him to answer questions and interact with students during the lectures. Each lecture is recorded and posted online, however, so students are still able to review any material they might have missed, and Haddad also posts pre-recorded supplementary material.</p>
<p>According to Haddad, remote access to online courses is a big advantage, even with live lectures. "I've had students from Korea, Russia, the East Coast, and throughout California take the class, and some of them provide really interesting perspectives," he said. "It's also straightforward for me to integrate guest speakers who aren't in Santa Cruz, and I do that frequently, from as far away as Washington, D.C."</p>
<p>Tromba said his online calculus course has had students enrolled from across the UC system, as well as from China, Canada, and one from a boat in the Mediterranean. Of course, the interactions faculty have with students online are different from when they meet with students in person. Schwartz said she would not want to go online with the small, upper-division courses she teaches. For big classes, however, in which it's hard to engage with individual students in the lecture hall, the online format offers real advantages.</p>
<p>"Some say they would still rather have a teacher in a classroom," Tromba said. "But it's a question of what you're comparing the online course to--a class in a very large lecture hall where students can't either read what the professor writes on the blackboard or clearly hear what he or she is saying? In the online environment, the visuals and audio are crystal clear. For every hour of lecture, we spend more than ten hours of preparation."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://crossenroll.universityofcalifornia.edu/</url><title>UC Cross-campus Enrollment</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.ucop.edu/innovative-learning-technology-initiative/</url><title>UC Innovative Learning Technology Initiative</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4a9ddaa0807270173c4b67b13a202cc6"><name>sutter-scholarship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz grad River Charles earns Sutter scholarship for medical school</title><summary>River Charles will receive the Primary Care Physician Award from Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center and the Central California Alliance for Health.</summary><keywords>Primary Care Physician Award, Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center, Central California Alliance for Health.</keywords><start-date>1436166000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz grad River Charles earns Sutter scholarship for medical school</display-name><path>/2015/07/sutter-scholarship</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/07/sutter-scholarship</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1435770935945</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1438360905602</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Mark Riley, SMSC</name><title></title><phone/><email>rileym1@sutterhealth.org</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/07/images/river-charles-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/07/images/river-charles-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>river-charles-350.jpg</name><display-name>river-charles-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>98583</file-size><width>350</width><height>398</height></image><image-alt>River Charles</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/07/images/river-charles-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/07/images/river-charles-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>river-charles-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>river-charles-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24347</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>River Charles</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>River Charles</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>River Charles will receive the ninth annual Primary Care Physician Award from Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center (SMSC) and the Central California Alliance for Health.</p>
<p>"River has an outstanding academic background and his volunteer efforts have given him insight into the health needs of the community," said Stephen Gray, SMSC chief administrative officer. "We look forward to River applying those skills and insights to his career as a doctor."</p>
<p>Charles (Cowell '15, biochemistry and molecular biology)&#160;will be attending the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis. He graduated from UC Santa Cruz with highest honors and cum laude in biochemistry and molecular biology, was on the dean's honor list seven times, and is a recipient of the Doug Drexler Chemistry Scholarship. He served as president of the UCSC Chemistry Club and volunteered with the Santa Cruz AIDS Project and Diabetes Research Center in Tustin, California. Charles' interest in a medical career was inspired by a medical emergency with his mother when he was young and encouragement from his grandfather, who is a scientist and primary care physician.</p>
<p>The $10,000 annual award was established by SMSC and the Alliance in conjunction with the UC Santa Cruz Foundation to help carry out a mission to provide high-quality primary care to Central Coast Medi-Cal patients. The award supports a graduating UCSC senior who will be entering an accredited medical school, and the recipient must intend to return to the Central Coast to practice in primary care.</p>
<p>Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center is part of the Sutter Health network.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4b93ea2b807270173c4b67b14d207c24"><name>in-memoriam-andrew-shan</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Andrew Shan</title><summary>We regret to tell you that Andrew Shan, a first year student at the University and a member of Kresge College, died Wednesday, June 24, 2015. </summary><start-date>1435734000000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: Andrew Shan</display-name><path>/2015/07/in-memoriam-andrew-shan</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/07/in-memoriam-andrew-shan</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1435787061363</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1435787061363</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif" style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;">We regret to tell you that Andrew Shan, a first year student at the University and a member of Kresge College, died Wednesday, June 24, 2015.&#160; Andrew was studying Economics.<br/>

Now well into its second month, the bloom extends all along the coast from Santa Barbara to Alaska. In Alaska, the algal toxin domoic acid has reached levels never before seen that far north, according to Raphael Kudela, professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"It truly is an unprecedented event," said Kudela, who holds the Ida Benson Lynn Chair in Ocean Health at UC Santa Cruz. "It's doing very strange things along the whole West Coast of the United States."</p>
<p>The bloom involves the proliferation of <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> diatoms, a type of microscopic algae, which produce a neurotoxin called domoic acid. This has forced the closure of shellfish harvesting and other fisheries along the West Coast to prevent humans from being exposed to the toxin, which causes amnesic shellfish poisoning. The toxin is also affecting wildlife, including sea lions and fish-eating birds such as pelicans.</p>
<p>The videos above are from an interview with Kudela conducted on June 19, 2015, in his lab at UC Santa Cruz. Kudela explains the conditions that have made the current bloom so extensive and long lasting; what its impacts are on people and wildlife; and what his research team is doing to study it and to predict future harmful algal blooms.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://youtu.be/vgG1vm2bx0M</url><title>Raphael Kudela interview, part 1</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://youtu.be/VM6K4ZoA14Q</url><title>Raphael Kudela interview, part 2</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.cencoos.org/data/models/habs</url><title>Harmful Algal Bloom conditions (CenCOOS)</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/algal-bloom.html</url><title>Large bloom of toxic algae under way in Monterey Bay and beyond</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4f7a6c4c807270173c4b67b1f419f2f4"><name>fall2015-admissions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In 50th year, campus will enroll class with exceptional academic credentials</title><summary>With the largest applicant pool in the history of the campus, and a smaller freshman class than the previous year, UC Santa Cruz increased its admission selectivity. </summary><start-date>1435852800000</start-date><display-name>Fall 2015 admissions</display-name><path>/2015/07/fall2015-admissions</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/07/fall2015-admissions</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1435852499944</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1436200855193</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/07/images/fall2015-admissions-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/07/images/fall2015-admissions-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fall2015-admissions-400px.jpg</name><display-name>fall2015-admissions-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>230855</file-size><width>399</width><height>280</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/07/images/fall2015-admissions-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/07/images/fall2015-admissions-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fall2015-admissions-80px.jpg</name><display-name>fall2015-admissions-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>24350</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span id="docs-internal-guid-571334d6-4f64-09bd-3284-670e2a929288"><span>UC Santa Cruz offered admission to 23,284 students for its fall 2015 freshmen class, with more than 75 percent of offers going to California residents.

<p>With the largest applicant pool in the history of the campus, and a smaller freshman class than the previous year, the campus increased its admission selectivity, with the average high school GPA increasing from 3.6 to 3.75 and the average SAT total score rising from 1680 to 1750.</p>
<p>The vast majority of students - about 3,000 - will be from California, with the rest coming from other states or other countries.</p>
<p>"We continue to primarily educate California's students," said Michael K. McCawley, UCSC's director of admissions, "but today's student needs to prepare to succeed in a global society. To that end, having geographic diversity from within our state, from other states and other countries, enhances their educational experience."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz offered admission to 23,284 students for its fall 2015 freshmen class, according to <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-admits-more-113000-students-fall-2015">data released today</a> (July 2) by University of California's Office of the President. The largest portion - 17,588 or just over 75 percent - are students coming from California. Total freshman admission offers remained nearly the same, with 128 more students offered a seat than a year ago - a reflection of smaller enrollment targets for fall 2015.</p>
<p>The campus also offered admission to 4,342 students from a California Community College, an increase of 119 students (4.1 percent) from last year.</p>
<p>"Our increased efforts with students from California community colleges show positive results," said McCawley. "Ensuring that well-prepared transfer students can complete their studies and earn a UCSC degree within two years is a priority for our campus and the UC system as a whole."</p>
<p>Faculty and staff are in the midst of preparing to welcome the new class into the campus's distinctive residential colleges, first-year Honors Program, Challenge Program, and into ever-expanding opportunities for undergraduate research, internships, and creative projects with world-class faculty.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="../01/applications-release.xml">record applications</a> - nearly 55,000 students - the campus must enroll roughly 500 to 700 fewer students than a year ago, due to a large incoming class in fall 2014.</p>
<p>A smaller incoming freshman class will also mean fewer students from underrepresented groups than enrolled a year ago. The number of African American students admitted declined year-over-year by 180, from 700 to 520. Additionally, the number of Chicano/Latino students declined by 793, from 5,235 to 4,442.</p>
<p>"We've seen strong growth in the numbers of African American and Chicano/Latino students admitted in the last several years," McCawley said. "We want to make sure this decrease is an anomaly. We are going to work even harder to engage our students, alumni and faculty to make sure they're helping recruit and enroll students from underrepresented ethnicities."</p>
<p>Out-of-state and international students bring a diversity of perspectives to classrooms discussions and to the social and cultural atmosphere on campus. The campus offered admission to 2,500 out-of-state students and 3,196 international students.</p>
<p>"While the admission rate of out-of-state and international students is high, the number of these students that accept an offer of admission and eventually enroll is much lower than California students," McCawley explained.</p>
<p>The fall 2015 admitted class of California residents continues to be diverse with 34.6 percent Asian American, 32.2 percent white/other, 25.3 percent Hispanic/Latino, 3 percent African American, 0.9 percent American Indian, and 0.4 percent Pacific Islander. An additional 3.8 percent of admitted students did not report their race/ethnicity.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="50d5ee8e807270173c4b67b1930c6542"><name>optogenetics</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ion channel mechanics yield insights into optogenetics experiments</title><summary>UCSC researchers have determined the molecular mechanism of proteins that make nerve cells respond to light.</summary><keywords>David Kliger, fast laser spectroscopy, optogenetics, channelrhodopsin</keywords><start-date>1436166000000</start-date><display-name>Ion channel mechanics yield insights into optogenetics experiments</display-name><path>/2015/07/optogenetics</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/07/optogenetics</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1435875274329</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1436456475488</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/07/images/optogenetics-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/07/images/optogenetics-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>optogenetics-250.jpg</name><display-name>optogenetics-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>48168</file-size><width>250</width><height>138</height></image><image-alt>optogenetics illustration</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/07/images/optogenetics-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/07/images/optogenetics-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>optogenetics-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>optogenetics-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19783</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>optogenetics illustration</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/07/images/kliger-lab.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/07/images/kliger-lab.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kliger-lab.jpg</name><display-name>kliger-lab.jpg</display-name><file-size>13150</file-size><width>250</width><height>210</height></image><image-alt>David Kliger</image-alt><image-caption><p>David Kliger's lab uses fast laser spectroscopy to study biologically important molecules such as channelrhodopsin, an ion channel widely used in optogenetics experiments.</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Optogenetics techniques, which allow scientists to map and control nerve cells using light stimulation, are being used to study neural circuits in the brain with unprecedented precision. This revolutionary technology relies on light-sensitive proteins such as channelrhodopsins, and researchers at UC Santa Cruz have now determined the molecular mechanism involved in the light-induced activation of one of these proteins.</p>
<p>The new findings, published July 3 in two papers in the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em>, can help scientists create tailor-made proteins optimized for use in optogenetics, said David Kliger, senior author of both papers and a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Little was known about the functional mechanism of these proteins even though they are widely used in optogenetics," Kliger said.</p>
<p>The researchers used fast laser spectroscopy to study the function of Channelrhodopsin-2, which is found in a type of marine algae and is widely used in optogenetics experiments. Channelrhodopsins are ion channels that control the flow of ions across cell membranes. There are many kinds of ion channels that serve different purposes in different types of cells. Nerve signals involve ion flow across the membranes of nerve cells, and the breakthrough of optogenetics was the discovery that inserting the genes for light-gated ion channels such as channelrhodopsin into neurons would make them fire in response to light.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2015/05/13/jbc.M114.631614.long">first paper</a> describes the mechanism of channelrhodopsin function in terms of intermediate states the protein goes through in the process of opening the ion channel. In the <a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2015/05/13/jbc.M115.653071.long">second paper</a>, the researchers showed that the mechanism revealed in the first paper can explain patterns of ion currents observed in optogenetics experiments.</p>
<p>"It is exciting because this opens up a methodology to start selecting mutant proteins with properties optimized for optogenetics, which is important for brain research and for studying neurological processes in general," Kliger said.</p>
<p>There are several types of modifications that could be useful for optogenetics, such as making the proteins more efficient so that less light is needed to trigger currents in neurons, he said. In some cases, researchers might want to speed up the channel opening or slow it down, or they might want to speed up or slow down the channel closing. Depending on the tissues being studied, they might also want to shift the spectrum of light needed to activate the protein.</p>
<p>"These basic biophysics experiments can help in optimizing how the proteins function in optogenetics experiments," Kliger said.</p>

The results, published July 10 in <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/1/6/e1500093.full.pdf"><em>Science Advances</em></a>, provide important data for researchers trying to predict the fate of the ice sheet, which has experienced rapid melting over the past decade.</p>
<p>Lead author Andrew Fisher, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, emphasized that the geothermal heating reported in this study does not explain the alarming loss of ice from West Antarctica that has been documented by other researchers. "The ice sheet developed and evolved with the geothermal heat flux coming up from below--it's part of the system. But this could help explain why the ice sheet is so unstable. When you add the effects of global warming, things can start to change quickly," he said. &#160;</p>
<p>High heat flow below the West Antarctic ice sheet may also help explain the presence of lakes beneath it and why parts of the ice sheet flow rapidly as ice streams. Water at the base of the ice streams is thought to provide the lubrication that speeds their motion, carrying large volumes of ice out onto the floating ice shelves at the edges of the ice sheet. Fisher noted that the geothermal measurement was from only one location, and heat flux is likely to vary from place to place beneath the ice sheet.</p>
<p>"This is the first geothermal heat flux measurement made below the West Antarctic ice sheet, so we don't know how localized these warm geothermal conditions might be. This is a region where there is volcanic activity, so this measurement may be due to a local heat source in the crust," Fisher said.</p>
<p><strong>WISSARD Project</strong></p>
<p>The study was part of a large Antarctic drilling project funded by the National Science Foundation called WISSARD (Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling), for which UC Santa Cruz is one of three lead institutions. The research team used a special thermal probe, designed and built at UC Santa Cruz, to measure temperatures in sediments below Subglacial Lake Whillans, which lies beneath half a mile of ice. After boring through the ice sheet with a special hot-water drill, researchers lowered the probe through the borehole until it buried itself in the sediments below the subglacial lake. The probe measured temperatures at different depths in the sediments, revealing a rate of change in temperature with depth about five times higher than that typically found on continents. The results indicate a relatively rapid flow of heat towards the bottom of the ice sheet.</p>
<p>This geothermal heating contributes to melting of basal ice, which supplies water to a network of subglacial lakes and wetlands that scientists have discovered underlies a large region of the ice sheet. In a separate study published last year in <em>Nature</em>, the WISSARD microbiology team reported an abundant and diverse microbial ecosystem in the same lake. Warm geothermal conditions may help to make subglacial habitats more supportive of microbial life, and could also drive fluid flow that delivers heat, carbon, and nutrients to these communities.</p>
<p>According to coauthor Slawek Tulaczyk, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz and one of the WISSARD project leaders, the geothermal heat flux is an important value for the computer models scientists are using to understand why and how quickly the West Antarctic ice sheet is shrinking.</p>
<p>"It is important that we get this number right if we are going to make accurate predictions of how the West Antarctic ice sheet will behave in the future, how much it is melting, how quickly ice streams flow, and what the impact might be on sea level rise," Tulaczyk said. "I waited for many years to see a directly measured value of geothermal flux from beneath this ice sheet."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Melting ice shelves</strong></p>
<p>Antarctica's huge ice sheets are fed by snow falling in the interior of the continent. The ice gradually flows out toward the edges. The West Antarctic ice sheet is considered less stable than the larger East Antarctic ice sheet because much of it rests on land that is below sea level, and the ice shelves at its outer edges are floating on the sea. Recent studies by other research teams have found that the ice shelves are melting due to warm ocean currents now circulating under the ice, and the rate at which the ice shelves are shrinking is accelerating. These findings have heightened concerns about the overall stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet.</p>
<p>The geothermal heat flux measured in the new study was about 285 milliwatts per square meter, which is like the heat from one small LED Christmas-tree light per square meter, Fisher said. The researchers also measured the upward heat flux through the ice sheet (about 105 milliwatts per square meter) using an instrument developed by coauthor Scott Tyler at the University of Nevada, Reno. That instrument was left behind in the WISSARD borehole as it refroze, and the measurements, based on laser light scattering in a fiber-optic cable, were taken a year later. Combining the measurements both below and within the ice enabled calculation of the rate at which melt water is produced at the base of the ice sheet at the drill site, yielding a rate of about half an inch per year.</p>
<p>In addition to Fisher, Tulaczyk, and Tyler, the coauthors of the paper include Ken Mankoff, who earned his Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz and is now at Pennsylvania State University, and current UCSC graduate student Neil Foley. This research was funded by the National Science Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/wissard-update.html</url><title>Scientists drill through half mile of Antarctic ice for data on ice sheet stability</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/01/wissard-success.html</url><title>Scientists collect first intact samples from an Antarctic subglacial lake</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6e3cb0da807270173c4b67b12078e701"><name>pediatric-cancer</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz pediatric cancer project receives $250,000 to fight high-risk neuroblastoma</title><summary>Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation has awarded the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute a $250,000 grant for pediatric cancer research.</summary><keywords>Genomics Institute, pediatric cancer, neuroblastoma, David Haussler, Olena Morozova</keywords><start-date>1436338800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz pediatric cancer project receives $250,000 to fight high-risk neuroblastoma</display-name><path>/2015/07/pediatric-cancer</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/07/pediatric-cancer</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1436368547834</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1436368884842</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Kayla Bernard and Branwyn Wagman</name><title></title><phone/><email>bwagman@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/07/images/alsf-logo.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2015/07/images/alsf-logo.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>alsf-logo.jpeg</name><display-name>alsf-logo.jpeg</display-name><file-size>20133</file-size><width>234</width><height>215</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/07/images/alsf-logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/07/images/alsf-logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alsf-logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>alsf-logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>34349</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/07/images/olena-morozova-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/07/images/olena-morozova-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>olena-morozova-300.jpg</name><display-name>olena-morozova-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>64520</file-size><width>300</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Olena Morozova</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation advances groundbreaking research to identify new treatment options</article-subhead><article-text><p>Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation (ALSF) has awarded the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">Genomics Institute</a> an innovation grant of $250,000 over two years to advance research on two groundbreaking approaches for identifying treatment options for children with neuroblastoma.</p>
<p>"Neuroblastoma is one of the most enigmatic pediatric cancers," said postdoctoral scholar Olena Morozova, project lead for the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Project at the Genomics Institute. "Despite extensive studies of patients' tumor DNA conducted by the NCI's TARGET initiative and others, we still lack treatment targets for the majority of high-risk neuroblastoma patients."</p>
<p>One approach the project is pursuing explores whether data collected from neuroblastoma patients can be harnessed to identify therapies that will use the patient&#8217;s own immune system to fight the cancer. David Haussler, scientific director of the Genomics Institute, explained that such approaches have led to lasting remissions in cases of metastatic melanoma and other adult cancers, but so far have had limited application in children.</p>
<p>"The low toxicity of an immunogenomic approach makes it ideal for children, if it can be made to work," Haussler said. "We are doing an intensive study of how cancer cells reveal to the immune system that they are different from normal cells. If we can identify specific molecules that make cancer cells distinguishable, then new immunotherapy methods used in adult cancers might be used to train a child's immune system to recognize and eliminate the cancer."</p>
<p>A second approach involves analyzing tumor genomes and their mutation pathways to identify instances where a child's cancer is genomically similar to a treatable adult cancer.</p>
<p>"Through this approach, we may find instances where treatments developed for adult cancers can be used in children," Morozova said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Cancer Genomics Hub</strong></p>
<p>This method employs a pan-cancer analysis comparing an individual child's neuroblastoma tumor genome with other pediatric and adult tumor genomes of all types. Morozova uses genome data from tens of thousands of tumors collected in the UC Santa Cruz Cancer Genomics Hub, the largest collection of cancer genomes in the world for general research use.</p>
<p>Discovering genomic profiles and genetic pathway changes that are similar between adult tumors and neuroblastoma samples can suggest candidate drugs for treating individual neuroblastoma tumors.</p>
<p>"For example, if a child's neuroblastoma tumor is predicted to depend on the same genetic pathway change as certain adult breast cancers, targeted therapies against this pathway in breast cancers could potentially be repositioned for use against that child's cancer," Morozova explained.</p>
<p>This project has the benefit of a close connection with a leading pediatric oncologist, John Maris at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. "Dr. Maris is an expert in early-phase clinical trials for high-risk neuroblastoma patients. He is partnering with us to test the applicability of personalized immunotherapy approaches in this disease," Morozova said.</p>
<p>Maris and his colleagues have assembled the world's largest collection of neuroblastoma cases, and this project will be able to use that data to test UC Santa Cruz's bioinformatic predictions.</p>
<p>ALSF Innovation Grants are designed as seed funding for researchers with cutting-edge approaches to pediatric cancer research. ALSF carefully selects innovative projects having the most substantive and critical contributions to the field of childhood cancer research and that are likely to play a part in bringing the latest, most promising life-saving treatments to seriously ill children.</p>
<p><strong>About ALSF</strong></p>
<p>Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation emerged from the front-yard lemonade stand of cancer patient Alexandra "Alex" Scott (1996-2004). In 2000, 4-year-old Alex announced that she wanted to hold a lemonade stand to raise money to help find a cure for all children with cancer. Since Alex held that first stand, the foundation bearing her name has evolved into a national fundraising movement, complete with thousands of supporters across the country carrying on her legacy of hope. To date, ALSF, a registered 501(c)3 charity, has raised more than $100 million toward fulfilling Alex's dream of finding a cure, funding over 500 pediatric cancer research projects nationally.</p>
<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz Inspiration</strong></p>
<p>Much like ALSF, the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Project was inspired by another little girl's battle with cancer. In 2012, the daughter of a staff member at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, Aurora, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma. Morozova, Haussler, and the team at the Genomics Institute decided to create the Treehouse Project to apply their expertise in genomics and bioinformatics in the quest to find new treatments for childhood cancers. To honor the successful treatment of Aurora's cancer, the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute hosted an Alex's Lemonade Stand event that raised over $12,000 for ALSF, becoming one of its top fundraisers in 2014.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to receive this grant from ALSF as one of the first sources of support for our newly established pediatric cancer efforts," Morozova said. "This grant will allow us to investigate novel forms of therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma. We hope to expand our efforts to other childhood cancers very soon."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6fb84611807270173c4b67b12f1e3c3a"><name>lin-bruce-medal</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Douglas N.C.

Lin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, will receive the 2015 Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal. The highest honor bestowed by the ASP, the award recognizes Lin for a lifetime of outstanding research in astronomy.</p>
<p>Lin is known for his significant and seminal achievements in a variety of domains, including the orbital motion of the Magellanic Clouds, the formation and evolution of exoplanets, the physics of cataclysmic variables and accretion disks, and the dynamics, structure, and evolution of Saturn's Rings.</p>
<p>Awarded since 1898, the Bruce Medal has gone to some of the greatest astronomers of the past century, including five previous recipients at UC Santa Cruz: George Herbig, Albert Whitford, Donald Osterbrook, Robert Kraft, and Sandra Faber.</p>
<p>Lin has made major contributions to scientific understanding of the dynamics of the Magellanic Clouds within our galaxy's dark halo, a campaign that he was the driving force on for decades. His writing on the subject remains a classic reference, and his study of dark matter in dwarf spheroidal galaxies started a new subfield.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Exoplanets</strong></p>
<p>Lin is also recognized as a leading expert on the architecture of extrasolar planetary systems--where planets form, how they interact with their parent proto-solar disk of gas, and how far from their parent star they end up. He has investigated the evolution of planetary systems and is responsible for the models that help astronomers interpret the findings from exoplanet studies. Shortly after the discovery of a "hot Jupiter" in 51 Pegasus, Lin wrote the seminal paper on how these objects could have obtained such close proximity to their host star.</p>
<p>In addition to being a driving theoretical force in several fields, Lin is also the founding director of the Kavli Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Peking University, where he has a major impact on the scientific advancement of China. Lin was nominated for the Bruce Medal by the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The nomination letter stated, "Professor Lin's experience as a world-leading expert has served as an asset for the Chinese astronomical community, raising the profile and boosting the visibility of astronomy in the country and cultivating the next generation of Chinese astronomers."</p>
<p>Lin was honored recently with the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/06/doug-lin-award.html">Brouwer Award</a> from the Division of Dynamical Astronomy of the American Astronomical Society for his achievements and contributions to this field. He has received both a Humboldt Fellowship and a Guggenheim Fellowship and has held a number of distinguished academic positions, including Honorary Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, Lecar Lecturer at Harvard University, Rothchild Professor at the Isaac Newton Institute of Cambridge University, and the Carnegie Centenary Professor at the University of St. Andrews. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002.</p>
<p>Lin earned his B.S. from McGill University and his Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics from Cambridge University. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1979. During his career to date, he has published over 225 peer-reviewed articles and has been cited over 15,600 times.</p>

<p>While there is no evidence that our campus was impacted by this attack, there are steps we should all take to protect the continued security of our systems and networks: &#160;</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure that your computer and mobile devices are up to date with the latest software and operating system updates and patches.</p>
<p>&#8226; Review electronic devices under your control (including computers, tablets, phones, and memory sticks) and remove or secure any files that contain sensitive information about individuals.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8226; Be aware of email and phishing messages asking for personal information.&#160;Ensure that you have strong passwords and that you never share them with anyone.</p>
<p>Our information technology team works hard to keep our networks secure and will continue to educate the campus community about how we can protect our personal data. More information is available <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/security/index.html">online</a>, including "<a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/security/top10.html">Top 10 Good Computing Practices</a>."</p>
<p>What happened at UCLA is a call to action for us all. We must work together as an institution and as individuals to protect our computers, our networks, and our data from inappropriate activity.</p>

Gliessman Presidential Chair in Water Resources and Food System Sustainability.</p>
<p>The Gliessman chair, one of the most recently endowed chairs on campus, was announced Friday at a celebration of the first endowed chair, the Ruth and Alfred E. Heller Chair in Agroecology founded in 1982. Environmental studies professor Stephen R. Gliessman held it until his retirement five years ago. The past meets the present and looks toward the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite an honor to receive this,&#8221; said Gliessman, who joined UCSC in 1981. &#8220;And I&#8217;m not dead yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alec Webster, (&#8217;02, College Eight, environmental studies), said his family helped fund the new chair to focus on water and sustainability issues and to honor Gliessman for his decades of promoting agroecology &#8211; the application of ecological principles to agricultural settings &#8211; particularly when it wasn&#8217;t popular.</p>
<p><strong>International expert<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to honor Steve because he&#8217;s the international expert in the field,&#8221; said Webster, who arrived at UC Santa Cruz in 1987 to work at the Santa Cruz Institute of Particle Physics as a machinist and lab technician. Income from endowed chairs provides funding for faculty salaries and research support including graduate fellowships.</p>
<p>Webster and his wife Claudia (UC Santa Barbara, &#8217;75, art) are major supporters of UC Santa Cruz and serve on the Social Sciences Dean&#8217;s Board of Councilors. Alec serves on the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board of Trustees and also served on the South Campus Vision Council, which led to the Webster Foundation providing a gift for renovation and programming for the Cowell Ranch Hay Barn, which will be a hub of food sustainability activities on campus.</p>
<p><strong>'Agroecologia'</strong></p>
<p>Gliessman and colleagues in southern Mexico coined the term &#8220;agroecology&#8221; nearly 40 years ago, pronouncing it &#8220;agroecologia&#8221; in Spanish. UCSC&#8217;s agroecology program, now within the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), was the first UC project to focus on what&#8217;s become known as sustainable agriculture systems and on research in organic production techniques.</p>
<p>The new chair will be held by a faculty member in the environmental studies department and is one of eight new chairs at UCSC under a program initiated by UC President Janet Napolitano to offer matching funds if campuses raise $500,000 per chair. Increasing support for endowed chairs is a goal of the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu"><strong><em>Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</em></strong></a>, which has&#160;raised more than $210 million for the campus. An international search has begun to recruit the first holder of the Gliessman chair.</p>
<p>Alfred E. Heller was honored at Friday&#8217;s celebration next to the soon-to-be completed hay barn. The event was part of Agroecology World Fair Day held in conjunction with the 16<sup>th</sup> annual International Shortcourse in Agroecology that Gliessman organizes each year and attracts nearly three dozen researchers and practitioners from around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Alfred Heller's garden visit</strong></p>
<p>Heller recalled how he came to fund the first endowed chair. He met with English gardener Alan Chadwick in the 1970s at the campus garden where Chadwick transformed three acres of poison oak and brush into organic horticulture. &#8220;This was an exciting time,&#8221; Heller said. &#8220;I looked at the garden and he lectured me for an entire afternoon. I was sold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole purpose,&#8221; Heller said, &#8220;was to get the university to buy in academically, to get the faculty behind it.&#8221; Gliessman said the Heller chair gave agroecology legitimacy in the&#160; academic world.</p>
<p>&#160;By 1980, concerns over conventional agriculture's impacts on soil and groundwater, pesticide-resistant "super pests," and a growing interest in organic farming made UCSC&#8217;s farm and garden relevant to a broader audience. The environmental studies board proposed a new program in agroecology with the farm and garden as its headquarters.</p>
<p>Gliessman became holder of the Heller chair in 1982, the year after he joined the campus. &#160;He subsequently wrote the textbook <em>Agroecology</em>, which has just been released in a third edition.</p>
<p>Daniel Press, executive director of CASFS, praised Heller and Gliessman as heroes. &#8220;It is testament to the vision of Alfred Heller that was not only counter-cultural but counter-institutional,&#8221; Press said. &#8220;His vision to make this happen in 1980 is extraordinary.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Agroecology's global growth</strong></p>
<p>Gliessman said the agroecology movement has expanded from literally planting fields to the entire food system. &#8220;It&#8217;s layers,&#8221; he said earlier in the week during the shortcourse he leads each year. &#8220;It started with the soil, moved to the table, and now includes policy changes. We&#8217;re looking at the entire system of social food justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s shortcourse is aptly titled &#8220;Agroecology, a Global Movement: Tracing our Roots and Looking Forward.&#8221; It began July 12 and continues on campus through Saturday. It is organized by the Community Agroecology Network (CAN), the non-profit organization Gliessman and Roberta Jaffe, his wife, founded in 2002.</p>
<p>The course alternates between a U.S. university (UCSC this year, University of Vermont two years ago) and one of CAN&#8217;s partner communities in Latin America (Nicaragua last year, Mexico next year). Thirty-two participants have come to Santa Cruz from Africa, Europe, South America, the U.S., and Canada to learn, share, and experience agroecology. They&#8217;ve been working and studying with CASFS, and on farms in Watsonville and Davenport.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;This is one of the most diverse groups we&#8217;ve ever had,&#8221; Gliessman said. &#8220;It reflects a global movement in agroecology.&#8221;</p>

href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a> has received a $2 million grant from the W. M. Keck Foundation for ongoing research to develop a comprehensive map of human genetic variation. The Human Genome Variation Map will be a valuable new resource for medical researchers, as well as for basic research on human evolution and diversity.</p>
<p>The Keck grant provides funding over two years for UC Santa Cruz researchers to create a full-scale map, building on the results of a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/genome-variation.html">one-year pilot project</a> funded by the Simons Foundation.</p>
<p>"We've been experimenting with pilot regions of the genome and evaluating a variety of methods. The next steps will be to take it from a prototype to a full-scale genome reference that we can release to the community," said Benedict Paten, a research scientist at the Genomics Institute and co-principal investigator of the project.</p>
<p>The Human Genome Variation Map is needed to overcome the limitations of using a single reference sequence for the human genome. Currently, new data from sequencing human genomes is analyzed by mapping the new sequences to one reference set of 24 human chromosomes to identify variants. But this approach leads to biases and mapping ambiguities, and some variants simply cannot be described with respect to the reference genome, according to David Haussler, distinguished professor of biomolecular engineering and scientific director of the Genomics Institute at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Global Alliance</strong></p>
<p>Haussler and Paten are coordinating their work on the new map with the <a href="http://genomicsandhealth.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health</a> (GA4GH), which involves more than 300 collaborating institutions that have agreed to work together to enable secure sharing of genomic and clinical data. The overall vision of the global alliance includes a genomics platform based on something akin to the planned Human Genome Variation Map, along with open-source software tools to enable researchers to mine the data for new scientific and medical breakthroughs. In the long run, the map will be used to identify genomic variants encountered in precision medical care as well, Haussler said.</p>
<p>The UCSC team has been collaborating with leading genomics researchers at other institutions to develop the map, which Paten began working on in 2014 as co-chair of the GA4GH Reference Variation Task Team. The new Human Genome Variation Map will replace the current assortment of isolated, incompatible databases of human genetic variation with a single, fundamental representation formalized as a very large mathematical graph. The clean mathematical formulation is a major strength of this new approach, Paten said.</p>
<p>The primary reference genome is a linear sequence of DNA bases (represented by the letters A, C, T, and G). To build the Human Genome Variation Map, each new genome will be merged into the reference genome at the points where it matches the primary sequence, with variations appearing as additional alternate paths in the map.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical structure</strong></p>
<p>This mathematical graph-based structure will augment the existing human reference genome with all common human variations, providing a means to name, identify, and analyze variations precisely and reproducibly. "The original human reference genome project gave us a detailed picture of one human genome. This map will give us a detailed picture of the world's variety of human genomes," Paten said.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the original human genome project, the Human Genome Variation Map will be publicly and freely available to all. Haussler's team at UC Santa Cruz made the first human genome sequence publicly available on the Internet 15 years ago. This new project has many parallels with that earlier work, in which UCSC genomics researchers assembled and posted the first human genome sequence and went on to create the widely used UCSC Genome Browser.</p>
<p>"This is an infrastructure project for genomics that everyone agrees is important," Paten said. "It is ambitious, and it requires a fundamental shift from thinking of the reference as one sequence to thinking of it as this structure that incorporates all variation. But now is the time to do it. We need to build a model that works, and make it easy enough to use to get community acceptance."</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute is a fundraising priority of the $300-million <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>.</p>
<p><strong>W. M. Keck Foundation</strong></p>

Curtis Outstanding Woman in Science Award to Priya Ganguli, who earned her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The award recognizes Ganguli, now at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, for the impact of her Ph.D. research, which shed light on many unknown and uncharacterized processes that influence mercury dynamics in coastal ecosystems. Her work has created a rapidly growing area of research.</p>
<p>After earning her master's degree in 1998, Ganguli worked for the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board as a geologist and environmental specialist, working on large-scale mine-site and wetland remediation projects, before returning to UCSC to pursue her Ph.D. For her master's thesis, Ganguli studied mercury in acid mine drainage from the abandoned New Idria mercury mine, now an EPA superfund site. Her Ph.D. thesis focused on mercury contamination in coastal groundwater and the ocean. Russell Flegal, professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology, was her advisor for both degrees.</p>
<p>Ganguli will be honored during an awards ceremony on November 1 at the GSA's 2015 Annual Meeting &amp; Exposition in Baltimore.</p>
<p>The Doris M. Curtis Outstanding Woman in Science Award is awarded annually to a woman who has impacted the field of the geosciences in a major way based on her Ph.D. research. Doris Curtis was the GSA's 103rd president. Her popularity was widespread and she pioneered many new directions for geology, not the least of which was her tenure as GSA president after an unbroken chain of 102 men.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.priyaganguli.com/</url><title>Priya Ganguli's web site</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b7e2902480727017391d58adb7e42e52"><name>power-outage</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Power outage early a.m. July 22</title><summary>Last night there were two power outages (one from approximately 12 a.m. to 2 a.m. and a second from 3:15 a.m. to 4 a.m.) that impacted the whole campus except for Family Student Housing and Lower Campus.  </summary><start-date>1437561000000</start-date><display-name>July 22 power outage</display-name><path>/2015/07/power-outage</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/07/power-outage</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1437604155401</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1437604244490</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>On behalf of Physical Plant and the Office of Emergency Services, I am providing this update and advisory.<br/>
 <br/>
 Last night there were two power outages (one from approximately 12 a.m. to 2 a.m. and a second from 3:15 a.m. to 4 a.m.) that impacted the whole campus except for Family Student Housing and Lower Campus.&#160; Consistent with campus emergency preparedness, emergency power systems provided support for mission critical functions.&#160; <br/>
 <br/>

Here is a link to the original, updated July 19, 2015 4:54 p.m. ET</em></p>
<p>&#160;<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-magic-of-tidying-updigitally-1437338785">http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-magic-of-tidying-updigitally-1437338785</a></p>
<p>One day, when cleaning my home using Marie Kondo&#8217;s method for organizing your stuff, I found myself wondering whether her techniques could apply to my digital life. By the end of the weeks long personal transformation that ensued, I found myself listening to a scientist who insisted that you can predict someone&#8217;s personality just by looking at how organized is their computer desktop.</p>
<p>But before we discuss the neuroscience of how you navigate your computer (yes, researchers are sticking people in brain scanners to investigate this sort of thing) let&#8217;s start with <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/marie-kondo-and-the-tidying-up-trend-1424970535">Ms. Kondo&#8217;s international best-selling book, &#8220;The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>For anyone living under a rock, this slim volume has spawned a global movement, in which proponents declare on social media that they have just &#8220;Kondo&#8217;d&#8221; their closets, kids&#8217; bedrooms, etc. The mechanics are simple: You pile up everything you own in the middle of the floor, and one by one you hold each object and ask yourself if it sparks joy. Only once you have handled everything you own can you organize it, jettisoning what doesn&#8217;t pass the joy test. Oh, and you have to do this all at once, in a single go.</p>
<p>Most of Ms. Kondo&#8217;s book is devoted to convincing you that her method actually works. Admonishments like: &#8220;When you put your house in order, you put your affairs and your past in order,&#8221; litter the book. But in my experience, once you&#8217;ve tried it, you know.</p>
<p>The problem for me was, how do I apply to ephemeral digital objects a method that involves probing our emotions about a thing by touching them? On a hunch, I started with my iPhone, since it has a touch-based interface.</p>
<p>A funny thing happened when I touched each app on my phone and considered tapping the &#8220;x&#8221; that would delete it. I instantly knew which sparked joy. In just a few minutes, I had Kondo&#8217;d my phone just as thoroughly as my closet. I dumped more than a dozen apps from a device whose contents I thought I had already trimmed to the bone. I recommend you try it.</p>
<p>The next step was to reorganize my newly airy phone. But figuring out how to do that would have to wait until later in my spiritual journey.</p>
<p>Emboldened by this first small victory, I began consulting with experts about how they organized their digital lives. Wall Street Journal personal-technology columnist <a href="http://topics.wsj.com/person/S/Joanna-Stern/7872">Joanna Stern</a> confessed to me that she is &#8220;kind of a hoarder,&#8221; and then sent me a list of columns she had written on how to tame every part of your digital life, including <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/take-back-control-of-your-email-inbox-without-breaking-a-sweat-1409078835">email</a>, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-up-your-messy-android-and-iphone-contacts-without-going-mad-1429637144">contacts</a>, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-photos-review-why-google-beats-apple-at-organizing-your-lifes-memories-1433266299">photos</a> and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/best-iphone-android-web-calendar-apps-how-to-fix-your-broken-digital-calendar-1405447842">calendars</a>, all of which I found useful.</p>
<p>Per Ms. Stern&#8217;s advice, I used the service Unroll.me to unsubscribe from dozens of newsletters and promotional emails, which suddenly made all those other tabs in Gmail (promotions, updates, etc.) useful again. I had also long ago switched to cloud-based services for managing all of my photos, music and documents, entrusting search and learning algorithms to manage these things for me. When digitally Kondo-ing, the cloud is essential.</p>
<p>But what I really wanted was to understand not just my own path toward a fully Kondo&#8217;d digital life, but all the paths. Was there a universal route to a noise and junk-free experience on the ever-proliferating family of screens in our lives?</p>
<p>Steve Whittaker, professor of human computer interaction at the University of California at Santa Cruz, is one of the few experts in these matters. One thing he has discovered through his research is that everyone organizes digital objects&#8212;files, emails, to-do items&#8212;differently, and is fiercely loyal to their own particular methods, even when they are shown evidence that theirs isn&#8217;t the best way.</p>
<p>Take email: One thing Mr. Whittaker revealed in a 2011 study is that people who file away their emails are no better at finding them in the future than those who don&#8217;t organize them at all, and simply rely on search for retrieval. For me, this confirmed one way that the digital world is forever different from the physical: Online, you have to know which organizational tasks to more or less give up on. I may have unsubscribed to all those newsletters, but I didn&#8217;t, it seems, need to tidy up the 4,572 unread emails in my inbox.</p>
<p>In all other areas, however, cleaning up is key. &#8220;In the personal domain, if you want to find stuff again it&#8217;s important that you impose organization on it,&#8221; says Mr. Whittaker. This is in part because humans are bad at predicting how we will want to access information as our future selves.</p>
<p>But organization is also a function of our personalities. In another paper, Mr. Whittaker and his colleagues discovered that neurotic people are more likely to spread files across their desktops, while conscientious people are more likely to file them away neatly. In yet-to-be-published research, Mr. Whittaker reveals that when people navigate to files in a graphic user interface, they are using an older area of their brain, evolutionarily speaking, than when they find things with desktop search, which uses the overdeveloped neocortex that distinguishes us from our ancestors.</p>
<p>The final stop on my journey was my own personal Yoda on matters of organization, journalist and filmmaker John Pavlus. <a href="https://medium.com/@johnpavlus/i-don-t-even-know-how-many-apps-i-have-on-my-phone-anymore-f8101eba96b0">In a blog post from June</a>, he proposed the most radical reorganization of a smartphone I had ever heard: Just dump all your apps into a single folder and use search to navigate to the one you need at any given moment.</p>
<p>At first his proposal seemed crazy, but I used this method&#8212;the proof is on homescreen sharing site <a href="http://homescreen.is/mims">homescreen.is under username @mims</a>&#8212;and it transformed my mobile experience. I used to let the grid of apps inform me about what to do next, but now that they are out of sight, my relationship with my smartphone feels almost entirely task-oriented and driven by my own desires.</p>
<p>Or, as Marie Kondo wrote in her book, &#8220;Tidying is just a tool, not the final destination. The true goal should be to establish the lifestyle you want most once your house has been put in order.&#8221;</p>

awarded a $30,000 grant to support an innovative artist residency and exhibition developed by the Institute of the Arts and Sciences (IAS) at UC Santa Cruz and the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in San Jose--in collaboration with the UC Lick Observatory.</p>
<p>The residency brings artist Russell Crotty, a 2015 Guggenheim Fellow, to the observatory to use Lick telescopes for direct observations and photographs that will serve as the basis for new, astronomy-based artworks.</p>
<p>Crotty is a nationally recognized artist and an advanced amateur astronomer who has created drawings and sculpture about astronomical subjects for nearly two decades.</p>
<p>The collaboration will result in an exhibition at the San Jose ICA in 2016, combining Crotty&#8217;s new work with objects and images from Lick&#8217;s rich historical archive.</p>
<p>This year, only seven organizations west of the Rockies received a Warhol Foundation grant. &#8220;Warhol grants are a real stamp of approval from a respected, national funder,&#8221; noted Cathy Kimball, executive director of the ICA in San Jose. &#8220;We are all delighted to have this recognition and support.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is truly a unique collaboration, and the Warhol Foundation recognized that,&#8221; added John Weber, director of the IAS at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;We are working with a distinguished artist, bringing him together with the ICA, Lick Observatory, and scientists, artists, and students at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to UCSC Arts Dean David Yager, &#8220;This is something that a museum or art space can&#8217;t do alone, and it involves scientific research and resources that artists rarely get access to. It&#8217;s a great example of the unique potential of the IAS project as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crotty will be at Lick for at least five visits, making sketches, working with the staff to take photos, and then bringing those materials back to his studio in Ventura, California, to inspire new work.&#160; Along with unique access to Lick telescopes and scientific facilities on Mount Hamilton, Crotty&#8217;s residency includes research&#160;time with the trove of historical photographs, astronomical instruments, and observation log books in the Lick Archive.&#160;</p>
<p>During daylight hours, he will also be working with Lick archive curator Tony Misch to survey astronomers&#8217; drawings and notes from the 19th century, both to inform his own work, and for possible inclusion in the ICA show. The show will include historic photographs and objects from the Lick instrument collection.</p>
<p>On recent visits to the UC Santa Cruz campus, Crotty has been meeting with faculty and students from the TASC group (Theoretical Astrophysics Santa Cruz) as well as Lick staff, absorbing new developments in astrophysics and astronomy.</p>
<p>To reach students and the community, his residency will include a stargazing night on campus in the Great Meadow, co-organized by astronomy students. A special, two-day student seminar at Lick Observatory will also bring Crotty together with students and faculty in the visual arts and astronomy to consider the nature of &#8220;seeing&#8221; and &#8220;knowing&#8221; in their respective disciplines.</p>
<p>&#8220;The outcome of Crotty's time on Mount Hamilton and at UC Santa Cruz will be&#160;an exciting hybrid exhibition of art, cosmological history, and science, opening at the ICA in November 2016,&#8221; said Weber. &#8220;At the time of the exhibition, events at the ICA will introduce the project to Silicon Valley audiences, casting a spotlight on Lick&#8217;s history and the strong track record of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz."</p>
<p>Along with Warhol funding, the Russell Crotty residency is also being supported by a grant from the UC Santa Cruz Foundation&#8217;s Board Opportunity Fund, the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division, and by the Alumni Fund for Visiting Artists, recently established by pioneer alumnus Jock Reynolds.</p>

<p>The report, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132651">published July 22 in <em>PLOS ONE</em></a>, targets the statewide issue of risky coastal developments that are currently in danger of flooding and that also impair floodplains' natural abilities to protect coastal communities from flooding. The report's authors have developed an easy-to-use method that identifies the areas where the greatest risk reduction and habitat conservation benefits can be achieved simultaneously through FEMA hazard mitigation projects in California.</p>
<p>"We developed a multi-objective approach to identify areas where the greatest risk reduction and habitat conservation benefits can be achieved simultaneously in California, effectively killing two birds with one stone," said lead author Juliano Calil, a Ph.D. candidate in the Ocean Sciences Department at UC Santa Cruz. "We are facing very complex environmental and socioeconomic problems around the world at an unprecedented scale. Approaches like the one we've developed, where distinct goals are combined into multi-objective projects, are going to be essential to solve these issues. It just doesn't make sense to talk about reducing future flood risks and damages without considering restoring floodplains."</p>
<p><strong>Flood insurance claims</strong></p>
<p>The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), under FEMA, has paid out more than $38 billion in claims since its inception in 1968. More than $12 billion were paid to the one percent of policies that experienced multiple losses and are classified as "repetitive loss properties" or RLPs. Since 2012, more than $150 million in flood insurance claims were paid by FEMA to more than 3,200 California property owners.</p>
<p>California lost 91 percent of its coastal wetlands, more than 4.5 million acres, from 1780 to 1980, making it the state with the highest losses of wetlands in the country. Sonoma County, a hotspot of repetitive loss in California, occupies roughly 1 percent of the total area of California, but accounts for 32 percent of all NFIP claims in the state.</p>
<p>"Unless we reduce risk globally, annual flood losses may top $1 trillion by the year 2050," said coauthor Sarah Newkirk, coastal director of the California Chapter of the Nature Conservancy. "Risk reduction by fortifying unwise development will cause further loss of wetlands, but conservation and restoration of floodplains that act as buffers to coastal structures will help fisheries, beaches, and coastal communities."</p>
<p><strong>Threefold benefits</strong></p>
<p>The benefits from the approach presented in the study are threefold: (a) structures removed from floodplains take people and property out of harm's way; (b) restored floodplains protect communities and provide invaluable ecosystem services; and (c) FEMA reduces its exposure by tackling the most risky structures and enhancing nature's ability to buffer floods.</p>
<p>A few other highlights from the study include the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>32 structures in the State of California filed 9 or more claims against the NFIP since its inception.</li>
<li>11,243 square kilometers in coastal California represent both flood exposure reduction and conservation value where property/structure buyouts and habitat restoration projects could be implemented simultaneously.</li>
<li>Nearly all of the RLPs in Sonoma County (95.3 percent, or 813 properties) are located in areas where Flood Exposure and Conservation interests overlap.</li>

Bob received his education and training at some of the top research institutions in this country and in Europe. Following his undergraduate education in chemistry at the University of Michigan, he did his graduate studies in the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale, where he pursued his doctoral research with Bill Summers on regulation of transcription in bacteriophage T7. He then did his postdoctoral research first with Luigi Gorini at Harvard Medical School and then with Ethan Signer at MIT, where he began studying the mechanisms of nitrogen fixation. After a subsequent stay in the laboratory of plant molecular biologist Geoff Schell in Ghent, Belgium, he came to Santa Cruz to start his own laboratory.</p>
<p>Bob Ludwig's research was driven as much by his passionate sense of social responsibility as by his fascination with basic science. His main concerns were two of the most pressing problems facing humanity: feeding a burgeoning world population, and providing a source of clean energy. The main body of his work focused on the mechanism of nitrogen fixation, the process by which the inert nitrogen gas that makes up 80 percent of the air in our atmosphere is captured in a form that can be used by the living organisms that create our food. His approaches were ingenious and subtle, employing the powerful methods of molecular genetics in novel contexts to understand and manipulate the genes responsible for fixing nitrogen by the bacteria that inhabit the root nodules of leguminous plants. The design of his experiments was often characterized by an intricate logic that would credit a chess master.</p>
<p>The final phase of Bob's research focused on another fundamental global problem: creating a means for the production of clean energy. His studies on nitrogen fixation led him to ask whether the enzymes associated with the bacteria living in root nodules might be used to generate hydrogen gas. Bob's last published papers provide encouragement for this exciting possibility.</p>
<p>Bob was a gifted and dedicated teacher, whose biochemistry and genetics lectures inspired a generation of budding science students. This was recognized by the Favorite Professor Award, which Bob received in 1992 from the UCSC Student Alumni Council.</p>
<p>He attracted many talented students to his laboratory, whom he trained in the methods, experimental strategies and philosophy of molecular genetics.</p>
<p>In his private life, Bob enjoyed the pursuit of diverse interests that reflected his sophisticated tastes. These included an appreciation of fine food and wine, which extended to a considerable talent for both winemaking and cooking. His eclectic enthusiasms ranged from international soccer to modern jazz and progressive political causes. Bob is survived by his wife Pamela Swift, his son Max, and his daughter Chlo&#235;. His presence and unique, idealistic spirit will be deeply missed by his students and colleagues.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Harry Noller, Robert L.

<p>This highly competitive scholarship program supports masters students for up to two years and doctoral students for up to four years. Kienle is a Ph.D. student co-advised by professors Daniel Costa and Rita Mehta. Her thesis project will examine the foraging ecology and habitat use of male northern elephant seals from multiple breeding colonies along the species range. Male northern elephant seals forage more coastally than female seals and overlap with several national marine sanctuaries, including Channel Islands, Monterey Bay, Greater Farallones, Olympic Coast and Cordell Bank. Kienle hopes this research will provide insights into how individuals, particularly males, will be differentially affected by climate change across the range of the species.</p>
<p>The scholarships were established in memory of Nancy Foster, a leader in marine resource conservation, a former assistant NOAA administrator for oceanic services and coastal zone management, and past director of NOAA's National Ocean Service. Congress created the scholarship in 2000 as a way to honor her life's work, 23 years of service to NOAA, and her contribution to the nation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c1e7010d80727017391d58ad6af0dd9e"><name>management-skills-assessment-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Management Skills Assessment Program (MSAP) – Call for Applications  </title><summary>Staff Human Resources is pleased to announce recruitment for the Fall 2015 Management Skills Assessment Program (MSAP). </summary><start-date>1437721200000</start-date><display-name>Management Skills Assessment Program (MSAP) – Call for Applications  </display-name><path>/2015/07/management-skills-assessment-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/07/management-skills-assessment-program</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1437772218576</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1437772218576</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Staff Human Resources is pleased to announce recruitment for the Fall 2015 Management Skills Assessment Program (MSAP).&#160; The program is designed to assess the management skills of high-potential, early-career supervisors, managers, and professionals for future leadership opportunities at the University.&#160; Previously, MSAP was offered in alternating Northern and Southern California locations, but is now held at the UCLA Conference Center in Lake Arrowhead for all of the UC campuses. &#160;Starting in Fall 2014, the program has been modified and improved, based on feedback from participants and organizers. &#160;</p>

The prohibition is in accordance with the campus Coastal Long Range Development Plan (CLRDP) that was approved by the California Coastal Commision in 2009.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/BAS/BAS-002.html">updated policy</a> aligns the Coastal Science Campus with the restriction on domestic animals at the main campus. The policy exempts service animals, as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (<a href="http://www.ada.gov/2010_regs.htm">ADA</a>).</p>
<p>This policy change generated strong interest from community members who walk their dogs on the coastal trails. University leaders carefully reviewed extensive feedback as well as the original environmental studies that recommended the domestic animal prohibition for the Coastal Science Campus.</p>
<p>"This is a big change for the community and I appreciate the input and concern that has been raised by many who don't want to see the change," Chancellor George Blumenthal said. "Following extensive consultation with staff and thoughtful consideration to the mission of the Younger Lagoon Reserve program, the policy change aligns with the vision for the campus that includes extensive restoration of the land to its native coastal habitat. This space will be used for teaching and research and to train the next generation of scientists and coastal conservationists."</p>
<p>The CLRDP required that nearly three-quarters of the site be protected as a natural reserve and restored to native habitats. The campus has committed to implementing a major, 20-year restoration plan on the Younger Lagoon Reserve.</p>
<p>In the past and as an exception to the University Non-Research Animal Policy, leashed dogs have been permitted on the site's public access trails. However, many dog owners have not complied with this and off-leash dogs are particularly disruptive to wildlife, teaching and research activities.</p>
<p>The campus will continue with an education campaign to let visitors know about the policy change and that domestic animals are no longer allowed on the campus including the trails. People who bring non-service animals on site, especially owners who allow their dogs off leash, may be cited. The campus anticipates that citations will at a minimum be $50 plus applicable court costs.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d199ff8480727017391d58adcf9eb948"><name>surfing-faculty</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Surfing the web of life</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz faculty members who ride the waves say the sport is beautiful and spiritual—and allows their minds the space to wander.</summary><keywords>Surfing, UCSC, Bill Saxton, Gary Silberstein, Erika Zavaleta, Don Croll, Terrie Williams, Mike and Sarah Gerhardt, William Finnegan</keywords><start-date>1437980400000</start-date><display-name>Surfing the web of life</display-name><path>/2015/07/surfing-faculty</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/07/surfing-faculty</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1438035607399</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1440182309702</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/07/images/zavaleta-erika-surfboards-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/07/images/zavaleta-erika-surfboards-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zavaleta-erika-surfboards-300.jpg</name><display-name>zavaleta-erika-surfboards-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>88453</file-size><width>300</width><height>224</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies Professor Erika Zavaleta Erika Zavaleta with her son, </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/07/images/lane-waves-thumb.JPG</path><link>site://news/2015/07/images/lane-waves-thumb.JPG</link><site>news</site><name>lane-waves-thumb.JPG</name><display-name>lane-waves-thumb.JPG</display-name><file-size>16279</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Steamer Lane waves</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies Professor Erika Zavaleta with her son, Russell, holding pieces of the board she broke surfing in Truncones, Mexico.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/07/images/lane-waves-300.JPG</path><link>site://news/2015/07/images/lane-waves-300.JPG</link><site>news</site><name>lane-waves-300.JPG</name><display-name>lane-waves-300.JPG</display-name><file-size>84880</file-size><width>300</width><height>295</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Santa Cruz's Steamer Lane, just down the hill from campus, is a legendary surf spot that has long attracted UC Santa Cruz students, faculty, and staff alike. (Photo by Gwen Jourdonnais)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC Santa Cruz faculty members who ride the waves say the sport is beautiful and spiritual—and allows their minds the space to wander</article-subhead><article-text><p><strong>Editor's note:</strong> <em>UC Santa Cruz alumnus,</em> New Yorker <em>staff writer, and surfer William Finnegan (Cowell '74, English literature) talked about and read from his new book</em> Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life <em>on</em>&#160;<em>July 28 at Santa Cruz Mountain Brewing. His appearance was part of a new series called "Books and Brews," sponsored by Bookshop Santa Cruz.</em></p>
<p>In the dark hour that is 3:30 a.m., Bill Saxton will often rise from his bed, pull on a wetsuit, and head for the surf spot called Steamer Lane.</p>
<p>There, the UC Santa Cruz professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology will slip into the water and, against the barest illumination from street lamps and a spotlight atop a small lighthouse, watch dark shapes of waves rise up behind him.</p>
<p>Sometimes he'll catch the rolling humps of water, which send him speeding over the ocean's surface like a fighter-jet pilot skimming across land. Sometimes he will misjudge the waves and be tumbled and thrashed.</p>
<p>But in those first black minutes before the sky eventually lightens, he says, he is always alone, and being alone in the ocean feels like being in the wilderness. Which, for a boy who grew up in the woods, is a peaceful and good place to be.</p>
<p>"It feels like home," he says.</p>
<p>Saxton, 62, who studies cell transport mechanisms, is one of about a dozen UC Santa Cruz faculty members who can be found riding waves when they're not teaching, researching, or writing. They are men and women, scientists and sociologists, and they say surfing not only provides a closeness with nature but also a sense of play and a challenge that leaves little room for being anywhere but in the present moment.</p>
<h3>Surfing: Aesthetic, beautiful, spiritual</h3>
<p>"Surfing is aesthetic. It's beautiful," says retired UC Santa Cruz Research Biologist Gary Silberstein, 73, who came to UC Santa Cruz in 1978 specifically because of its proximity to waves. "It's good for your body. It's spiritual in a way."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies Professor Erika Zavaleta, 43, began surfing as a grad student at Stanford University after her sister persuaded her to take a trip to San Onofre, where they hired a tall, grasshopper-thin surfer to teach them how to ride waves.</p>
<p>Zavaleta was hooked. Her sister: not so much.</p>
<p>There is a certain playfulness to being propelled forward by moving walls of water, says Zavaleta &#8212; a sense of being able to harness an elemental force created by wind and tides and gravity. It's one of the few sanctioned places where an adult can just play.</p>
<p>But there is also a contemplative side to the sport, what some even call spiritual.</p>
<p>"So much of surfing is waiting," Zavaleta says. "There you are in this place, surrounded by motion and light, and you're waiting. And, at least for certain periods, your mind can just wander."</p>
<p>She describes sitting in "this sea of light and movement" with the sound of birds and water filling her ears and the sharp smell of kelp touching her nose. Beneath her is a host of sea life and above her is the sky.</p>
<p>"It's an incredible sensory experience," she says.</p>
<p>"You're outside yourself. You're connected to this energy flow," Silberstein says, then gives a self-deprecating laugh. "Time is different out there (in the waves). Time is different anytime you lose yourself."</p>
<p>And being lost, he says, "is when the brain sorts stuff out."</p>
<h3>The great equalizer</h3>
<p>Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Don Croll, 57, started surfing in sixth grade in Southern California. He remembers sitting in Sunday school and staring out the window at a nearby surf break named Haggerty's, made famous in the Beach Boys song "Surfin' USA."</p>
<p>"I spent my time watching the surfers instead of learning about Jesus," Croll says. "I found a different religion."</p>
<p>Croll rides a 9-foot, high-performance longboard shaped by local Bob Pearson, catching waves whenever and wherever he can. Out in the water, he rubs shoulders with fellow wave hunters who run the gamut, from scruffy guys who sleep in their cars, to high-priced lawyers, to carpenters.</p>
<p>"When you're out in the waves, it's just a bunch of guys out surfing," says Croll. "It's an equalizer." He likes that.</p>
<p>It's also an adrenaline rush, a heady combination of speed, danger, beauty, and risk. Surfers tell of being "tubed," embraced in a tunnel of green water as if it were a womb; of catching perfect waves; of sensing the eerie presence of sharks in the evening dusk; of being held under the water by a series of waves until they think they might drown.</p>
<h3>Heart rate research</h3>
<p>In fact, UC Santa Cruz Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Terrie Williams was inspired by Croll to wire up husband-and-wife professional surfers Mike and Sarah Gerhardt (Sarah received her Ph.D. in physical chemistry from UC Santa Cruz) with the same heart monitors she uses on dolphins and seals as part of a research project she was conducting.</p>
<p>Sending the pair out into an infamous big-wave spot called Mavericks near Half Moon Bay, the monitors documented "one of the longest, near max heart rate records for any sport measured to date," Williams says.</p>
<p>"Basically, professional surfers are not exactly the laid-back dudes of the movies," Williams says. "Rather, there is an adrenaline extreme sports rush they go for compared to the novice."</p>
<p>Standing at the cliff's edge at a local surf spot called "Privates," Silberstein tells of his own adrenaline moment when he and a buddy went out to surf Ocean Beach in San Francisco as teenagers.</p>
<p>The spot is notorious for rough waves and swift currents, and, after losing his board, Silberstein and his friend were swept out to sea.</p>
<p>Wearing only flimsy wetsuit jackets, they were shoved north for three hours in bone-chilling water until the Coast Guard finally rescued them. Silberstein's friend was near death from hypothermia.</p>
<p>And yet, Silberstein never stopped surfing. In fact, a journal he's kept since the 1980s shows 2,750 wave-riding sessions.</p>
"Surfing has guided my entire life," he says.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d6932170807270171b1d43905f977f5f"><name>madyson-middleton</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A loss that touches us all</title><summary>With many in the community, we are grieving the tragic death of Madyson "Maddy" Middleton, the 8-year-old girl whose disappearance Sunday prompted a tremendous outpouring of concern.</summary><start-date>1438119000000</start-date><display-name>Madyson 'Maddy' Middleton</display-name><path>/2015/07/madyson-middleton</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/07/madyson-middleton</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1438119043378</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1438119078185</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With many in the community, we are grieving the tragic death of Madyson "Maddy" Middleton, the 8-year-old girl whose disappearance Sunday prompted a tremendous outpouring of concern.<br/>
<br/>
 Maddy's disappearance galvanized residents of Santa Cruz County&#8212;and beyond. We were moved by the number of volunteers who rallied to help find Maddy, and we are heartsick about the outcome of the search. We offer our condolences to Maddy's family, many friends and loved ones, and to the countless numbers who were touched by her story.<br/>

 The 2014 payroll data, along with a summary analysis, is available online at <a href="http://compensation.universityofcalifornia.edu/payroll2014/">http://compensation.universityofcalifornia.edu/payroll2014/</a> The data will also be available to news media upon request.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Because UC is a public institution, employee compensation is considered a public record under the California Public Records Act and is reflected in the staff personnel policy in Personnel Policies for Staff Members <a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4010419/PPSM-80">(PPSM 80(C)</a>:<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 &#8220;Information which is public information and which should be released upon request includes name, date of hire, current position title, current salary, organizational unit assignment, date of separation, office address and office telephone number, current job description, full-time or part-time, and appointment type.&#8221;<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Academic personnel policy, <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/apm/apm-160.pdf">Academic Personnel Manual (APM) 160-20(b)(4)</a> also states that any &#8220;non-personal&#8221; information &#8220;is public information and is available upon request to any person or entity without limitation.&#8221; It defines &#8220;non-personal&#8221; academic personnel information as including name, date of hire or separation, current position title, and current rate of pay.<br/>

Mellon Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The movement of people is one of the most pressing issues of our time,&#8221; the five professors outline in their proposal. &#160;The seminar is titled &#8220;Non-citizenship&#8221; and is planned by Catherine Ram&#237;rez, Latin American and Latino studies; Juan Poblete, literature; Felicity Amaya Schaeffer, feminist studies; Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, Latin American and Latino studies; and Steve McKay, sociology.</p>
<p>Open to the campus and community, the seminar &#8220;intends to foster a dialogue about belonging and rights, to shed light on the historical development of the category of the noncitizen, and to produce knowledge for a world being remade by human mobility.&#8221;&#160; The seminar will launch May 6-7, 2016 with &#8220;Keywords in Migration Studies,&#8221; an international conference at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The proposal won a $175,000 grant under the Mellon Foundation&#8217;s John E. Sawyer Seminars on the Comparative Studies of Cultures. Named for the foundation's third president, Sawyer Seminars were established in 1994 to provide support for comparative research on the historical and cultural sources of contemporary developments. The award is one of 11 Sawyer Seminars funded this year and is a first for UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Migration is a global issue not limited to cross-border travel in North and Central America. Witness Africans migrating to Europe, Iraqis and Syrians moving to Lebanon and Turkey, Haitians in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>The seminar will look at what modern citizenship means &#8220;in a world of citizens and non-citizens, such as undocumented immigrants, guest workers, permanent residents, refugees, asylum seekers, and those who are stateless.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>Among its questions: &#8220;What happens when non-citizens are prohibited from becoming citizens? And what are the rights and obligations of denizens, citizen and non-citizen alike?&#8221;</p>
<p>The term &#8220;denizen&#8221; is used to describe an inhabitant who is not a formal citizen but not an &#8220;illegal&#8221; immigrant either. Often, denizens are barred from becoming citizens, Ramirez said.&#160; Free and enslaved blacks were denizens before the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1868.</p>

The program encompasses employees governed by Professional and Support Staff (PSS), Managers and Senior Professionals (MSP) and Senior Management Group (SMG) policy programs.</p>
<p>The directions are that we budget for a 3 percent increase over non-represented staff base salaries. Our campus has chosen to utilize an across-the-board approach based upon eligibility criteria. Additional program details and implementation guidelines will be forthcoming.</p>
<p>The funding framework reached between the university and the governor allows UC to plan for annual pay increases for non-represented staff over the next several years with more certainty. It does not create new resources specifically for these pay increases, but it allows the campus to plan on a multi-year basis for the amounts needed to fund the program. It also creates an opportunity to move decisively toward performance-based pay. This approach is consistent with feedback received from staff in the most recent engagement survey, which advocated for making merit-based pay a more prominent feature in our salary programs. Predictable pay practices that are based on performance also contribute to more engaged employees and maintains the University's competitive position for talent. Thus beginning in FY 2016-17 all UC locations will be required to implement a merit-based pay for performance model.</p>
<p>We appreciate the many contributions and services provided by our staff in supporting the university's mission and goals. The implementation of this salary increase program will help to establish consistent and stable pay practices and support our efforts to remain competitive in attracting and retaining the best talent for the University.</p>
<p>Please share this information with non-represented staff employees in your organization.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC managers, supervisors, and non-represented

Regents, to establish a $1 million <strong>Jordan-Stern Presidential Chair for Dickens and Nineteenth-Century Studies.</strong></p>
<p>The gift will provide support for research and teaching of nineteenth-century literature, and the development and implementation of programs for the Dickens Project in the Humanities Division.</p>
<p>A scholarly consortium headquartered at UC Santa Cruz, <a href="http://dickens.ucsc.edu"><strong>The Dickens Project</strong></a> consists of members from more than 40 universities across the United States and around the globe.&#160;It is internationally recognized as the premier center for Dickens studies in the world and is one of the leading sites for research on 19th-century British culture.</p>
<p class="normal">Increasing support for the Humanities Division and endowed chairs are goals of the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu"><strong><em>Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</em></strong></a>, which to date has raised more than $210 million in resources for the campus.</p>
<p class="normal"><strong>John Jordan</strong> is an emeritus faculty member of the Literature Department. During his past four decades at UC Santa Cruz, he was a founding faculty member of Merrill College and one of the original founders of the Dickens Project.</p>
<p class="normal">Although he is now retired from his faculty position, Jordan will continue on as director of the Dickens Project until 2019, a position he has held for the past 30 years.</p>
<p class="normal"><strong>Michael Stern</strong> is senior counsel&#160;at Cooley LLP in Palo Alto. He received a J.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, Boalt Hall School of Law; a Ph.D. in English from Yale University; an M.A. in English from the University of Cambridge, where he was a Kellett fellow at Clare College; and a B.A. in English (<em>magna cum laude</em>, Phi Beta Kappa) from Columbia University.</p>
<p class="normal"><strong>Jordan noted that Stern discovered</strong> the Dickens Project four years ago after reading a feature story about it in the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/08/new-yorker-dickens.html"><strong><em>New Yorker</em></strong></a> magazine. &#8220;He was pleased and surprised to learn we existed and are so close to where he is in Palo Alto,&#8221; said Jordan.</p>
<p class="normal">&#8220;Reading Dickens was a formative experience for me,&#8221; said Stern. &#8220;His inimitable energy, artistry and critical vision made the prospect of doing English utterly compelling.&#8221;</p>
<p class="normal">&#8220;In his own time, Dickens bridged many gulfs--between social classes, between literary and popular culture, and between different media and modes of performance,&#8221; he added. &#8220;In our time, he continues to do so. The Dickens Project is a unique venue enabling that.&#8221;</p>
<p class="normal">&#8220;There&#8217;s no other place where great scholars and ordinary fans and lay readers like me can have a powerful collective experience interpreting and enjoying a great writer like Dickens, who continues to speak to us across two centuries. I&#8217;m honored to have the opportunity to join John in helping make sure that continues,&#8221; Stern noted.</p>
<p class="normal">Jordan pointed out that the new Presidential Chair does not replace the current Dickens $1 million endowment drive <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/08/dickens-endowment-drive.html"><strong>launched last year</strong></a> at the annual Dickens Universe gathering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p class="normal">&#8220;The $1 million endowment drive that I launched last summer is for the Friends of the Dickens Project and goes to support the outreach part of the Project--specifically the <a href="http://dickens.ucsc.edu"><strong><em>Dickens Universe</em></strong></a>,&#8221; said Jordan.</p>
<p class="normal">&#8220;The new Presidential chair is for scholarly and academic support.&#8221; The two are complementary. That&#8217;s the dual mission of the Dickens Project: public outreach in humanites, and research and teaching.</p>
<p class="normal">Jordan noted that The Friends endowment now has raised $200,000 to date, with a number of additional pledges expected over the next several years.</p>
<p class="normal">&#8220;The combination of the Presidential chair and the Friends endowment will go a long way in ensuring the Dickens Project remains financially sustainable and stays headquartered at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Jordan.</p>

<p>Raised in the small town of Gilroy by a single mother who struggled with addiction and health issues, there was little money for food and clothes &#8212; and not much emotional support. At 16, Ashley dropped out of high school in order to get a job. By 19, she&#8217;d escaped to Italy where she split her time between work and wandering the continent.</p>
<p>It was, she admits, not the kind of path that usually leads to the place she is today: an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz who works in a genetics and cell biology lab with the goal of becoming a research physician some day.</p>
<p>Ashley, 32, who acknowledges a certain amount of self-motivation, loved her life in Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there came a point when, even though I was happy and was making good money, I just felt like there was something missing,&#8221; she says. &#8220;All I did was play. I traveled and worked and played. I felt like I needed substance, like I needed to contribute. I felt like I needed to do something more.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Ashley left Italy and moved back to Gilroy. She enrolled in community college and assembled an array of part-time jobs to support herself.</p>
<p>While at Gavilan College, she was accepted into the ACCESS summer research institute at UC Santa Cruz, which gave her a taste of life in the biomedical sciences. The woman who&#8217;d never seen the inside of a research laboratory was hooked.</p>
<p>This summer, the Kresge College student majoring in molecular, cellular and developmental biology and who expects to graduate in 2016, is working in the Bhalla lab, run by Associate Professor of MCD Biology Needhi Bhalla.</p>
<p>There, Ashley is doing research into the checkpoints that exist in a specialized form of cell division called meiosis. Those checkpoints make sure, when sexual reproduction happens, the embryo will have the correct number of chromosomes. An incorrect number can lead to genetic defects like Down syndrome or the death of the embryo. Thirty percent of human miscarriages are attributed to an embryo having an incorrect number of chromosomes.</p>
<p>Wielding a worm pick and peering through a microscope, Ashley often can be found in the lab working late into the night.</p>
<p>Research &#8220;makes you more analytical,&#8221; says Ashley, who won a $2,500 grant to fund her summer work in the lab. &#8220;It makes you think more about everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>For her part, Bhalla believes students in the classroom are often told how something works but are usually not given information about how that understanding came about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Undergraduate research exposes students to how we actually gain scientific knowledge,&#8221; she says.</p>

Karen passed away peacefully at home surrounded by loved ones on Tuesday, July 28, after a brave fight against pancreatic cancer.<br/>
<br/>
 Karen was a vibrant woman who helped transform University House into a hub of social and intellectual engagement for the campus and the community. Shortly after her arrival on campus in 1981, Karen joined the Historical Society, the UCSC Women's Club, and the Cultural Council.<br/>
<br/>
 But she will likely be best remembered for her passionate support of theater, her partnership with Theater Arts Professor Emerita Audrey Stanley, and her role as founding board president of Shakespeare Santa Cruz. To this day, the Stanley-Sinsheimer Glen bears her name as a lasting tribute to her advocacy.<br/>
<br/>
 Karen also advocated at the systemwide level for the recognition of the role and contributions of chancellor's spouses, an effort that resulted in the establishment of the title "associate of the chancellor."<br/>
<br/>
 After the Sinsheimers left UC Santa Cruz in 1987, they moved to Santa Barbara, where Karen served as the curator of photography at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art. As she always did, Karen brought her talent and energy to the endeavor and expanded the collection in significant and vital ways.<br/>
<br/>
 My wife Kelly and I have had the pleasure of getting to know Karen and Bob over the years since I became chancellor, often attending summer performances in the glen together. Just a few months ago, we had the pleasure of celebrating Bob's 95th birthday together.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A memorial service will take place in Santa Barbara at a later date; the family asks that any contributions in Karen's memory be directed to <a href="http://guides.library.ucsc.edu/speccoll/visitor-information">Special Collections</a> in McHenry Library, or to <a href="https://www.santacruzshakespeare.org/in-memory-of-karen-sinsheimer/">Santa Cruz Shakespeare</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you'll join me in taking a moment to reflect on the contributions of this visionary and vivacious woman. Kelly and I extend our condolences to Bob, the family, and the many people on and off campus who had the good fortune to call Karen a friend.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.independent.com/news/2015/jul/31/karen-sinsheimer-dies/</url><title>Santa Barbara Independent obituary</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.noozhawk.com/article/a_tribute_to_karen_sinsheimer_santa_barbara_museum_of_art_curator_of_photog</url><title>Tribute from the Santa Barbara Museum of Art</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e60baf39807270171b1d43903959e32e"><name>braga-peabody-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz alumnus Brannon Braga wins Peabody award for ‘Cosmos’</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz alumnus Brannon Braga (Film &amp; Digital Media, 1990) has received a Peabody Award for the science documentary television series, "Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey."&#13;

<p>The Peabody Awards recognize outstanding achievement in electronic media, including radio, television, and online content.</p>
<p>Braga served as executive producer and director on the show--a re-launch of <em>Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</em>, the iconic 1980 television miniseries from Carl Sagan broadcast on PBS.</p>
<p>Hosted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, the new show premiered in 2014 and has been critically praised, winning several television broadcasting awards in addition to the Peabody for educational content.</p>
<p>"I'm very proud of <em>Cosmos</em> and getting the Peabody is the cherry on top,&#8221; said Braga.&#160;&#8220;It's gratifying to have your work get recognized with such prestige."</p>
<p>Braga is perhaps best known for his work as a creator, writer and executive producer of more than 300 episodes of the <em>Star Trek</em> series.&#160;For more than 13 years collectively, he worked on <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, <em>Star Trek: Voyager,</em> and <em>Star Trek: Enterprise</em>.</p>
<p>His film credits include <em>Mission: Impossible II</em>, <em>Star Trek: Generations,</em> and <em>Star Trek: First Contact</em>.</p>
<p>Braga recently worked as executive producer and writer on <em>Terra Nova</em> along with Steven Spielberg. Prior to that, he was an executive producer and writer on the award-winning drama series <em>24</em>.</p>
<p>He is currently a writer, executive producer, and co-creator of the drama series <em>Salem</em>, WGN America&#8217;s first original scripted series, which was just renewed for a third season.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://giving.ucsc.edu/reports/2011-12/articles/arts-excellence.php</url><title>Arts Excellence—make it so</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a266bde28072704638f4f2221644674b"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1325408400000</start-date><path>/2015/07/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/07/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1420063849923</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1420063849923</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
