<a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend2015/">Alumni Weekend 2015</a> is now only two weeks away, and we are pleased to report that the RSVP numbers are the strongest we have ever seen.

Sanjayan (Ph.D. biology, '97), host of the new groundbreaking PBS nature series<i> EARTH A New Wild,</i> has been selected as the recipient of the 2015 UC Santa Cruz Alumni Achievement Award, the highest honor bestowed on a graduate of the campus.</p>
<p>The award will be presented at Sanjayan's keynote address on April 24 during <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend2015/">Alumni Weekend</a>.</p>
<p>Previous recipients include NPR science correspondent Richard Harris, Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning journalists Dana Priest and Martha Mendoza, California Secretary for Natural Resources John Laird, and Monterey Bay Aquarium Executive Director Julie Packard.</p>
<p>Sanjayan's high-profile career keeps him traveling across the globe almost constantly and places him squarely in the public eye, whether he's reporting on Bangladeshi tigers, global warming, strange weather, extinctions, rising sea levels, or mega-fires.</p>
<p>Along the way, Sanjayan, who was born in Sri Lanka, was hailed as an advocate for diversity&#8212;in all its forms&#8212;in a <i>Time </i>magazine article entitled "Changing the White Face of the Green Movement."</p>
<p>"I can't think of anyone more fitting to receive this award at this moment," UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal said in a message to Sanjayan, referring to his life as a working scientist, public intellectual, and environmental advocate.</p>
<p>Sanjayan, executive vice president and senior scientist for Conservation International, has just returned from a global journey for his new five-part series, which debuted February 4 and features unusual and moving "partnerships" between human beings and ecosystems.</p>
<p>"I am deeply touched by this honor," said Sanjayan, whose Alumni Weekend keynote, entitled, "<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2691">A New Wild: Saving Nature in a Human-Dominated World</a>," will take place on Friday, April 24, at 7:30 p.m. at Performing Arts M110 in the campus's Media Theater. "My time at (UC Santa Cruz) probably did more to prepare me for my future career than any time I have spent previously or since. All the key skills I have today I first practiced during my six years in graduate school."</p>
<p>His new program explores how humans are inextricably woven into every aspect of the planet's natural systems. With 45 shoots in 29 different countries, the show took Sanjayan from a preserve in India, land of the wild tiger, to the wilds of Montana, where he observed a specially trained group of cowboys who are helping ecosystems recover with their ranching practices.</p>
<p>"The area is being filled with birds, including some that are just on the edge of being put on the endangered species list," Sanjayan said in an <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/04/rev-spring-13-alumni-profile-sanjayan.html">interview</a> with <i>UC Santa Cruz</i> <i>Review </i>magazine. "They have wolves, elk, pronghorn&#8212;a fairly intact ecosystem.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that there is massive environmental destruction being wrought upon this planet," he continued. "But there are also amazing people doing amazing things."</p>
<p>Until recently, Sanjayan served as the lead scientist for The Nature Conservancy, where he spent 16 years specializing in development and conservation strategies, focusing on Africa, wildlife ecology, and media outreach.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz played a decisive role in his present career. Though he admits that he is "not one of those people who loves being on television," he comes across as confident and very much in the know&#8212;two traits he attributes in large part to his graduate school experience here.</p>
<p>"While I was at UC Santa Cruz I didn't think much about conservation," he said. "I mostly thought about taking on difficult questions."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7bd984a8807270172dad5822afe56a53"><name>Anzaldua-feminist-conference</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz conference to honor visionary feminist philosopher Gloria Anzaldúa </title><summary>The UC Presidential Chair in Feminist Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies will present a conference on the work of feminist philosopher and writer Gloria Anzaldua, April 10-11, at the Humanities Complex on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, feminist studies, Gloria Anzaldua, women's studies</keywords><start-date>1428008400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz conference to honor late visionary feminist Gloria Anzaldúa </display-name><path>/2015/04/Anzaldua-feminist-conference</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/Anzaldua-feminist-conference</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1428006995056</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1428009456262</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Feminist Studies</value><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/Anzaldua-poster-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/Anzaldua-poster-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Anzaldua-poster-350.jpg</name><display-name>Anzaldúa-poster-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>168418</file-size><width>350</width><height>541</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz Gloria Anzaldúa conference poster</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/Anzaldua-thumb1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/Anzaldua-thumb1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Anzaldua-thumb1.jpg</name><display-name>Anzaldua-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>11211</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa Cruz Gloria Anzaldúa conference poster</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/Anzaldua-ocean-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/Anzaldua-ocean-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Anzaldua-ocean-200.jpg</name><display-name>Anzaldúa-ocean-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>71030</file-size><width>200</width><height>319</height></image><image-alt>Gloria Anzaldúa</image-alt><image-caption>Gloria Anzald&#250;a</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/08/presidential-chair.html"><em><strong>The UC Presidential Chair in Feminist Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies</strong></em></a> will present a conference on the work of feminist philosopher and writer Gloria Anzald&#250;a, April 10-11, at the Humanities Complex on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</p>
<p>The conference is the culmination of a series of undergraduate workshops and creative writing seminars, advanced study seminars for graduate students and faculty, and performances by artists and poets honoring<b> </b>Anzald&#250;a this year as part of the campus&#8217;s <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/events.html"><b><i>50th<sup> </sup>anniversary celebration</i></b></a>.</p>
<p>Titled <i>The Feminist Architecture of Gloria E. Anzald&#250;a: New Translations, Crossings, and Pedagogies in Anzald&#250;an Thought</i><b>, </b>the two-day scholarly event is free and open to the public.<i> </i></p>
<p>Anzald&#250;a was a lecturer in the Women's Studies Department at UC Santa Cruz (now Feminist Studies), where she influenced a generation of students, offering such courses as <i>Autohistorias</i> and <i>Women of Color in the United States</i>, before her untimely death in 2004.</p>
<p>Anzald&#250;a was also a graduate student in literature at UCSC and had nearly completed her Ph.D. at the time of her death; she was awarded her Ph.D. posthumously.</p>
<p>Anzald&#250;a drew inspiration from an array of altars she created in her home near Lighthouse Point. The altars form the heart of her archives, which now reside in McHenry Library&#8217;s Special Collections.&#160;</p>
<p>She is the author of <i>Borderlands: La Frontera</i> (1987)--selected as one of the &#8220;100 Best Books of the Century&#8221; by both the <i>Utne Reader</i> and <i>Hungry Mind Review</i>.&#160;</p>
<p>She also co-edited <i>This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color </i>(1981), a groundbreaking collection of essays and poems widely recognized by scholars in women&#8217;s studies as the premiere multicultural feminist text.</p>
<p>Anzald&#250;a&#8217;s other published works include the anthologies <i>Making Face, Making Soul/Haciendo Caras</i> (1990), <i>This Bridge We Call Home: Radical Visions for Transformation</i> (2002), <i>The Gloria Anzald&#250;a Reader </i>(2009), as well as several children&#8217;s books.</p>
<p>Anzald&#250;a&#8217;s numerous honors include a fiction award from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Before Columbus Foundation American Book Award, the Lamda Lesbian Small Book Press Award, the Susan Koppelman Award, the Smithsonian Notable Book Award, and the Am&#233;ricas Honor Award.</p>

The event is free and open to the public. <br/><br/>Speaking will be Amina Wadud, an African American scholar of gender and Islam, and an expert in interpreting the Quran. Her latest book,<em> Inside the Gender Jihad: Women&#8217;s Reform in Islam</em>, (Oneworld Publications, 2006) includes extensive details about her experiences as a Muslim, wife, mother, sister, scholar, and activist.<br/><br/>Feminism and Islam are not widely considered together. Wadud has long specialized in both. She will provide a critical reading of Muslim women's reform movements that emphasizes the historical evolution and distinctions of three major perspectives: secular Muslim women, Islamist women, and the rise of Islamic feminists.<br/><br/>In particular, she will discuss her experiences as a resource scholar with Musawah, a global movement for reform in Muslim family law.<br/><br/>Wadud&#8217;s father was a Methodist minister when she was born in Baltimore. She converted to Islam in 1972 during college and officially changed her name from Mary Teasley two years later. <br/><br/>She received a B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania and later earned a M.A. in Near Eastern Studies, and a Ph.D. in Arabic and Islamic Studies at the University of Michigan. She studied in Egypt during graduate school, including the American University in Cairo, Cairo University, and Al-Azhar University.<br/><br/>Wadud has taught at the Islamic University of Malaysia, the Virginia Commonwealth University, and the Gadjah Mada University of Indonesia. Her first book, <em>Qur'an and Woman: Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman's Perspective</em> was published in 1999.<br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8fc5426d807270173df029587dab58d9"><name>deer-fawning</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>It's deer fawning season, keep your distance, let them be</title><summary>Please be aware that spring is the prime birthing season for a wide variety of campus wildlife, including deer.</summary><start-date>1428390000000</start-date><display-name>Deer fawning season alert</display-name><path>/2015/04/deer-fawning</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/deer-fawning</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1428341211699</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1428446252545</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/deer-fawning.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/deer-fawning.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>deer-fawning.jpg</name><display-name>4633444462_b89d33e287_z.jpg</display-name><file-size>62512</file-size><width>380</width><height>297</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>A fawn's best chance of survival lies in being raised by its mother.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Please be aware that spring is the prime birthing season for a wide variety of campus wildlife, including deer.</p>
<p>Finding a fawn (baby deer) alone in the woods or a meadow is fairly common. Many people assume that young wildlife found alone are abandoned, helpless and need assistance for their survival. In nearly all cases this is a mistake, and typically human interaction does more damage than good. If you see a fawn or other newborn wildlife, enjoy your encounter, but for the animal&#8217;s well being, it is important to keep the encounter brief and maintain some distance.</p>
<p>A fawn's best chance of survival lies in being raised by its mother. Fawns nurse three to four times a day, usually for less than thirty minutes at a time, but otherwise the doe keeps her distance. This helps reduce the chances that she will attract a predator to the fawn. The fawn's protective coloration, near lack of scent and ability to remain motionless all help it avoid detection by predators and people.</p>
<p>If you find a fawn you should not approach it and by no means touch it or pick it up. The mother will most likely return to claim it. If you feel that the animal is in harms way, maintain a substantial distance while still being able to observe it and contact the <b>campus police department 459-2231</b> or <b>county </b><b>Animal Control: <a href="tel:831-454-7227" target="_blank" value="+18314547227">831-454-7227</a>.</b></p>
<p>In addition to potentially harming a fawn, state and federal laws forbid possession of game and many non-game animals, so adopting newborn wildlife is usually illegal. If a fawn has been "rescued" when it shouldn't have been, it can often be released at the same location. Parents tend to remain in the area for at least a day, looking for the lost youngster.</p>

Sadly, it has been closed since 2006. Now, thanks to generous donations from alumni and a truly <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/03/quarry-student-support.html">monumental financial contribution</a> from students, we stand on the verge of being able to reopen the Quarry Amphitheater.</p>
<p>&#160;Let me share the history of this campus landmark and update you on efforts to restore and reopen it. More than 50 years ago, when the University of California selected our site for its next campus, the quarry was highlighted as a natural feature that could be converted into a facility for events. Award-winning landscape architect Robert Royston designed the space, creating a one-of-a-kind gathering spot near the center of campus.</p>
<p>For decades, the Quarry Amphitheater was the scene of commencements, convocations, concerts, celebrations, cultural events, and even classes. Alfred Hitchcock, Angela Davis, Leon Panetta, Bella Abzug, Ravi Shankar, and Buckminster Fuller all spoke at the quarry. It has served as a place of solace in times of crisis, following events such as Tiananmen Square and September 11. Professors taught classes there, musicians practiced their instruments, and many simply sought out the space for a quiet conversation or a moment of stillness.</p>
<p>The Quarry Amphitheater still sits in the center of campus, but it hasn&#8217;t seen a crowd since 2006, when it was officially closed. The amphitheater is in dire need of repair and restoration. We need to stabilize the rock walls, revamp the seating, install conduits and lighting, and make it ADA accessible. The plans will keep the spirit of the original stellar design intact.&#160;</p>
<p>We have made reopening the quarry a campus fundraising priority, and thanks to the generosity of our students and donors, we are about 75 percent of the way toward our goal. We are closer than ever to being able to bring the quarry back to life; if we can raise the remaining funds, work can start next spring.</p>
<p>Imagine sitting outside on a bench in the evening, watching a student dance performance, or bringing your sunhat to an outdoor lecture by a world-renowned scholar. For UCSC alumni, memories like that are a part of what made UC Santa Cruz such a fabulous place. And we are close to making such memories possible again.</p>

Scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, isolated bacteria that strongly inhibited the growth of the white-nose syndrome fungus in laboratory tests.</p>
<p>Experiments are now in progress to see if treating bats with the bacteria can protect them from the disease, said Joseph Hoyt, a UC Santa Cruz graduate student who led the study. "We are analyzing data from tests on live bats now, and if the results are positive, the next step would be a small field trial," he said.</p>
<p>The results of the laboratory studies were published April 8 in <em>PLoS ONE</em>. Hoyt isolated bacteria from the skin of four bat species and tested the isolates for their ability to inhibit the growth of the fungus. Six bacterial isolates (all in the genus <em>Pseudomonas</em>) showed promise and were tested more extensively. All six significantly inhibited growth of the fungus, and two isolates performed especially well in suppressing fungal growth for more than 35 days.</p>
<p>"What's promising is that the bacteria that can inhibit the fungus naturally occur on the skin of bats. These bacteria may just be at too low a level to have an effect on the disease, but augmenting them to higher abundances may provide a beneficial effect," said Hoyt, who works in the lab of Marm Kilpatrick, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The researchers hope that a bacterial spray applied to bats during hibernation could suppress the fungus enough to help the bats survive the winter. The fungus that causes white-nose syndrome <em>(Pseudogymnoascus destructans)</em> grows on the exposed skin of bats' noses, ears, and wings during hibernation, when the bats' body temperatures drop. Previous research by Kilpatrick's lab has shown that the fungus can infect nearly every bat in a hibernating colony, but bats that survive the winter are able to clear the infection when they emerge from hibernation and their body temperatures rise.</p>
<p>"The potential for a treatment is exciting, because this disease is raging across the country," said Kilpatrick, a wildlife disease expert whose lab has been working with state and federal wildlife agencies and other partners to track the spread of white-nose syndrome, which was first discovered in New York state in 2006.</p>
<p>Four bat species have been hit especially hard by the disease, with some regional populations declining by more than 90 percent. One species in particular, the northern long-eared bat, appears headed toward extinction, Kilpatrick said. "Everywhere the disease has been for a couple of years, this bat is gone. We don't have any tools right now to protect this species," he said.</p>
<p>According to Hoyt, the new findings raise the possibility that naturally occurring bacteria could partially explain some of the differences seen in the impacts of the disease on different species. The isolates with the strongest inhibitory properties were cultured from a bat species that has suffered lower mortality from white-nose syndrome than other species. More research is needed, however, to determine if disease severity is related to the bacteria found on wild bats. "This study is just the first step in investigating that possibility," Hoyt said.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz researchers are part of a <a href="https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/">coordinated response</a> to white-nose syndrome involving state and federal agencies, universities, and nongovernmental organizations. Kilpatrick and coauthor Winifred Frick, assistant adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, lead the UCSC team. In addition to Hoyt, Kilpatrick, and Frick, the coauthors of the paper also include UC Santa Cruz graduate students Tina Cheng, Kate Langwig, and Mallory Hee.</p>

This revised policy is intended to be a clear statement by the University in support of copyright law and in defense of the &#8220;fair use&#8221; principle.</p>
<p>The proposed revised Policy on Copyright and Fair Use was prepared by the Systemwide Library and Scholarly Information Advisory Committee (SLASIAC) Standing Subcommittee on Copyright Policy after analyzing comments received during Systemwide Review, including comments provided by the Academic Council. Based on these comments, the revised draft policy includes a statement to the effect that the University will defend employees who reproduce copyrighted materials in the good faith belief that they are doing so in compliance with the law, and it articulates more explicitly the University&#8217;s responsibility to provide support for the faculty&#8217;s copyright concerns.</p>
<p>Final Review is intended to advise as to the results of the Systemwide Review and how language has been refined; substantive revisions during Final Review are not anticipated.&#160; The proposed revised Policy on Copyright and Fair Use and background materials are available online at:&#160; <a href="http://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/sscp/resources">http://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/sscp/resources</a>.</p>

<p>A month full of activities, performances, discussions, and films is scheduled for April designated Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM) on campuses and communities across the country.</p>
<p>The events at UC Santa Cruz and in the Santa Cruz community are part of a nationwide effort to build awareness of sexual assault, dating violence and gender-based violence.</p>
<p><strong>Friday, April 10</strong>, the film &#8220;The Hunting Ground&#8221; will be shown at the Nickelodean Theater in Santa Cruz, followed by a question and answer panel with representatives of law enforcement, victims advocates, activists, and UC Santa Cruz officials from the campus student conduct and Title IX offices. &#160;Santa Cruz police victim&#8217;s advocate Julie Schneider will moderate.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a great example of campus and community collaboration,&#8221; said Tracey Tsugawa, &#160;Title IX officer at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;It&#8217;s important that we raise awareness on these critical issues that our communities face.&#8221; Tsugawa&#8217;s office oversees the UC Santa Cruz effort to educate about, prevent, and investigate cases of sexual assault or gender-based violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hunting Ground&#8221; is a documentary that takes a critical look at how some universities across the country have reacted to cases of sexual assault. It is one of several recent high-profile subjects that have raised public consciousness to campus sexual violence.</p>
<p>Sexual Assault Awareness Month comes as the University of California system implements a series of recommendations from the President&#8217;s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault convened last year.</p>
<p>At UCSC, a new campus wide Coordinated Community Review Team for Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Sexual Misconduct met for the first time last week.</p>
<p>T<strong>he week of April 19-25</strong> has been designated &#8220;Consent Week&#8221; on the UC Santa Cruz campus. Other SAAM activities on campus include joining a national day of action with &#160;&#8220;Carry that Weight&#8221; Monday, April 13 at Quarry Plaza. Students, staff, and faculty plan to stand in solidarity with survivors of sexual and domestic violence by carrying mattresses together, an action taken by a Columbia University student who said the university failed to adequately address her charges of sexual assault.</p>
<p>The events are being coordinated by the UCSC offices of SAFE, Sexual Assault Facts and Education, and SHOP, Student Health Outreach and Promotion.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, April 21</strong>, a workshop on &#8220;Violence in the Queer Community&#8221; is set for 7 p.m. at the Village Classroom.</p>
<p>The next day, <strong>Wednesday, April 22</strong>, Tsugawa, the campus Title IX officer, plans to meet with students and others for &#8220;Title IX and Dine&#8221; at 6 p.m.&#160; at the Student Health Center Mural Room.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday, April 23</strong>, at 8 p.m. Laci Green, a blogger, sex education educator and activist, will visit campus to speak on &#8220;Taking Down Rape Culture&#8221; at the College Nine/Ten multipurpose room.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, April 25</strong>, from 9:30 a.m. to noon, UCSC will partner with Monarch Services (<a href="http://www.monarchscc.org">www.monarchscc.org</a>) to host "Walk a Mile in Her Shoes." The event wil help raise awareness of sexual assault by encouraging community members to literally walk one mile wearing women's high heels.&#160; Details about the event and registration can be found at: <a href="http://wam2015.monarchscc.org/">http://wam2015.monarchscc.org/</a></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2015/04/uc-recognizes-national-sexual-assault-awareness-month-with-activities-systemwide.html</url><title>UC recognizes national Sexual Assault Awareness Month </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/uc-meets-milestones.html</url><title>Initial implementations of UC President Napolitano's Task Force</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9597c915807270173df02958ebe738a4"><name>arboretum-spring-sale</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Arboretum holds Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, April 18</title><summary>Celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, the Arboretum offers colorful, drought-tolerant plants for California gardens.</summary><keywords>Arboretum, UCSC Arboretum, UC Santa Cruz Arboretum, Spring Plant Sale</keywords><start-date>1428390000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz Arboretum holds Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, April 18</display-name><path>/2015/04/arboretum-spring-sale</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/arboretum-spring-sale</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1428438894833</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1428442519212</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Stephen McCabe</name><title></title><phone/><email>smccabe@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/telopea-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/telopea-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>telopea-400.jpg</name><display-name>telopea-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>75057</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>Telopea flower</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/telopea-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/telopea-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>telopea-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>telopea-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>28439</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Telopea flower</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><i>Telopea</i> 'Fireball' (Photo by S.

<p>Now in its 50th anniversary year, the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum has a long history of bringing new plants to local gardeners. Over the years, several of its introductions have been among the "Best New Plants" heralded by <i>Sunset</i> magazine. Plants now familiar to some central coast gardeners--such as proteas, pincushion proteas, grevilleas, banksias, and some manzanitas--were not nearly as widely grown when the Arboretum first started selling them years ago.</p>
<p>The Arboretum's annual sale is held in conjunction with the spring plant sale of the California Native Plant Society (CNPS). Both sales are open early (from 10 a.m. to noon) to members of the Arboretum and CNPS, and to the general public from noon to 4 p.m. Memberships will be on sale at the gate.</p>
<p>The Spring Plant Sale offers colorful, drought-tolerant plants for California gardens. The Arboretum has brought to market many plants that can help local gardeners cope with the current long drought. Going forward, the Arboretum will continue to focus on sustainability through plants that use little water and fertilizer, with a growing emphasis on California natives and succulents.</p>
<p>"Over the last 40 years, I have found the Arboretum to be one of the most beautiful, exciting, and inspirational places to see and acquire plants from and for mediterranean climate regions like our own," said Jeff Rosendale, owner of Sierra Azul Nursery.</p>
<p>This year's sale highlights old favorites as well as choice plants that may soon be popular. The California native <i>Arctostaphylos pumila</i>, a Monterey Bay endemic manzanita, is among the featured plants this year. Others include the water-wise <i>Banksia ericifolia</i> 'Fireworks', <i>Boronia heterophylla, Darwinia citriodora</i> 'Seaspray', and <i>Hakea salicifolia</i> 'Gold Medal'. In limited quantities, the popular <i>Telopea</i> 'Fireball' will also be available, as well as the deep blue <i>Lechenaultia biloba</i> 'Ray's Moora'.</p>
<p>For more information, contact the UCSC Arboretum at (831) 502-2998 or visit <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu/">arboretum.ucsc.edu</a>. The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>04-19-2015</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9ab8d5e8807270173df029587d2f59b5"><name>sullivan-neh-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Egyptologist awarded NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant </title><summary>Assistant professor of history Elaine Sullivan has received a Digital Start-Up Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to develop a three-dimensional model and virtual tour that will demonstrate how an ancient Egyptian site evolved over more than 3,000 years.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, elaine sullivan, digital humanities, UC Santa Cruz Humanities Division, digital humanities news, ucsc history department</keywords><start-date>1428526200000</start-date><display-name>Egyptologist awarded NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant </display-name><path>/2015/04/sullivan-neh-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/sullivan-neh-grant</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1428524946889</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1428526312624</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/Elaine-sullivan-325.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/Elaine-sullivan-325.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Elaine-sullivan-325.jpg</name><display-name>Elaine-sullivan-325.jpg</display-name><file-size>146759</file-size><width>325</width><height>325</height></image><image-alt>Elaine Sullivan, UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of History</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/sullivan-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/sullivan-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sullivan-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sullivan-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>28139</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Elaine Sullivan, UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of History</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Elaine Sullivan</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Assistant professor of history Elaine Sullivan has received a Digital Start-Up Grant from the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/about%20"><em><strong>National Endowment for the Humanities</strong></em></a> to develop a three-dimensional model and virtual tour that will demonstrate how an ancient Egyptian site evolved over more than 3,000 years.</p>
<p>The $47,200 grant is one of 17 awards directed to development of new digital tools for study of the humanities that are part of a larger slate of 232 grants just announced by the NEH.</p>
<p>Sullivan is co-principal investigator of a Digital Humanities Research Cluster funded by the <a href="http://ihr.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>Institute for Humanities Research</strong></em></a> (IHR) at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"I think of digital humanities as using new technologies to answer questions I can&#8217;t answer now--opening up new realms of scholarship,&#8221; said Sullivan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to be part of this working group,&#8221; she added.&#160; &#8220;We all do incredibly different things, but we all see commonalities in the ways we can be creative in using these new technologies. I think people are interested in pushing the boundaries of digital scholarship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sullivan joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2013. Her field experience in Egypt includes five seasons of excavation with Johns Hopkins University at the temple of the goddess Mut (Luxor), as well as four&#160;seasons in the field with a UCLA project in the Egyptian Fayum, at the Greco-Roman town of Karanis.</p>
<p>She received her M.A. and Ph.D. in Egyptian art and archaeology from Johns Hopkins University, and her B.A. in history from Duke University.</p>
<p>Sullivan&#8217;s project, titled <em>3D Saqqara</em>, integrates Geographic Information Systems (GIS)--one of the prevalent formats for data organization in modern archaeology&#8212;with 3D modeling to re-create the ancient Egyptian cemetery at Saqqara. But Sullivan noted it will also add a fully 4D study of the archaeological site across space and time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hoping to finish construction of the model with this grant&#8221; said Sullivan. &#8220;The next step is to publish the model and stimulate access to it. The goal is to be creating resources that will be accessible to researchers, students, and the general public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Irena Poli&#263;, associate director of the IHR, noted that Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants from the NEH provide essential support for the planning stages of innovative projects that promise to benefit the humanities.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Digital Humanities Research Cluster has done a tremendous job on jumpstarting a conversation about digital scholarship on our campus,&#8221; said Poli&#263;.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to have received this grant and look forward to working with Elaine on the next steps,&#8221; she added. <br/><br/><br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9f41eb09807270173df029586c854b19"><name>canra-policy-revision</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Revisions to UC CANRA policy and updates to UC Santa Cruz CANRA website and materials</title><summary>In order to comply with California State Assembly Bill 1775 (AB 1775), which went into effect on January 1, 2015, the UC Office of the President revised the UC Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act (CANRA) Policy, effective March 17, 2015, to reflect the new legislation. </summary><start-date>1428562800000</start-date><display-name>Revisions to UC CANRA Policy </display-name><path>/2015/04/canra-policy-revision</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/canra-policy-revision</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1428601039581</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1428602894251</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In order to comply with California State Assembly Bill 1775 (AB 1775), which went into effect on January 1, 2015, the UC Office of the President revised the UC Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act (CANRA) Policy, effective March 17, 2015, to reflect the new legislation. State Assembly Bill 1775 updated the definition of &#8220;sexual exploitation&#8221; as it applies to the CANRA, specifically section 11165.1 of the Act. The definition of sexual exploitation now includes &#8220;a person who knowingly downloads, streams, or accesses through any electronic or digital media, a film, photograph, videotape, video recording, negative, or slide in which a child is engaged in an act of obscene sexual conduct.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>As a manager or supervisor, you are responsible for identifying Mandated Reporters within the employees that you supervise.

<p>Shapiro is a leading authority on ancient DNA--how to recover it from fossils, museum specimens, and prehistoric remains buried in frozen tundra, and how to analyze it for clues to the evolutionary history of species and populations, both living and extinct. She has studied DNA from ancient populations of bears, horses, humans, and, yes, mammoths. But she is not a big proponent of "de-extinction"--the idea that scientists could use ancient DNA to recreate extinct species.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10415.html"><i>How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction</i></a> (Princeton University Press, May 2015), Shapiro addresses the scientific and ethical challenges that would confront any effort to bring back extinct creatures.</p>
<p>"I question if it's something we should do at all, for many ethical and environmental reasons," Shapiro said. "I'm trying to separate the science from the science fiction, because too much of what people hear is science fiction. In a field that's so full of hyperbole, people should be armed with the facts so they can make informed decisions."</p>
<p>As for "cloning" a mammoth, that would mean creating an animal with a complete mammoth genome, mammoth chromosomes, and mammoth cells. It's not possible because scientists have only been able to recover fragments of DNA from frozen mammoth remains. What is plausible, and what some scientists have proposed doing, is to insert mammoth genes into the elephant genome to create an elephant with traits that would enable it to live in the Arctic, such as thick hair and cold-resistant blood. But what's the point?</p>
<p>"If the point is to put it in a zoo, then we should probably stop right now," Shapiro said. "If the point is to restore diversity to preserve an ecosystem that doesn't function well without a certain animal, then maybe it's worth considering."</p>
<p>Mammoths, for example, may have played an important role in Arctic ecosystems, helping to maintain frozen tundra through their grazing and trampling. But there are still serious ethical issues to consider before embarking on the creation of such a dramatically modified animal (which may not be a clone, but would probably always be called that in the popular media).</p>
<p>In <i>How to Clone a Mammoth</i>, Shapiro provides detailed descriptions of current state-of-the-art bioengineering technologies, explaining just what can and cannot be done. She also provides a thorough discussion of the ethical and environmental issues raised by de-extinction proposals. Readers of the book will be well equipped to develop their own informed opinions on this controversial topic.</p>

<div>The university anticipates a small number of union representatives to engage in a peaceful picket near the UC Santa Cruz Student Health Center, potentially slowing pedestrian or vehicle traffic in the crosswalks closest to the building. No other concerted activities, including picketing near the main entrance, are expected at this time.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Student Health Center will remain open during the strike, and we are making preparations to minimize disruption to patient care.

The campus is one of several University of California campuses now under review by the OCR. <br/><br/>Sexual assault on college campuses is a critical issue and one the campus takes seriously. We're proud that UC Santa Cruz has long been at the forefront of campus sexual violence <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/04/sexual-assault-awareness.html">prevention and education programs</a>. Still, there is always room for improvement. We will, of course, cooperate fully with the investigation, and we will refine our policies and procedures as necessary. <br/><br/>As part of UC President Janet Napolitano's initiative on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault, UC Santa Cruz recently updated its sexual assault policy and the campus <a href="http://safe.ucsc.edu/">website</a>. We hired a new confidential victim advocate and are in the process of recruiting a second advocate. The campus has taken these and other steps to bolster our ability to respond to reports of sexual violence and harassment, and we will are prepared to do more if warranted.<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz is committed to preventing sexual violence&#8212;including sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking&#8212;and to responding promptly and appropriately to such reports. Creating and maintaining a safe campus environment for everyone is one of our top priorities.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a5084cc9807270173df02958cd657d17"><name>proposed-taps-increases</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Proposed increases to parking fees and program fares</title><summary>Consistent with the campus review and approval process, this message is to notify the campus community of a proposal to increase parking fees and to solicit feedback. </summary><start-date>1428649200000</start-date><display-name>Proposed increases to parking fees and program fares</display-name><path>/2015/04/proposed-taps-increases</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/proposed-taps-increases</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1428697926820</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1428697926820</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Consistent with the campus review&#160;and approval process, this message is to notify the campus community&#160;of a proposal to increase parking fees and to&#160;solicit feedback. Transportation&#160;and Parking Services (TAPS) is proposing annual increases to&#160;most parking fees and program fares over a three-year period&#160;starting&#160;July 2015 and continuing through June 2018.<br/> &#160;<br/> Most parking fees have not increased since&#160;July 2006, although vanpool fares and the faculty/staff bus pass&#160;price increased this year. The proposal aims to&#160;increase the&#160;proportion of revenues generated by parkers who purchase temporary&#160;permits or use pay stations and meters; however, nearly all parking&#160;fees&#160;will be affected.<br/> &#160;<br/> If approved:<br/> &#183; &#160;annual&#160;A permits will increase $36 each year (from the current $792 to $828,&#160;$864, and $900, respectively);<br/> &#183;&#160; daily&#160;A permits will increase from the current $6 to $8 the first year, and&#160;to $10 in July 2017;<br/> &#183;&#160; academic&#160;R permits will increase from the current $474/year to $519, $570, and&#160;$594;<br/> &#183;&#160; the&#160;hourly rate at meters and paystations will increase from the current $1.50&#160;to $2.00, $2.25, and $2.50 over the next three years; and<br/> &#183;&#160; the&#160;flat rate at paystations (after 4:30 p.m. and on weekends) will increase from&#160;the current $3 to $4 in July 2015 and to $5 in July 2017.<br/> &#160;<br/> In addition, carpool permits will be&#160;restricted to groups of three or more participants per permit. Pairs&#160;of individuals may still purchase A permits with the costs&#160;divided&#160;equally between them, but will not be eligible to purchase an A&#160;carpool permit (or park in spaces reserved for carpool permit&#160;holders). The&#160;<a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/taps-fees-proposal-news-article.html">full&#160;proposal&#160;is available online</a>&#160;at the TAPS website.<br/> &#160;<br/> The proposed increases will&#160;generate revenues needed to fund operations, maintain parking-subsidized sustainable&#160;transportation programs, and acquire&#160;new technology to improve reliability&#160;and efficiency. These revenues are also needed to build a reserve fund to&#160;support future capital construction and&#160;operating needs. TAPS&#160;is supported solely by user fees because it&#8217;s an&#160;auxiliary enterprise. In the years since the last parking fee&#160;increase, annual parking&#160;revenues have declined 7 percent &#8212; in part&#160;due to the success of alternative transportation options. At the same&#160;time, operating costs (including salaries and&#160;benefits, fuel, regulatory compliance,&#160;and maintenance) have all continued to increase.<br/> &#160;<br/> As part of the approval process for&#160;this proposal, campus affiliates are invited to submit comments&#160;to&#160;<a href="mailto:tapsfeecomments-group@ucsc.edu">tapsfeecomments-group@ucsc.edu</a>&#160;between&#160;April 10&#160;and May 26, 2015. TAPS&#160;will summarize the comments and forward them to Chancellor George&#160;Blumenthal. The chancellor may either proceed with approval&#160;of the&#160;fee proposal increase and implementation, or he may return it to TAPS&#160;for modification. If approved by the chancellor and executive vice&#160;chancellor/campus provost, the final fee increases would take effect July&#160;2015 or soon thereafter.<br/>

their findings</article-subhead><article-text><p>Expect&#160;a day&#160;of unexpected convergences, wild ideas, and surprising discoveries at TEDxSantaCruz 2015: Radical Collaboration, a time to explore interdisciplinary learning and across-the-lanes thinking.</p>
<p>The&#160;<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2774">all-day event</a>, which starts at 9 a.m. on&#160;April 24&#160;at the Rio Theatre, will feature a line-up of speakers from a wide variety of disciplines challenging themselves, casting aside their differences, and sharing their findings with the audience. General admission is $70. The cost for UC Santa Cruz students is $35.</p>
<p>The event, which is&#160;a featured&#160;part of UC Santa Cruz's 50<sup>th</sup>&#160;anniversary Alumni Weekend, is a local, self-organized version of the popular TED program that&#160;gathers leading thinkers, makers, and artists to share their innovative ideas.&#160;UC Santa Cruz is a major sponsor of&#160;the 2015 event.</p>
<p>One of the day's featured speakers is&#160;<b>David Haussler</b>, scientific director of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering.</p>
<p>His work has spawned a&#160;global&#160;cancer research project, a project to map the genome of 10,000 animal species, and programs in computer science, mathematics, microbiology, and medical research.</p>
<p>Haussler, who led the first team to map the human genome, is a brilliant example of "radical collaboration," said event co-organizer Suz Howells, UC Santa Cruz campaign operations associate. UC Santa Cruz, thanks in large part to his leadership, she said, has become "an open-source hub for scientists all over the world collaborating every day in the fight against cancer and other diseases including Ebola.</p>
<p>"The audience should also expect some surprises from <b>Bruce Damer,</b> a research associate at the UC Santa Cruz who works with professor David Deamer, chair of the Biomolecular Engineering Department. The two have brought their unique perspectives to such issues as space exploration and the origin of life on Earth.</p>
<p>Damer said their collaboration is "radical" in the sense that Deamer is a chemist by training, while Damer is a self-described "computationalist."</p>
<p>In 1985 David Deamer found that compounds extracted from an Australian meteorite form membrane-bounded compartments the size of bacterial cells. This discovery led to their collaborative studies on a proposed new scientific model of the origin of life on the Earth nearly four billion years ago. Damer noted that many of the organic building blocks of life are present in asteroids.</p>
<p>At TEDx he will describe a novel spacecraft that can retrieve small asteroids to sample them for science. Damer will also show how this same spacecraft can provide refueling stations for sustainable spaceflight in the human exploration of Mars and beyond.</p>
<p>Collaboration comes in many guises. This will be clear from listening to&#160;<b>Barbara Rogoff,&#160;</b>UC Santa Cruz distinguished professor of psychology, who studies the cultural aspects of learning and collaboration among children and spent more than three decades researching child development in the Mayan town of San Pedro in Guatemala. She has written four award-winning books, including her latest,&#160;<i>Developing Destinies: A Mayan Midwife and Town</i>.</p>
<p>Radical collaborations can take on musical forms, too. The jazz vocalist&#160;<b>Ed Reed </b>is&#160;a retired health educator who was a heroin addict for 40 years, imprisoned four times, and in dozens of treatment programs before he got into recovery. Reed received an unusual honor when online jazz critics named him a "No. 1 Rising Star" at 86 years old. He will be on hand to share his inspiring story.</p>
<p>The audience will also hear from UC Santa Cruz Games and Playable Media master's program director <b>Brenda Romero,</b> who designs games that turn some of history's most tragic lessons into interactive, emotional experiences. For decades, Romero has been a major figure in the field of game design. Famous for her work on the role-playing series <i>Wizardry,</i> she's also known for her work on <i>Def Jam: Icon, Playboy: The Mansion,</i> and <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Heroes.</i> Inspired by her daughter in 2008, she began work on her non-digital series, <i>The Mechanic Is the Message,</i> dedicated to expressing difficult subjects through interactive media. <i>Train,</i> a game derived from the events of the Holocaust, won the Vanguard Award at Indiecade in 2009.</p>

<p>Made over six years, the 88-minute film features the stunning land, sea, and wildlife of the Big Sur coast with much of the footage filmed at the UC Santa Cruz-managed Landels-Hill Big Creek natural reserve in the Santa Lucia mountains. &#160;The Wards will also show their film Saturday and Sunday April 18-19 at the Henry Miller Library in Big Sur.</p>
<p>Ward (College Eight, &#8217;80, environmental studies) said the film began as a landscape project &#8220;but after we spent some time out there we discovered some incredible wildlife behavior.&#8221; They used large-format, high-speed Red &#8220;Epic&#8221; and &#8220;Dragon&#8221; digital cameras that enabled them to capture minute behaviors and activities not detectable to the naked eye. The cameras were designed for studio use but &#8220;we decided to take them into the field,&#8221; he said. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a Wild Life&#8221; premiered at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival in February and has been selected for the International Wildlife Film Festival in Missoula, Mont. later this month and the Wildlife Conservation Film Festival in New York in October.</p>
<p>The film includes scenes of California condors, mountain lions, black bears, and bobcats, including a one-eyed female bobcat hunting seagulls on the beach with a leaping motion akin to flying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our highest moment came when you could see the condors, one (feather) at a time, make micro adjustments in their flight,&#8221; Ward said. &#160;&#8220;Biology, nature, and technology came together at one time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film also captures the early days and fledging of one of the first condor chicks to be hatched in the wild in recent times.</p>
<p>Kennan Ward studied natural history and environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz in the late 1970s as a commuter student while working as a ranger at Big Basin State Park. He worked with pioneering UC Santa Cruz natural history professors Ken Norris, Ray Dasmann, and Dick Cooley and completed independent studies that led to a joint B.A. degree in environmental studies and wildlife biology in 1980.</p>
<p>He and Karen, a San Jose State grad, met in the early 1980s, married in Yosemite in 1986, and have worked together on photographic projects around the world ever since. They&#8217;ve published numerous books in addition to thousands of photographs. When not on assignment they live in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Mark Readdie, manager of the 3,848-acre Big Creek reserve, is scheduled to introduce the Wards who will give a short introduction to the film. Feynner Arias, a Big Creek reserve steward who has lived at Big Creek for 30 years, plays the only human part in the film and will join Readdie and the Wards for a question-and-answer session afterwards.</p>

<p>The conference will be held from 1 to 6 p.m. at the George Hitchcock Lounge at Porter College. It is free and the public is invited though <a href="http://arc.ucsc.edu/news-events/events/conference-registration.html">registration is required</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Since the first studies in the 1980s, the analysis of ancient DNA from biological specimens obtained through archaeology has propelled the understanding of evolution, providing insights on how humans diverged and interacted in the past, how biology and culture co-evolved, how environmental changes impacted past ecosystems, and also how diseases evolved and spread throughout the ancient world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ancient DNA research has reached the Age of Genomics,&#8221; said conference co-organizer associate professor of anthropology J. Cameron Monroe, who leads the Archaeological Research Center (ARC). Monroe said archaeological research at UC Santa Cruz has grown dramatically, not only in anthropology, archaeology&#8217;s traditional home, but across the campus&#8217;s five academic divisions.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s conference brings together researchers from a variety of disciplines at UCSC along with others from Harvard, the University of Oklahoma, the University of Adelaide in Australia, and the Max-Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;These scientists will present a range of contributions that modern Paleogenomics has made to archaeological efforts to solve the riddles of our collective past,&#8221; Monroe said</p>
<p>Joining Monroe will be co-organizer Lars Fehren-Schmitz, assistant professor of anthropology, who heads the UC Santa Cruz Human Paleogenomics Lab. Also participating from UC Santa Cruz are Beth Shapiro, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and Richard &#8220;Ed&#8221; Green, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering.</p>
<p>Green and another conference participant, Johannes Krause, of the Max Planck Institute, were involved in extracting ancient DNA from the 40,000-year-old bones of Neanderthals and creating a draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome. Other participants have used DNA analysis to build the genomes of extinct species as old as 700,000 years, revealed the population history of prehistoric Europe, or reconstruct ancient oral and gut microbiomes that allow insights into past diets and health.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://arc.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UC Santa Cruz Archaeological Research Center  </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://arc.ucsc.edu/ARCGenetics.html</url><title>Archaeological Genetics conference website </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://arc.ucsc.edu/news-events/events/conference-registration.html</url><title>Conference registration page  </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b4a79742807270173df0295805d501a2"><name>rogers-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>When UCSC meets Silicon Valley, great things happen </title><summary>By Lynda Rogers, Dean, UCSC Silicon Valley Extension — Every day at UCSC Silicon Valley Extension, from the early morning through the late evening, the most wonderful thing happens: our students arrive.</summary><start-date>1428958800000</start-date><display-name>Lynda Rogers Keynote</display-name><path>/2015/04/rogers-keynote</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/rogers-keynote</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1428960024349</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1432074957622</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lynda Rogers </name><title>Dean of UCSC Silicon Valley Extension </title><phone/><email>lro@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/rogers-lynda-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/rogers-lynda-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rogers-lynda-350.jpg</name><display-name>rogers-lynda-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>72401</file-size><width>350</width><height>525</height></image><image-alt>Lynda Rogers - Dean of UCSC Silicon Valley Extension </image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Lynda Rogers, Dean, UCSC Silicon Valley Extension</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Every day at UCSC Silicon Valley Extension, from the early morning through the late evening, the most wonderful thing happens: our students arrive.</p>
<p>Women and men from around the world congregate in study groups, run through presentations, and prepare for class. The hubbub dies down as classes start and they disperse, taking with them their passions and ambitions. These are the professionals of Silicon Valley: the innovators, the designers, the educators, scientists and engineers; the people whose ideas could transform our future. These are the people for whom I work&#8212;and their numbers are growing.</p>
<p>UCSC Extension operates in the Venn diagram that unites the world-renowned University of California, Santa Cruz, and the fast-paced empire that is Silicon Valley. We enjoy the best of both worlds: high-caliber instructors who bring industry experience to the classroom, and UC-approved courses that reflect the latest tools and technologies in Silicon Valley and beyond.</p>
<p>We attract students like <a href="http://www.ucsc-extension.edu/student/prajakta-badhe">Prajakta Badhe</a>, who after earning a certificate in Software Engineering and Quality, landed a job with a Silicon Valley start-up she learned about at our 2014 Tech Career Fair. We&#8217;ve opened the door for professionals like <a href="http://www.ucsc-extension.edu/student/kyle-shin">Kyle Shin</a>, who after of two years of computer programming courses had launched his first app, Fite Time, in the App Store.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley tech isn&#8217;t limited to engineering. Clinical trials, regulatory affairs, and medical devices have the potential to revolutionize health care. Every industry needs project managers, as well as marketing directors, technical writers, human resource managers, and executive assistants. In 2014, we hired a research firm to generate a list of the job titles in highest demand in our region. The top three? Software engineers, marketing managers, and business analysts.</p>
<p>Guess which of our programs saw the biggest increase in enrollment over the last year? Computer Programming saw a 29 percent increase, Software Engineering and Quality grew by 26 percent, and Marketing Management saw a whopping 82 percent surge in enrollment.</p>
<p>In-demand courses match up with in-demand jobs, and Bay Area professionals know that they can find the courses they need at UCSC Extension. We see it in our numbers: We have enrolled more than 14,000 students this year, representing 30 different countries, and we expect to enroll 18,000 students by the close of the academic year. This rise in enrollment has boosted our revenues and kept us in the black.</p>
<p>UCSC Extension bridges two great ideas: UC&#8217;s longstanding tradition of rigorous academics, and Silicon Valley, the birthplace of tech, known for its &#8220;disruptive&#8221; approach to business. We couldn&#8217;t provide a better launching pad for our students.</p>
<p>They know it, too. Recently, I overheard two UCSC undergrads discussing which UC is the best.</p>
<p>"UCSC is the best campus. Why? Silicon Valley,&#8221; one said. &#8220;It's right there. If you hope to land a career in Silicon Valley, your best bet is to graduate from UCSC."</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why students gather in our building&#8212;to exchange ideas, question the status quo, and gain job skills. To all the career-changers, lifelong learners, entrepreneurs, educators, engineers, and scientists: We welcome you to Silicon Valley. Join us.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

25 with a daylong celebratory extravaganza titled <a href="http://pandanmonium.ucsc.edu"><b><i>It&#8217;s Pan-DANM-onium!</i></b></a></p>
<p>The event will feature the program's annual art exhibition--plus outdoor exhibits, interactive demos, alumni slideshows and open research labs--capped by an outdoor evening masquerade ball.</p>
<p>As part of the campus&#8217;s 2015 Alumni Weekend, DANM&#8217;s anniversary event will showcase the achievements of its alumni with a series of rapid-fire slideshow presentations.</p>
<p>More than 20 program graduates will display their current work and research from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Digital Arts Research Center (DARC, Room 230).</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s annual&#160;M.F.A. student art exhibition, titled <i>New Alchemy</i>, will be open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. at the DARC building, featuring interactive, mixed-media, and performance work by the 2015 graduating class.</p>
<p>Jaime Austin, curator and director of programs at San Jose&#8217;s ZERO1 art and technology network, and the curator of <i>New Alchemy,</i> will lead a guided tour of the student exhibition at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>DANM will additionally host a <em>Faire of Making</em> outside on the grounds of the DARC building, including a wide variety of Santa Cruz community and tech groups, featuring interactive craft booths and activities for all ages, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>During those hours, DANM research labs will also be open to the public with ongoing research on display.</p>
<p>The festival culminates in the evening with a reception for the student show from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., followed by dancing and a live DJ under the glow of projection art at the Masquerade Ball, on the DARC patio.</p>
<p><b>The <i><a href="http://danm.ucsc.edu">DANM M.F.A. Program</a></i></b> at UC Santa Cruz serves as a center for the development and study of digital media and the cultures that it has helped create. Faculty and students are drawn from a variety of backgrounds, such as the arts, computer engineering, humanities, the sciences, and social sciences, to pursue artistic and scholarly research.</p>
<p>&#8220;For 10 years now DANM has offered a model for interdisciplinary art making that has bridged the arts, humanities, and sciences,&#8221; said Acting Dean of the Arts Martin Berger. &#8220;It has inspired a generation of students and faculty to create socially conscious work at the leading edge of new media."</p>
<p>DANM director Michael Chemers noted that the program has worked hard, not merely to address the many ways in which technologies impact contemporary culture, but also to train future leaders in shaping how those forces are brought to bear in the service of enriching both culture and technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we reflect on our 10th year of existence, DANM is excited about our developing international profile, our new collaborations with other institutes across the globe, the advances of our unique research groups in inventing &#8220;outside-the-box&#8221; methods for interdisciplinary research and development, and our encouragement of art and technology projects that not only delight the mind and move the spirit, but also protect the earth and serve the struggle towards social justice,&#8221; said Chemers.</p>
<p>Admission to all events is free and open to the public.

Jones, a former personal counsel, draft speech writer, and close friend of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., will deliver a free public talk about the civil rights movement on May 4.</p>
<p>His talk, "After The Civil Rights Movement: The Legacy of Dr. King-Today and Beyond," will be at 7:30 p.m. at the UC Santa Cruz Music Center's Recital Hall. The speech will describe and interpret the legacy of King's leadership during the historic civil rights movement.</p>
<p>Jones is a diversity scholar and visiting professor at the University of San Francisco and a scholar-in-residence at the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. He is coauthor of <em>What Would Martin Say?</em> (2008) and <em>Behind the Dream - The making of the Speech that Transformed a Nation</em> (2011).</p>
<p>In a 2013 interview with NPR, Jones explained how he had to sign a $100,000 promissory note to post bail for children who were arrested after the Children's March in Birmingham in May 1963.</p>
<p>After that experience, he suggested King might use a promissory note as an analogy for his speech at the March on Washington.</p>
<p>"You know, coming here to Washington ... is like we are coming to our nation's capitol and ask[ing] to be repaid, or ask[ing] to be paid in full, on a promissory note," Jones told NPR. "Well, there has to be sufficient funds in the vaults of justice in this country."</p>
<p>Through his work in the civil rights movement, Jones has had a dramatic impact on the course of American history. He coordinated the legal defense of King and the other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference against the libel suits filed against them and the New York Times. He also he drafted the settlement agreement between Birmingham and King to bring about the end of demonstrations and the desegregation of department stores and public accommodations.</p>
<p>In 1967, Jones became the first African American partner in a Wall Street investment banking firm. He has founded successful financial, corporate, and media-related ventures and has twice been recognized in Fortune magazine.</p>
<p>The event is sponsored by the Office of the Chancellor, the Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Equal Justice Society.</p>
<p>Complimentary parking will be provided in the Performing Arts parking lot for lecture attendees.

The annual gathering may involve a large number of individuals in or near the Porter Meadow smoking marijuana. The greatest impact is expected between 3 and 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Obviously, a large-scale event based on the consumption of marijuana has the potential to impact campus safety. The fact that this event attracts many unaffiliated people to our campus adds to my concerns. I ask for your help in discouraging non-affiliates, including students from other UC campuses, from attending.</p>
<p>Among the unaffiliated people that UC Santa Cruz officers have contacted at this event in recent years were parents with young children, vendors operating without a permit, and people interested in selling marijuana and other illegal drugs on campus. For example, last year we arrested a Watsonville resident for carrying a 19-inch machete. Also, several individuals had to be treated for hallucination and sickness from ingesting "edibles," such as cookies and brownies, laced with marijuana and other substances. At least one individual was hospitalized.</p>
<p>Recently, UC Santa Cruz Police have responded to several drug and alcohol poisonings and overdoses in the colleges involving students and non-affiliated individuals.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Police and local law enforcement will be present again this year, with a priority of addressing public safety and providing emergency response. Police officers will conduct enhanced patrols throughout the day, looking for individuals in possession of and/or using marijuana and alcohol or other drugs; drivers under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol; and will enforce unpermitted vending of any merchandise, food or medical marijuana on the campus.</p>
<p>Please respect the rights of others. <b>This unsanctioned event significantly burdens the operations of the campus. It threatens the health and safety of the community, imposes unnecessary expenses and taints the reputation of UC Santa Cruz, its students, staff and faculty. </b>There are also potentially serious consequences of choosing to attend. I ask that individuals consider the risks and possible penalties of coming to UC Santa Cruz this year and decide to stay away for their own safety and protection.</p>
<p>As we approach April 20, I want to share additional information that may be helpful to campus safety that afternoon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please remember that all members and guests of the UC Santa Cruz community are expected to comply with university policy and federal and state laws. The sale, furnishing or distribution of marijuana and other illegal drugs are felony crimes. Most misdemeanors, such as public intoxication, along with felonies, will mean spending at least one night in the Santa Cruz County Jail. At a minimum, those smoking or in possession of marijuana may receive a citation resulting in at least a $100 fine. Students who are arrested or receive citations may also receive sanctions by the Student Conduct Office.</li>
<li>Live or pre-recorded amplified music is not allowed.</li>
<li>Vending of edibles for consumption, merchandise, liquids or other items is strictly prohibited.</li>
<li>Because of this expected activity, you should anticipate possible disruptions to traffic due to large groups of people, especially on the west side of campus. Campus and Metro bus service may be delayed so plan accordingly.</li>
<li>Campus parking regulations will be strictly enforced. Sections of Empire Grade will be designated as a tow-away zone, and vehicles will be ticketed and towed at the owners' expense.</li>
<li>Traffic and transit flow may be highly impacted throughout the campus, especially along Empire Grade, and on Heller Drive from the West Entrance to McLaughlin Drive. Traffic diversion measures may be instituted if needed to alleviate impacted areas. If driving a vehicle, be alert for increased pedestrian traffic on all roadways.</li>
<li>Because this activity attracts people who are unaffiliated with the campus, please make an extra effort to be aware of suspicious activity - and please don't hesitate to immediately alert UC Santa Cruz Police of such activity. If you are ever in doubt, it is always better to ask authorities to investigate, rather than risking potential harm to you or someone else. Please call 911 or 831-459-2231.</li>
<li>Those who live and work in the areas around Family Student Housing, Porter College, and College Eight are advised that smoke may remain in the area throughout the late afternoon. Those with children, respiratory problems, or other medical conditions should use precautions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Volunteers have come together to do various service projects with an emphasis on fun, community spirit, and positive impact.</p>
<p>In doing so, these community members embody the spirit of National Volunteer Week, which is dedicated to inspiring, recognizing, and encouraging people to help their communities. This year's theme is "Celebrating Service."</p>
<p>In San Francisco, volunteers have teamed up with the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank, packaging food supplies to feed hundreds of families. In the East Bay, volunteers worked with the Golden Gate Audubon Society to weed invasive plants and sow native plants that provide habitat to birds and other wildlife. In Santa Cruz, volunteers helped at the Friends of the Public Libraries Fall Book Sale.</p>
<p>Most recently, to honor the life, impact, and legacy of Cesar Chavez, alumni got together on March 28 at the Homeless Garden Project in Santa Cruz to prep beds for planting, build compost piles, and extract weeds from the garden. (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ucscbananaslugs/sets/72157651222493580/">Here are some photos from this day of volunteer work and celebration.)&#160;</a></p>
<p>It felt great to volunteer that day at the Homeless Garden Project, said Chiara Cabiglio (Merrill '11, community studies). "When people get together and give their time to worthy causes, they are part of a global movement to create positive change," she said.</p>
<p>"It is a moral obligation," continued Cabiglio, who spent her time at the garden clearing out weeds so trainees could put in seedlings. "There is a saying I've heard: 'The rent I pay for living on this Earth is volunteering and activism.&#8217;"</p>
<p>The volunteers also heard presentations by Ines Marines and Susan Drake, who both worked with Chavez.</p>
<p>Marines told the story of his life as a farm worker and how he found inspiration in Chavez's teachings of nonviolent resistance and civil rights.</p>
<p>Drake spoke of Chavez's personal attributes, noting that he would have been weeding with everyone that day.</p>

role that women played in shaping American movie culture.</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz film and digital media professor Shelley Stamp will be featured on a panel about arts biography this weekend at the 20th annual <a href="http://events.latimes.com/festivalofbooks/"><strong>Los Angeles Times Festival of Books</strong></a>--the largest public literary festival in the country.<br/><br/>Stamp will be there to discuss her new book, <em>Lois Weber in Early Hollywood,</em> just published last week by the University of California Press. <br/><br/>Stamp noted that Weber was one of the top filmmakers in early Hollywood, considered one of its "three great minds" alongside D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille. But while they have long enjoyed recognition as the "fathers" of American cinema, Weber has been mostly neglected by film historians.<br/><br/>&#8220;Her work is incredibly interesting because she wrote and directed popular narratives in the 1910s that took on controversial subjects of the day--poverty, addiction, capital punishment, and the fight to legalize birth control,&#8221; said Stamp. &#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;She believed cinema was a &#8216;voiceless language&#8217; capable of presenting these issues for a mass audience, a new medium on par with a newspaper's editorial page,&#8221; Stamp added. &#8220;In the 1920s, she continued to make films that tackled topical issues like consumer culture and new sexual mores from an increasingly feminist perspective.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;And in the late 1920s, towards the end of her career, she made a trio of films critical of Hollywood's star-driven glamour industry.&#8221;<br/><br/>Stamp said she was looking forward to the panel at the LA Times Festival of Books to share her book about Weber and add to the historical record. <br/><br/>&#8220;The festival will be an amazing opportunity to spread the word about a filmmaker who should be much better known,&#8221; said Stamp.&#160;&#8220;I have always hoped that my research would promote a better understanding about her legacy--not just among film historians, but anybody interested in Hollywood history or women's filmmaking.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;The idea that women have only recently begun making popular, profitable, and interesting films is a terrible fiction that holds back younger generations of filmmakers,&#8221; Stamp added. &#8220;So in addition to writing the book, I've also been involved in efforts to restore and preserve Weber's surviving films, to release them on DVD, and to screen them at film festivals.&#8221; <br/><br/>At the Los Angeles festival, Stamp will be participating in a panel on <strong>"Artistic Influencers"</strong> with fellow authors Mark Harris and Robert M. Dowling. Harris will be discussing his latest book <em>Five Came Back: A Story of Hollywood and the Second World War</em>, about the wartime propaganda work of filmmakers John Ford, William Wyler, John Huston, Frank Capra, and George Stevens. And Dowling will be discussing his recent book on playwright Eugene O'Neill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weber, who has often been sidelined in histories of Hollywood, deserves recognition among this esteemed group of "influencers," Stamp noted.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c3d07003807270173df02958b5d35223"><name>humanities-grad-division-leadership</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Changes in Humanities and Graduate Division leadership</title><summary>Changes this spring in the leadership of the Humanities and Graduate Divisions.</summary><start-date>1429167600000</start-date><display-name>Changes in Humanities and Graduate Division leadership</display-name><path>/2015/04/humanities-grad-division-leadership</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/humanities-grad-division-leadership</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1429214359523</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1429214359523</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We have changes this spring in the leadership of the Humanities and Graduate Divisions. </p>
<p>I am delighted to officially welcome Humanities Dean Tyler Stovall to campus. Stovall is a historian who joins us from UC Berkeley, where he was a professor of French history and dean of the Undergraduate Division of the College of Letters and Science. </p>
<p>For Tyler, this appointment, which was <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/08/humanities-dean-announcement.html">announced previously</a>, is a bit of a homecoming, as he spent 13 years as a faculty member in the UCSC Humanities Division. Please join me in welcoming him back to campus in this important capacity. </p>
<p>I also want to thank outgoing Humanities Dean Bill Ladusaw for nearly five years of dedicated and enthusiastic service as dean. Bill has served in many leadership positions at UCSC, and I will miss his wise counsel, collegiality, and good humor. I wish him well as he returns to the life of a fulltime scholar in the Linguistics Department. </p>
<p>Leadership of the Graduate Division is also changing as Vice Provost and Dean Tyrus Miller begins a sabbatical through the end of June. During his absence, Associate Dean Sue Carter will serve as dean on an acting basis.<br/> A professor of physics at UCSC since 1995, Sue joined the Graduate Division in October 2014. I appreciate her willingness to take on additional responsibilities during this period; please join me in thanking her for her service.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c99c247f807270173df029585e277aa0"><name>teach-ins-2015-aptheker-haney</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Classes without quizzes: Alumni Weekend Teach-Ins</title><summary>Returning UC Santa Cruz alumni should get ready to exercise their brains, but with no fear of final exams, at the ever-popular "Teach-Ins" featuring professors Bettina Aptheker and Craig Haney.</summary><start-date>1429310160000</start-date><display-name>teach-ins-2015-aptheker-haney</display-name><path>/2015/04/teach-ins-2015-aptheker-haney</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/teach-ins-2015-aptheker-haney</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1429311594708</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1429312861538</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Feminist Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/aptheker-bettina.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/aptheker-bettina.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aptheker-bettina.jpg</name><display-name>aptheker-bettina.jpg</display-name><file-size>8341</file-size><width>145</width><height>184</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/aptheker-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/aptheker-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aptheker-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>aptheker-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15170</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Professor Bettina Aptheker will discuss "Feminism and Social Justice."</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/haney-craig.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/haney-craig.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>haney-craig.jpg</name><display-name>haney-craig.jpg</display-name><file-size>6041</file-size><width>95</width><height>146</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Professor Craig Haney will give a presentation entitled, "Think Different: Why Everything We've Been Taught About Crime is Wrong and What We Need to Do About It."</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Alumni returning for <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend2015/">Alumni Weekend</a> should get ready to exercise their brains and have some fun at the ever-popular "Teach-Ins," an academic afternoon that lets Banana Slugs be students once again but without the exams.</p>
<p>The Teach-Ins have become a popular tradition. This year's rendition should be no exception, with respected UC Santa Cruz faculty members <strong><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2826">Bettina Aptheker,</a></strong> distinguished professor and UC Presidential Co-Chair of Feminist Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies, and this year's Faculty Research Lecturer <strong><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2825">Craig Haney</a>,</strong> an influential psychology professor whose testimony and research has changed the way thousands of Americans look at solitary confinement.</p>
<p>These Teach-Ins, both free of charge, take place at 2:30-3:45 p.m. on April 25 in Stevenson classrooms on the UC Santa Cruz campus. They are part of a very special edition of <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend2015/events.html">UC Santa Cruz's Alumni Weekend</a>, marking the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the campus opening its doors to students.</p>
<p>Aptheker will deliver a presentation called "Feminism and Social Justice." She promises to give attendants food for thought about current movements in social justice and the ways in which gender, race, class, and sexuality interconnect with each other.</p>
<p>Aptheker said she's very excited to share her work with alumni. "Feminist Studies is such a vibrant stand-alone graduate program at UC Santa Cruz," said Aptheker, who also teaches an Intro to Feminism course for undergraduates. "It feels great to be able to spread the word about it."</p>
<p>She also looks forward to saying hello to former students. Aptheker has gained such a large and loyal following over the years that she runs into people who have taken her class since she stared teaching at UC Santa Cruz in 1980.</p>
<p>"I run into people in the oddest places&#8212;in airports, in a parking lot in a very remote area of Colorado, and, not so very long ago, on the New York City subway," Aptheker said. Aptheker's research covers such issues as feminist oral history and memoir, feminist pedagogy, African American feminist history, sexuality/queer studies, and Jewish studies.</p>
<p>No one has documented the long-term psychological damage of incarceration in the United States more than Haney, who will present a talk entitled "Think Different: Why Everything We've Been Taught About Crime is Wrong and What We Need to Do About It."</p>
<p>During the talk, Haney will discuss "the political and media misrepresentations of the nature and causes of crime in our society and their consequences in helping to fuel a very expensive and misguided set of crime control policies over the last several decades."</p>
<p>Haney holds psychology and law degrees, and has spent his entire career watching prison populations grow while probing the psychology of imprisonment and the causes of violent crime.</p>
<p>During the talk he will present extensive research&#8212;his own and that of a number of others&#8212;demonstrating the developmental and social contextual origins of criminal behavior, including the impact of childhood risk factors, trauma, and maltreatment as well as economic inequality.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is now an entire science of "life course criminology"&#8212;an approach that analyzes people's lives within structural, social, and cultural contexts&#8212;that stands in direct opposition to the simplistic model of "free will" upon which much criminal law and prison policy continues to be based. Haney will conclude by proposing an alternative, preventive model of crime control that stems directly from this fundamentally different understanding of the nature of criminality.</p>
<p>He has interviewed thousands of prisoners, many on death row or in solitary confinement in the nation's growing stable of "supermax" prisons.</p>
<p>After filling their heads with knowledge and food for thought, Teach In "students" can kick back immediately afterward at the <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2830">Alumni Wine Reception: Sunset and Wine</a>, which starts at 4 p.m. at the Cowell Courtyard, within easy walking distance of the Teach-Ins. Admission is $10.</p>

With the drought in mind, this year&#8217;s sale features many &#8220;water-wise&#8221; varieties of food and landscape plants, along with information on water-conserving crops and gardening practices, a free seed exchange hosted by UCSC&#8217;s Demeter Seed Library, and a chance to learn about more about environmental and social issues related to the food system.</p>
<p>The Spring Plant Sale takes place Saturday, May 2, and Sunday, May 3, in the Barn Theater parking lot at the base of the UCSC campus, near the intersection of Bay and High streets in Santa Cruz. The sale will be open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. On Saturday, members of the Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden can enjoy a &#8220;members&#8217; hour&#8221; starting at 9 a.m. (new memberships and renewals are available starting at 8:30 a.m.).</p>
<p>This spring&#8217;s sale will feature a great selection of tomatoes and peppers (sweet and hot), along with eggplants, summer and winter squashes, pumpkins, lettuces, basil, cucumbers, and many other vegetables. Many of these crops do better with a good &#8220;wet/dry&#8221; swing that minimizes water use and some can be dry-farmed once established.</p>
<p>Flower lovers can choose from an array of annuals perfect for homegrown bouquets and landscape plantings. This year&#8217;s offerings include asters, bachelor&#8217;s buttons, hollyhocks, snapdragons, stock, zinnias, and six varieties of sunflowers. Also available are particularly water-thrifty options, including amaranth, poppies, marigolds, white mignonette, statice, and cosmos.</p>
<p>Tomato fans will find plenty to choose from, with more than 30 heirloom, slicer, cherry, and paste varieties available at this year&#8217;s sale, including &#8216;Persimmon&#8217;, &#8216;Rainbow&#8217;s End&#8217;, &#8216;Red Brandywine, &#8216;Juan Flamme&#8217;, &#8216;Sungold&#8217;, &#8216;Sweet 100&#8217;, &#8216;Isis Candy&#8217;, &#8216;Green Doctor&#8217;, &#8216;Chocolate Cherry&#8217;, &#8216;Yellow Pear&#8217;, &#8216;San Marzano&#8217;, &#8216;Principe Borghese&#8217;, &#8216;Early Girl,&#8217; &#8216;Valley Girl&#8217;, &#8216;Pruden's Purple&#8217;, &#8216;Oregon Spring&#8217;, &#8216;Jubilee, &#8216;Mandarin Cross, &#8216;Cherokee Purple&#8217;, and &#8216;Risentraube&#8217;. A number of varieties were selected for their strong performance in cool, coastal settings, while others will thrive in hotter microclimates.</p>
<p>Plenty of perennials will also be available, including salvias, yarrows, and ornamental grasses, Peruvian lilies, lavenders, rosemary and marjoram varieties, fig trees, and blackberry and raspberry starts. Also featured will be a variety of drought-tolerant choices, including coral bell (Heuchera) cultivars, yarrows in a range of colors, Russian sage, <i>Cuphea micropetala</i>, Burmese plumbago, ornamental grasses, and many other favorites. Many of the perennials will be priced at a special rate of 3 for $20 in gallon containers.</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s Demeter Seed Library will host its quarterly free seed exchange at the Spring Plant Sale, on Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. You&#8217;ll find free open-pollinated and heirloom seeds to grow out for your own garden and to share with the library. With &#8220;Regenerating Justice and Our Food System&#8221; as this year&#8217;s plant sale theme, there will also be opportunities to learn more about the food system and its impacts on a variety of social and environmental issues.</p>
<p>The Spring Plant Sale benefits the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden Apprenticeship, a six-month training course in organic farming and gardening. Members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden receive a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available at the sale beginning at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. on Sunday. Your plant purchases and Friends&#8217; memberships will help grow the next generation of organic farmers and gardeners.</p>

</div></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz alums <strong>Jesse Thorn</strong> and <strong>Jordan Morris</strong> will return to Santa Cruz this Friday evening, April 24, for a live taping of their popular podcast <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/jordan-jesse-go">Jordan, Jesse, Go!</a> at The Kuumbwa Jazz Center.</p>
<p>All proceeds will benefit KZSC, the UC Santa Cruz radio station where they both got their start.</p>
<p>Thorn is the host of <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/bullseye"><em><strong>National Public Radio&#8217;s Bullseye</strong></em></a> (formerly known as <em>The Sound of Young America</em>), a weekly celebration of the best of arts and culture. The show is syndicated throughout the country.</p>
<p>Morris is an actor who has also written for the Comedy Central show <em><strong><a href="http://www.cc.com/shows/-midnight">@midnight</a></strong></em>&#160;and Fuel TV&#8217;s <strong><em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486066/">The Daily Habit</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p>Now a resident of Los Angeles, Thorn described what people can expect to see at Friday&#8217;s show in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Jordan Jesse Go</i>! is a very sweet-tempered, open-hearted extravaganza of vulgarity,&#8221; said Thorn. &#8220;It's going to be a particular extravaganza at the Kuumbwa, too--we booked UCSC's all-female a capella group, the Hightones. And we've got one of the country's only comedian/poet/novelist/addiction counseling experts in Bucky Sinister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We've also got a legendary figure in Bay Area indie rock circles, the singer/songwriter and producer John Vanderslice,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And we'll have a game of &#8216;Would You Rather&#8217; with our friend Jim Real--he used to play with us on the air back in our college days, and these days he's a laser scientist. "</p>
<p>"We're also accepting applications for anyone who can play our theme music on the didgeridoo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thorn added that what people <i>shouldn't</i> expect to see at the Kuumbwa show is a public radio show, noting that <i>Jordan Jesse Go!</i> is more of a direct outgrowth of the comedy that he and Morris used to do on their show back in college. &#8220;We wrote radio plays, did a couple of shows from the base of campus in our underpants, that kind of thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;KZSC was a really special opportunity for us,&#8221; Thorn observed. &#8220;Rarely is a place like that--so wild and free--also so competent and nurturing. We both owe a lot to the station and to its just retired faculty advisor Michael Bryant, who always encouraged us to explore our muses. Our comedy and broadcasting careers started there, so it's a thrill to be able to offer something in return.&#8221;</p>
<p>The benefit show takes place in the midst of the <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend2015/?utm_source=ucschomepage&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_content=eventsbox-aw-home&amp;utm_campaign=aw-2015"><em><strong>50th anniversary Alumni Weekend</strong> </em></a>at UC Santa Cruz. It&#8217;s also during KZSC's Spring Pledge Drive, which runs April 21 through April 30.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope the benefit at Kuumbwa will be a gathering place for all the returning alumni and also our longtime local listeners to celebrate the collective creation that is KZSC,&#8221; noted station manager Keith Rozendal. &#8220;UC Santa Cruz didn't start out with a radio station, but students built one right away in 1967. A lot of our audience has been tuning in for years, and we hear a lot of fond memories about KZSC shows and personalities from the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of our alumni may not know that we broadcast at 20,000 watts now, to the entire Monterey Bay and up the Salinas River valley,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And <a href="http://kzsc.org/">kzsc.org</a> is the way to connect from afar.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Jesse, he&#8217;s glad to be coming back to Santa Cruz for this year's Alumni Weekend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty years of UCSC is kind of tough to imagine--it still feels like a crazy upstart,&#8221; said Thorn. &#8220;I was lucky to study with some professors who were there at the beginning, and they told us some amazing stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The best of UC Santa Cruz, I think, is that it's a public school with a renegade vision--which is something you don't find every day,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We're excited to be there for this big weekend.&#8221;</p>

<p>This weekend follows a series of anniversary events that began with our kick-off "Dress Like It's 1965 Day" in January. The festivities have included two art exhibits, &#8220;50 Artists in 5 Decades&#8221; and &#8220;An Uncommon Place,&#8221; as well as events honoring our founders, Page and Eloise Smith and Dean and Jane McHenry. And we&#8217;ve hosted several major speakers, including Angela Davis and Anita Hill, as well as the Climate Science conference.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we have many more events and activities during the rest of the celebration year. Please mark your calendars now for Saturday, September 26, when we will host our annual Founders Celebration on campus, under a tent on the East field.</p>
<p>We will award our Foundation Medal to Alice Waters of Chez Panisse for her groundbreaking work promoting a sustainable planet through community building and farm-to-table eating.

<p>Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, measured the amount of disease on the leaves of plants in a meadow on the UC Santa Cruz campus. They found that the amount of disease on each species depended on how common it was, as well as on the abundance of its close relatives. The results, published April 23 in <i>Nature</i>, revealed a tight link between the structure of a plant community and the vulnerability of individual species to disease. In addition, when the researchers introduced novel plant species into the grassland, they were able to predict which ones would be most strongly affected by naturally occurring diseases.</p>
<p>Ingrid Parker, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and first author of the paper, said the study adds an important new dimension to a longstanding concept in ecology known as the "rare species advantage." Diseases often take a greater toll on the most common species because pathogens spread more quickly when there are many susceptible individuals close together. This promotes biodiversity by creating openings for less common species that are not attacked by the same pathogens.</p>
<p>"The rare species advantage is thought to be a major driver of biodiversity in natural ecosystems," Parker said. "Our study shows that it's not just how common a species is, but also the structure of the whole community around it that affects its vulnerability to disease. Most pathogens are not host specialists; they can move from one species to another, and whether pathogens 'spill over' depends on how closely related the other species are."</p>
<p><strong>Introduced species</strong></p>
<p>After studying disease pressure on the naturally occurring species in the grassland, the researchers then introduced 44 novel plant species from outside of California. (These plants were removed before they reproduced.) They found that species with few close relatives in the grassland escaped disease, while those closely related to many resident species always showed high levels of disease. The researchers were able to make surprisingly accurate predictions of disease pressure on novel species based on their "phylogenetic" or evolutionary distance from the local species.</p>
<p>"It was kind of shocking how well we were able to predict disease pressure at a local scale," Parker said.</p>
<p>To incorporate the phylogenetic distance between species into their predictions of disease dynamics, the researchers used a "PhyloSusceptibility model" developed by Gregory Gilbert, professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz, and two other coauthors, Roger Magarey and Karl Suiter of North Carolina State University, who work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). The model is based on the USDA's global database of fungal pathogens and host plants and can be used to predict the probability of two species sharing a pathogen.</p>
<p>"APHIS is interested in this because they're concerned with identifying risks from introduced pathogens," Gilbert said. "If a plant pathogen from Brazil suddenly shows up in southern California, you want to know what plants in California are most likely to be attacked."</p>
<p>By showing that the PhyloSusceptibility model makes accurate predictions, the study suggests a wide range of potential applications. "It's a predictive tool that's flexible and useful when you don't have lots of other data at hand," Gilbert said. "Ideally, you'd like to have empirical data on host ranges, but that's very rarely available."</p>
<p>The PhyloSusceptibility model could help avoid disease problems affecting proposed horticultural imports or reforestation projects.&#160; It could also be used in agriculture to design intercropping or rotation systems that could decrease crop disease compared to monocultures. Imported plants can also bring novel pathogens and pests into an area, and the PhyloSusceptibility model could be used to assess the vulnerability of local species to pathogen spillover from proposed plant introductions.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Invasive weeds</strong></p>
<p>According to Parker, the findings also help explain why some introduced plants become invasive weeds while others do not. A common explanation for invasive species is the absence of natural enemies in their new environment. In earlier studies, however, Parker and Gilbert found that introduced species can be attacked by many of the same pathogens as native species. The new study shows why the presence of closely related species makes it less likely an introduced species will escape from natural enemies. The PhyloSusceptibility model could help predict the future distributions of invasive species, Parker said.</p>
<p>While the PhyloSusceptibility model used in this study was based on data for fungal pathogens, Gilbert said the team has also created versions based on data for eight other groups of pests and pathogens, including insects, nematodes, bacteria, and viruses. "They vary a bit, but the influence of phylogenetic distance on pathogen sharing is similar for all groups," he said.</p>
<p>The PhyloSusceptibility model is currently available for beta testing online at <a href="http://cisr-stats.cisr.ucsc.edu/aphis/">cisr-stats.cisr.ucsc.edu/aphis/</a>. In addition to Parker, Gilbert, Magarey, and Suiter, the coauthors of the study include UC Santa Cruz postdoctoral fellow Megan Saunders and undergraduates Megan Bontrager, Andrew Weitz, and Rebecca Hendricks. This research was funded by the National Science Foundation and USDA APHIS.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ddb5ef87807270173df02958b1101465"><name>exoplanet-coalition</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz part of NASA coalition leading search for life on distant worlds</title><summary>Astrophysicist Jonathan Fortney is one of 15 principal investigators for a new NASA initiative searching for life on planets around other stars.</summary><keywords>Jonathan Fortney, astrobiology, NExSS</keywords><start-date>1429599600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz part of NASA coalition leading search for life on distant worlds</display-name><path>/2015/04/exoplanet-coalition</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/exoplanet-coalition</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1429648830312</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1430178904080</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/jfortney-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/jfortney-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jfortney-350.jpg</name><display-name>jfortney-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>116335</file-size><width>350</width><height>425</height></image><image-alt>Jonathan Fortney</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/jfortney-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/jfortney-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jfortney-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jfortney-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26713</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jonathan Fortney</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jonathan Fortney</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz astrophysicist Jonathan Fortney is one of 15 principal investigators for a new NASA initiative that is embracing a team approach to the quest for life on planets around other stars. The Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) will benefit from the expertise of several dozen scientists across the NASA science community in an effort to find clues to life on faraway worlds.</p>
<p>Fortney, an associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, will lead a team exploring how novel statistical methods can be used to extract information from the light emitted and reflected by planetary atmospheres in order to understand their atmospheric temperatures and the abundance of molecules. Astronomers routinely analyze the light from distant stars by spreading it out into a spectrum of different wavelengths. Fortney is developing tools for analyzing the spectra of distant planets to determine molecular abundances in their atmospheres.</p>
<p>"In the future, when we obtain spectra of Earth-like planets around other stars, we'll want to know if we can see things like methane and oxygen in their atmospheres, and we'll want to quantify the amounts of those different gases," he said. "In the present era, we can retrieve the abundances of molecules in the atmospheres of brighter, hotter, well-studied objects like brown dwarfs and giant planets. This allows us to test and hone our tools for the future."</p>
<p>In bringing together the "best and brightest," the NExSS team hopes to better understand the various components of an exoplanet, as well as how the parent stars and neighbor planets may interact to support life.</p>
<p>The study of exoplanets--planets around other stars--is a relatively new field, with the first discovery in 1995. Researchers at UC Santa Cruz pioneered techniques for detecting exoplanets. The launch of NASA's Kepler space telescope six years ago greatly increased the rate of discovery. More than 1,800 exoplanets are now known, with thousands of additional candidates waiting to be confirmed. Some of these worlds are potentially habitable, so now scientists are developing ways to confirm the habitability of these worlds and search them for signs of life (biosignatures).</p>
<p>Key to this effort is to understand how biology interacts with the atmosphere, geology, oceans, and interior of a planet, and how these interactions are affected by the host star. This "system science" approach is what NExSS will use to better understand how we can look for life on exoplanets.</p>
<p>NExSS will solve this problem by tapping into the collective expertise from each of the divisions in NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Earth scientists developed this systems science approach by studying our home planet. Planetary scientists have applied systems science to a wide variety of worlds within our solar system. Heliophysicists add another layer to this systems science approach by looking in detail at how the sun interacts with the planets that orbit it. Astrophysicists are providing data on the exoplanets and host stars for the application of this systems science framework.</p>
<p>These different research communities, often unaware of work outside of their own disciplines, will be brought together by NExSS to share their perspectives, research results, and approaches. This collaboration will help classify the diversity of worlds being discovered, understand the potential habitability of these worlds, and inform the development of tools and technologies needed in the search for life beyond Earth. Through this work, NExSS will play a key role in the pursuit of one of humanity's deepest questions: Are we alone?</p>
<p>NExSS will be led by scientists from the NASA Ames Research Center, the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology, and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. It will include team members from 10 different universities, three NASA centers, and two research institutes. These teams were selected from proposals from across NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-nexss-coalition-to-lead-search-for-life-on-distant-worlds</url><title>NASA Announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="de4bf764807270173df02958c634849d"><name>princeton-green-50</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz named one of Princeton Review's top 50 'greenest' colleges</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz once again ranks high among the nation’s “greenest” colleges and universities.</summary><start-date>1429657200000</start-date><display-name>Princeton Review</display-name><path>/2015/04/princeton-green-50</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/princeton-green-50</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1429658662713</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1439577653919</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>UC Santa Cruz Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/princeton-green-50-jmac-480.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/princeton-green-50-jmac-480.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>princeton-green-50-jmac-480.jpg</name><display-name>princeton-green-50-jmac-480.jpg</display-name><file-size>83158</file-size><width>480</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt>campus bike path</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/princeton-green-50-80.png</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/princeton-green-50-80.png</link><site>news</site><name>princeton-green-50-80.png</name><display-name>princeton-green-50-80.png</display-name><file-size>13631</file-size><width>80</width><height>81</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Princeton Review green 50 logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The campus was also recently highlighted in the <a href="http://www.aashe.org/publications/sustainability-review/2014-Higher-Education-Sustainability-Review">2014 Higher Education Sustainability Review</a> for its efforts on water reduction and student engagement.

<p>The <em>Princeton Review's</em> <em><a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/green-guide">Guide to 353 Green Colleges: 2015 Edition</a></em> profiles colleges with the most exceptional commitments to sustainability based on their academic offerings and career preparation for students, campus policies, initiatives, and activities.</p>
<p>New to the 2015 edition is a ranked list of the "Top 50 Green Colleges" on which UC Santa Cruz captured the No. 32 spot, third highest in the UC system.&#160; UC Santa Barbara ranked No. 3 and UC Irvine ranked No. 16.&#160; Lewis and Clark College in Portland was named No. 1.</p>
<p>The ranking is an endorsement of the campus&#8217;s comprehensive approach to sustainability that encompasses education, food, transportation, waste reduction, water conservation and much more.</p>
<p>The campus was also recently highlighted in the <a href="http://www.aashe.org/publications/sustainability-review/2014-Higher-Education-Sustainability-Review">2014 Higher Education Sustainability Review</a> for its efforts on water reduction and student engagement.</p>
<p>Information on the qualities and attributes that make UC Santa Cruz &#8220;green&#8221; are taken from the Sustainability Tracking Assessment and Rating System <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/governance/plans-reports/">2014 report</a>, which records data related to sustainability in teaching and education, operations, and planning, administration and engagement.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has always ranked high among the most sustainable colleges and universities.&#160; Campus efforts are evident in water reduction and transportation as well co-curricular education.</p>
<p>"Among nearly 10,000 teens who participated in our <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college-hopes-worries">2015 College Hopes &amp; Worries Survey</a>, 61 percent told us that having information about a school&#8217;s commitment to the environment would influence their decision to apply to or attend the college," said Robert Franek, <em>Princeton Review's</em> senior vice president and publisher. "We strongly recommend the schools in this guide to environmentally-minded students who seek to study and live at green colleges."</p>
<p>Franek noted compelling facts about the top 50 colleges on the guide's new ranking list. Among this group of schools:</p>
<ul>
<li>33 percent of their total food expenditures go to purchases of local and/or organic food</li>
<li>81 percent of the new construction on their campuses is U.S. Green Building Council LEED-certified</li>
<li>96 percent offer an undergraduate major or degree that is sustainability focused</li>
<li>98 percent have a sustainability officer and sustainability committee</li>

Freedom--</i>an animated short by UC Santa Cruz associate professor of art&#160;Dee Hibbert-Jones and San Francisco artist Nomi Talisman--was honored with two awards at the 18th annual <a href="http://www.fullframefest.org"><em><b>Full Frame Documentary Film Festival</b></em></a>.</p>
<p>It received the Jury Award for &#8220;Best Short,&#8221; qualifying the film for a possible nomination for an Academy Award next year in the category of "Best Documentary (Short Subject)."</p>
<p>In choosing <i>Last Day of Freedom</i> for the award, the festival judges noted: &#8220;This film demonstrates and reminds us of the simple power and intimacy of the human voice.&#160;It interweaves different visual styles of animation and engages the audience fully in an increasingly fraught tale that ultimately presents the supreme cost of doing the right thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The short blends animation with poignant testimony to create a haunting story of a man who discovers his brother has committed a serious crime.</p>
<p>The 32-minute film is a portrait of a man at the crossroads of some of the most pressing social issues of the day--including veterans&#8217; care, mental health access, and criminal justice.</p>
<p><i>Last Day of Freedom</i> also received &#8220;The Center for Documentary Studies Filmmaker Award,&#8221; presented by the Duke University Center for Documentary Studies.</p>
<p>This award honors a documentary artist whose work is a potential catalyst for education and change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming from a fine arts background (both of us) and photography background (Nomi), we are long time admirers of the Center for Documentary Studies,&#8221; said Hibbert-Jones. &#8220;Joining the long, prestigious line of previous filmmakers to win this award is more than we ever wished for.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Full Frame festival is an annual international event dedicated to the theatrical exhibition of nonfiction cinema. One of the nation&#8217;s premier documentary film festivals, Full Frame is a qualifying event for consideration for nominations for both the Academy Award<b>&#174;</b> for Best Documentary Short Subject and The Producers Guild of America Awards.</p>

If so, how would you know?&#160; What&#8217;s your telltale sign? &#8220;Rings&#8221; under your eyes? Grouchiness? Over/under-eating? Plain old sick in bed? Regardless, it helps to de-stress with techniques like massage and biofeedback-enhanced relaxation exercises. UCSC students now have easier access to both with the launch of the Relaxation Station, a set of stress management skill-building resources for students to access with drop-in and self-serve convenience.</span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">The Relaxation Station provides free stress management resources in a private section of the <a href="http://caps.ucsc.edu/">Counseling &amp; Psychological Services</a> (CAPS) waiting room at the Student Health Center, when CAPS is open. A top-notch reclining chair provides massages that can be programmed to each student&#8217;s preferences. While reclining and enjoying a massage, students can use noise-cancelling headphones to listen to guided relaxation exercises from a tablet.</span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">The official launch of the Relaxation Station will take place at 4:15 p.m. on Thursday, April 23, 2015&#8212;just in time to manage stress related to the first midterm exams of the quarter. The popular resources are available for 15 minutes at a time when there&#8217;s a line, but those next-in-line will be able to use biofeedback-enhanced programs that build stress coping skills until it&#8217;s their turn to enter the Relaxation Station.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Students</audience><admin>Dr. Dorje M.

<p>Bruce, who grew up in Santa Cruz and graduated from Santa Cruz High School, is managing director and co-founder of Alcentra, an international asset management group.&#160; He is also a generous donor to UC Santa Cruz and currently serves as a trustee on the UC Santa Cruz Foundation. He was the first chair of the UC Santa Cruz Social Sciences Board of Councilors that advises Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki, and later helped start a similar board in Southern California and serves as its chair.</p>
<p>The Distinguished Social Sciences Alumni Award was first awarded in 2006 to Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporter Dana Priest, and is presented each year to a social sciences graduate whose career is characterized by sustained and exemplary contributions to society through research, practice, education, policy, or service.</p>
<p>The Board of Councilors makes the selection from nominations from alumni. Past winners include two judges, a nuclear weapons policy expert, an educator and social justice advocate, a community organizer, fundraiser and philanthropist, a land conservationist, and an NPR correspondent. The award was presented Friday, April 24 in a ceremony at the La Feliz Room, Seymour Center.</p>
<p>In 2006, Bruce established the Mark Bruce Fellowships for Future Math and Science Teachers at UC Santa Cruz in honor of his late brother, who died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. He also established the Robert Meister Scholars Fund to support graduate students in politics and honor a favorite professor.&#160;</p>
<p>Four years later, he established the Bruce Initiative on Rethinking Capitalism working with Meister. Over the years, Bruce has supported marine sciences, gaming, Asian studies, writing programs, a water lab, and other programs at UCSC.</p>
<p>Attending UC Santa Cruz &#8220;was the best thing I ever did,&#8221; Bruce said when he founded the Mark Bruce Fellowship. &#8220;I wanted to study. I wanted to learn how to think.&#8221;</p>
<p>His advice for other alumni: "They should hunt down old professors, talk to students, fund a scholarship, or fund a speaker series," Bruce said. "It's so easy to get engaged."</p>

<p>His talk, "Volcanism as the Re-creation of Earth," will take place at 7:30 p.m. in the Music Recital Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus. It is free and open to the public. Parking staff will be on duty at the Performing Arts lot to offer complimentary parking for the lecture.</p>
<p>Gill will explore the impacts of volcanic eruptions and their significance as a primary mechanism of planetary change. The magmas that erupt from volcanoes are highly variable because the rock that melts is so variable, resulting in different kinds of eruptions and volcanoes. Gill's illustrated talk will summarize the three main volcanic regimes on Earth, with an emphasis on the subduction zones where tectonic plates converge, which Gill has spent most of his career studying. The magmas in subduction zones are unique to Earth, are the most explosive, create the most valuable metal deposits, and produce the continents on which we live.</p>
<p>Gill is an expert on volcanoes and the study of how volcanic magmas evolve within the earth. He served as vice chancellor for research at UC Santa Cruz from 1994 to 2000. Gill retired from teaching and administration in 2010, but continues to have an active research program. He received a Humboldt Research Award in 2011 and was elected a fellow of the American Geophysical Union in 2014. Gill earned his B.S. in geology from Wheaton College and Ph.D. in geochemistry from Australian National University. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1972.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>05-12-2015</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fccadeda807270173df02958ba5187fd"><name>grad-symposium</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Graduate students present research projects at annual symposium</title><summary>The 11th Annual Graduate Research Symposium on April 24 featured graduate student researchers from across the divisions.</summary><keywords>Graduate Research Symposium</keywords><start-date>1430118000000</start-date><display-name>Graduate students present research projects at annual symposium</display-name><path>/2015/04/grad-symposium</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/grad-symposium</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1430170295946</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1430170557866</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Arts</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/symposium-banner.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/symposium-banner.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>symposium-banner.jpg</name><display-name>symposium-banner.jpg</display-name><file-size>74292</file-size><width>400</width><height>165</height></image><image-alt>symposium banner</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/cacao-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/cacao-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cacao-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cacao-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>29103</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Michelle Aguilar</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/cacao-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/cacao-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cacao-400.jpg</name><display-name>cacao-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>74614</file-size><width>400</width><height>248</height></image><image-alt>grad student discussing media presentation</image-alt><image-caption><p>Michelle Aguilar (right) won the Alumni Association Award in the Arts Division for her media presentation "El Cacao."</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Graduate student researchers from across the divisions explained their work to a diverse audience during the 11th Annual <a href="http://graddiv.ucsc.edu/current-students/student-achievements/graduate-research-symposium.html">Graduate Research Symposium</a> at McHenry Library on Friday, April 24.

Mikucki)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Beneath Antarctica's ice-free McMurdo Dry Valleys lies a salty aquifer that may support previously unknown microbial ecosystems and retain evidence of ancient climate change, according to a new study published April 28 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz glaciologist Slawek Tulaczyk was part of a team of researchers who gathered compelling evidence of groundwater in the Dry Valleys using a novel, helicopter-borne sensor to penetrate below the surface of large swathes of terrain. The team found that brines (salty water) form extensive aquifers below glaciers and lakes and within permanently frozen soils. The brines may also play an important role in contemporary biological processes in the Dry Valleys.</p>
<p>"Our electromagnetic data indicate that the margins of Antarctica may shelter a vast microbial habitat, in which the limits of life are tested by difficult physical and chemical conditions," said Tulacyzk, a coauthor of the paper and professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. "Over billions of years of evolution, microbes seem to have adapted to conditions in almost all surface and near-surface environments on Earth. Tiny pore spaces filled with hyper-saline brine staying liquid down to minus 15 degrees Celsius [five degrees Fahrenheit] may pose one of the greatest challenges to microbes."</p>
<p><strong>Past surface ecosystems</strong></p>
<p>First author Jill Mikucki of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, led the study. "These unfrozen materials appear to be relics of past surface ecosystems, and our findings provide compelling evidence that they now provide deep subsurface habitats for microbial life despite extreme environmental conditions," Mikucki said. "We believe the application of novel below-ground visualization technologies can not only reveal hidden microbial habitats, but can also provide insight on glacial dynamics and how Antarctica responds to climate change."</p>
<p>The team found evidence that brines flow towards the Antarctic coast from roughly 18 kilometers (11 miles) inland, eventually discharging into the Southern Ocean. It is possible that nutrients from microbial weathering in these deep brines are released into the ocean and affect near-shore biological productivity. However, the vast majority of Antarctica's coastal margins remain unexplored. This new survey highlights the importance of these sensitive interfaces.</p>
<p>In addition to providing answers about the biological adaptations of previously unknown ecosystems that persist in the extreme cold and dark of the Antarctic winter, the new information could also help scientists to understand whether similar conditions might exist elsewhere in the solar system. During the Antarctic summer, conditions in the Dry Valleys resemble those on the surface on Mars.</p>
<p><strong>International team</strong></p>
<p>The researchers were part of an international, interdisciplinary team that used a transient electromagnetic sensor called SkyTEM, mounted to helicopter, to produce extensive imagery of the subsurface of the Dry Valleys, the coldest, driest desert on our planet. Using a helicopter to make the observations allowed large areas of rugged terrain to be surveyed.</p>
<p>The new SkyTEM results shed light on the history and evolution of the Dry Valley landscape, the largest ice-free region in Antarctica. During the height of the southern summer, the Dry Valleys have free-flowing rivers and streams. They are also home to briny lakes at the surface and beneath at least one of the glaciers that intrude into the Valleys.</p>
<p>During the surveys, SkyTEM was flown over the Taylor Glacier, one of the best-studied glaciers in the world. Taylor Glacier has a unique feature known as Blood Falls, where red, iron-rich brine from the subsurface is released at the front of the glacier. Blood Falls is known to harbor an active microbial community where organisms use iron and sulfur compounds for energy and growth and, in the process, facilitate rock weathering.</p>
<p>According to Tulaczyk, the newly discovered brines beneath the Dry Valleys may harbor similar microbial communities. He is involved in another project in which researchers are drilling into Taylor Glacier to extract samples of the brine that emerges at Blood Falls.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Antarctic climate change</strong></p>
<p>Research in the Dry Valleys may help scientists understand how the Antarctic climate has changed over geologic time, said coauthor Ross Virginia, a biogeochemist at Dartmouth College. "This project is studying the past and present climate to, in part, understand how climate change in the future will affect biodiversity and ecosystem processes," Virginia said. "This fantastic new view beneath the surface will help us sort out competing ideas and theories about how the Dry Valleys have changed with time and how this history influences what we see today."</p>
<p>The SkyTEM technology was developed at Aarhus University in Denmark. SkyTEM lead Esben Auken has flown the sensor all over the world, but this was the first time they tackled Antarctica. "Antarctica is by far the most challenging place we have been," Auken said. "It was all worth it when we saw the raw data as it was offloaded from the helicopter; it clearly showed we were on to some extraordinary results which no one had been able to produce before."</p>
<p>Co-authors on the paper include researchers from UC Santa Cruz, University of Tennessee, Dartmouth College, University of Illinois at Chicago, Louisiana State University, University of Wisconsin, Aarhus University in Denmark, and Sorbonne Universit&#233;s, UPMC University in France.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation's Division of Polar Programs supported the SkyTEM project through a collaborative award to Mikucki, Virginia, and Tulacyzk. The division manages the U.S. Antarctic Program, through which it coordinates all U.S. scientific research on Antarctica and provides the logistical support to that research.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://science360.gov/radio/episode/aa800e2c-f22d-491f-bb44-c110584b6c14/scientists-detect-salty-groundwater-networks-antarcticas-mcmurdo-dry-valleys-using</url><title>NSF Science 360 Radio story</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fcff5f93807270173df029582e7dce21"><name>brant-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two-week Faculty and Staff Giving Drive begins Monday</title><summary>By Keith Brant, Vice Chancellor, University Relations — Faculty and staff at UC Santa Cruz change the world every day.

For many, that generosity of spirit includes being donors to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>For the two-week period beginning next Monday, May 4, the first <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/faculty-staff/">Faculty and Staff Giving Drive</a> will be held to encourage all faculty and staff to extend their investment in the university by becoming donors. Many faculty and staff &#8211; more than 400 last year &#8211; make gifts to UC Santa Cruz throughout the year. This short, focused drive is an effort to increase awareness of the impact of giving and to increase participation.</p>
<p>This campaign was developed in partnership with faculty and staff volunteers and advocates. &#160;Greg Gilbert, professor of environmental studies, and Maria Choy, staff member at Long Marine Lab, are co-chairing this effort. Together, we are building a culture of philanthropy on campus.</p>
<p>Our 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary year is a special opportunity to celebrate our achievements and invest in our future. When faculty and staff become donors, we send a strong message to others about the value we place on our work. As donors, faculty and staff can also encourage alumni and friends to support their favorite part of UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Gifts of every size are valued. Collectively, our gifts impact &#160;the people and programs we support. All gifts count toward the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>, which supports the mission of the university as it grows in national and international stature. And our new <a href="http://connect.ucsc.edu/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=1795&amp;cid=3427&amp;post_id=0">online payroll deduction</a> option makes giving easier than ever.</p>
<p>Our gifts support whatever we designate. Among the many possibilities: undergraduate scholarships, graduate fellowships, the student emergency fund, the UCSC Fund, and the effort to reopen the Quarry Amphitheater.</p>
<p>I hope you will join me in making UC Santa Cruz one of your philanthropic priorities. Thank you to all who already give&#8212;you have inspired this effort.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fd021cbd807270173df029583614190f"><name>50th-alumni-weekend-feature-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>An Alumni Weekend to remember</title><summary>A record-breaking crowd of 2,500 revelers, more than half of them alumni, took part in UC Santa Cruz's Alumni Weekend this year—a special edition of the event that was bigger and more elaborate than ever before in honor of the campus's 50th anniversary. </summary><start-date>1430174280000</start-date><display-name>50th-alumni-weekend-feature-story</display-name><path>/2015/04/50th-alumni-weekend-feature-story</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/50th-alumni-weekend-feature-story</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1430173916281</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1430422512836</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Feminist Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>50 years</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/Alumni 50th Sanjayan Kurtz photo.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/Alumni 50th Sanjayan Kurtz photo.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Alumni 50th Sanjayan Kurtz photo.jpg</name><display-name>Alumni 50th Sanjayan Kurtz photo.jpg</display-name><file-size>32604</file-size><width>350</width><height>233</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/balloon-sammy-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/balloon-sammy-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>balloon-sammy-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>balloon-sammy-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>9230</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alumni Weekend attendees</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>M.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>A record-breaking crowd of 2,500 revelers, more than half of them alumni, took part in UC Santa Cruz's Alumni Weekend this year&#8212;a special edition of the event that was bigger and more elaborate than ever before in honor of the campus's 50th anniversary.</p>
<p>Attendees enjoyed lectures and panels, a farm-style lunch al fresco overlooking Monterey Bay, tours and scavenger hunts, musical performances, reunions, presentations, alumni wines and beers, and each other's company. At the end of the day, they warmed their feet at a blazing bonfire while eating s'mores and listening to ukulele versions of vintage mid-'60s tunes.</p>

<p>The celebration kicked off on Friday with the sold-out all-day <strong>TEDx Santa Cruz</strong> "Radical Collaboration" event in Santa Cruz's Rio Theatre featuring 24 speakers and an eclectic mix of science, poetry, music, education, philanthropy, and ecology.</p>
<p>That evening, M. Sanjayan (Ph.D. biology, '97), host of the new groundbreaking PBS nature series <em>EARTH A New Wild,</em> wowed a capacity crowd with tales from the field and breathtaking footage of wildlife across the globe, highlighting the role of conservation in improving human well-being, wildlife, and the environment.</p>
<p>"Humans need nature a lot more than nature needs us," he said during his keynote talk, "<strong>A New Wild: Saving Nature in a Human-Dominated World.</strong>"</p>
<p>During the event, Sanjayan was also presented with the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Achievement Award, the highest honor bestowed on a graduate of the campus.</p>
<p>In a nod to the campus's history, many Alumni Weekend events, including a sit-down Banana Slug Lunch with farm-fresh offerings, took place at Cowell College&#8212;the first college at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Jane Hanson (Cowell '71, history) strolled through Cowell on Saturday morning, greeting old friends. She said she was grateful that staff members were handing out nametags to everyone. "I look the same," she observed drily. "But everybody else looks so different!"</p>
<p>Richard Shaffer (Cowell '69, philosophy) drew many belly laughs during his remarks at an informal symposium called <strong>The Creation of Beauty in the Company of Friends</strong> at the Page Smith Library.</p>
<p>Shaffer, a noted artist, and part of UC Santa Cruz's pioneer class, recalled a startling conversation with history professor, UC Santa Cruz visionary and Cowell founding provost Page Smith, who confessed to him, around the time of Shaffer's graduation, "The reason you were admitted is I just thought your picture was interesting." Smith also said, "You are one of our weird ones. What are you going to do now?"</p>
<p>But Shaffer said UC Santa Cruz was a great preparation for an adventurous life. He said the early campus "connected me with the ongoing idea of an experiment, a sense of invention, risk-taking, play. All those things were supported by my teachers."</p>
<h2>Misty-eyed remembrances</h2>
<p>Out in Cowell Plaza, a group of alumni were asked to shout out the three things that came to mind when they looked back on their years at UC Santa Cruz. "Peace, love, activism," one early 1980s alumna said. One, attributing her career success to her time at UC Santa Cruz, shouted out, "My monthly paycheck!"</p>
<p>When it was her turn to shout three memorable things, Yanelli Torres (Crown sociology, '12), shouted out, "Cardiac Hill. The view. Banana slugs."</p>
<p>Torres recalled her initial surprise when she drove up to campus for the first time to take classes. "At first it felt a little weird," she confessed. "I remember driving through dry grass, past the cows. I didn't know what to expect&#8212;and the road kept going up and up and up."</p>
<p>But she acclimated quickly, becoming a resident advisor and orientation leader. "I got confidence. I gained leadership skills. I grew up."</p>
<p>Michael Masek (Cowell '70, history), standing at the edge of the same courtyard, went from joyfully irreverent to teary-eyed as he looked back on his UC Santa Cruz days.</p>
<p>He said his time there was a deeply rewarding experience and mentioned the professors who shaped his outlook during his time as a student.</p>
<p>"Mary Holmes (a beloved founding faculty member, artist, and art historian) was not a retiring sort," he recalled. Early in his time on campus, he said something he thought was profound. "She immediately said, 'Young man, how could you be so na&#239;ve?' Bam!"</p>
<p>But Holmes tempered her demanding style with caring and generosity. "She was very affirming without being patronizing at all," he said. "Her attitude was: 'I am going to treat you as a real person with a real brain, and with high expectations.' She didn't sugarcoat her criticisms at all. It was delightful."</p>
<p>He also credits UC Santa Cruz for keeping him out of the Vietnam War, and bringing his wife&#8212;alumna Alice Frahm Masek&#8212;into his life. They met on campus and have been together ever since.</p>
<p>Nostalgia had a similar effect on Andy Mione (Stevenson '96, psychology), founder of a psychology counseling center in Auburn, helping over 100 people a day. He stood by and watched his kids, Bella, 8, and Nico, 5, romp around the Banana Slug Kid Zone, a family-friendly craft and activity area.</p>
<p>"This experience here surpassed the wildest dreams I had about what college would be like," he said. "And now here I am with my beautiful family."</p>
<h2>Restoring Quarry glory</h2>
<p>Bruce Steiner (Crown '77, psychobiology) sounded a similar note of nostalgia and family continuity when he paused in front of the scenic Quarry Amphitheater, an award-winning outdoor event space that has played host to lectures, graduations, and concerts but was closed in 2006 for safety reasons.</p>
<p>Restoring and reopening the Quarry Amphitheater is among the priorities of <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/">The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>.</p>
<p>"This was the center of campus," Steiner said. He recalled some grand moments as well as some surprising ones, such as the time he saw a porcupine waddle across the grounds.</p>
<p>This quiet place gave him a timeless feeling. "When I was here, Jerry Brown was governor," he said. "Now my daughter is here, and Jerry Brown is governor again."</p>
<p>Nearby, in Quarry Plaza, De-Neita Peoples (College Ten '09, political science), helping out at the African Appreciation Day event, remembered when she first showed up to campus and had to get through some lonely times. She found fellowship and a comforting sense of community at Delta Sigma Theta, a traditionally African American sorority.</p>
<p>Since arriving there, she's worked hard to expand diversity at UC Santa Cruz. She became part of an effort to bring admitted African American high school students up to campus for a weekend to get a vivid sense of college life. "We needed them to know there was a community of people up here that was going to support them."</p>
<h2>Back to school</h2>
<p>Aside from surrendering to nostalgia, attendants re-experienced classroom learning but without the stress of exams and with a wide assortment of topics from film and law to art and writing.</p>
<p>As part of the <strong>True Originals</strong> speaker series, Paul Hall (Merrill '72) l moderated an interdisciplinary panel of distinguished alumni who took a close look at the interplay of money and power in political and governing systems; from campaign finance and the effect of money in politics to legal and political responses to global warming and climate change.</p>
<p>Film producer Ron Yerxa (Grad Division '74) had a spirited dialogue with arts writer, journalist, and novelist Wallace Baine about American film comedies. Yerxa spoke of filmmakers who worked hard to find "the sweet spot"&#8212;making movies that take on weighty issues while entertaining the viewer.</p>
<p>He also spoke of the profound influence that UC Santa Cruz has had on his career, and, in particular, the teachings of professor emeritus of American studies John Dizikes. "He's kind of the Brad Pitt of university professors," Yerxa remarked.</p>
<p>During this year's <strong>Teach-In</strong> events, psychology professor Craig Haney drew gasps from the capacity crowd when he showed a chart illustrating the exponential increase in American incarceration rates over the past few decades. He also argued that inaccurate portrayals of crime and its causes have guided the U.S's criminal justice system.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz professor of feminist studies Bettina Aptheker delivered a talk about "Feminism and Social Justice" to a rapt crowd that included a large number of her former students. Though much of the talk was sobering&#8212;Aptheker drew links between animus toward abortion rights with rape culture and violence against women&#8212;she ended the talk with inspiring words from the late Adrienne Rich, a celebrated poet who was a longtime Santa Cruz resident. Rich was a mentor to Aptheker.</p>
<p>"We need to imagine a world in which every woman is the presiding genius of her own body," Rich wrote. "In such a world, women will truly create life, bring forth not only children (if we choose) but the visions, and the thinking necessary to sustain, console, and alter human existence&#8212;a new relationship to the universe."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.flickr.com/photos/ucsantacruz/sets/72157652216165831/</url><title>Our favorite photos from Alumni Weekend 2015</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.flickr.com/photos/ucsantacruz/sets/72157652138014411/</url><title>See all of the photos from our alumni photo booth</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="05e9a5a4807270173df02958cfc961aa"><name>kirshner-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cosmologist Robert Kirshner explores accelerating universe in public talk on May 13</title><summary>Kirshner's talk, "The Accelerating Universe: Einstein's Blunder Undone," is free and open to the public.</summary><keywords>Robert Kirshner, Mandel Lecture</keywords><start-date>1430290800000</start-date><display-name>Cosmologist Robert Kirshner explores accelerating universe in public talk May 13</display-name><path>/2015/04/kirshner-lecture</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/kirshner-lecture</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1430323307883</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1430862390335</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/robert-kirshner.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/robert-kirshner.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>robert-kirshner.jpg</name><display-name>robert-kirshner.jpg</display-name><file-size>15454</file-size><width>293</width><height>438</height></image><image-alt>Robert Kirshner</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/04/images/robert-kirshner-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/04/images/robert-kirshner-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>robert-kirshner-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>robert-kirshner-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21265</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Robert Kirshner</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Robert Kirshner</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Cosmologist Robert Kirshner will discuss dark energy and the accelerating expansion of the universe in a free public lecture on Wednesday, May 13, at 7 p.m. at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Kirshner's talk, "The Accelerating Universe: Einstein's Blunder Undone," is presented by the UC Santa Cruz Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and UC Observatories as part of the Mandel Lecture Series.</p>
<p>Kirshner, the Clowes Professor of Science at Harvard University, is a frequent public lecturer on science. He teaches a general education course for Harvard undergraduates entitled "The Energetic Universe" and is the author of <i>The Extravagant Universe: Exploding stars, dark energy, and the accelerating cosmos</i>.</p>
<p>The discovery of the acceleration of the expansion of the universe is one of the most surprising results of 20th century astrophysics. Around 1916, Albert Einstein famously introduced a "cosmological constant" to make his equations fit a static universe. In the 1930s, the work of Edwin Hubble and others showed that we live in an expanding universe, leading Einstein to call the cosmological constant his "greatest blunder." But in the 1990s, astronomers began to develop sharp tools for accurately measuring the history of comic expansion over the past 5 billion years. Observations of supernovae (exploding stars used to measure cosmological distances) showed that the universe is not just expanding, but that the expansion is speeding up. Cosmologists attribute this astonishing fact to the presence of "dark energy," which may be a modern form of the cosmological constant.</p>
<p>Kirshner's work on the acceleration of the universe with the "High-Z Supernova Team" helped lead to the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded jointly to his students Adam Riess and Brian Schmidt and to Saul Perlmutter of Lawrence Berkeley Lab. Kirshner and the High-Z Team shared in the Gruber Prize for Cosmology in 2007 and the Fundamental Physics Breakthrough Prize in 2014. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1998 and the American Philosophical Society in 2004.</p>
<p>The Mandel Lecture Series, generously sponsored by Steve Mandel and Carol Foote, promotes public awareness and appreciation for astronomy.

<p>The grant from NIH's <a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/orip/diic/high_end_instrumentation">High End Instrumentation program</a> funds the acquisition of a new Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer for the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://nmr.ucsc.edu/Home.html">NMR Facility</a>. With much higher magnetic field and sensitivity than the facility's other spectrometers, the new instrument is crucial for the elucidation of the structures of complex biomolecules, said Ilan Benjamin, professor and chair of chemistry and biochemistry.</p>
<p>Six UC Santa Cruz faculty scientists make extensive use of NMR spectroscopy in their NIH-funded research projects. Work in these labs addresses issues related to cancer biology, neurodegenerative diseases, drug development, infectious diseases, and the molecular machinery of circadian rhythms.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Strong user base</strong></p>
<p>"We have a remarkably strong user base, and I think part of the appeal of our proposal was the wide range of important, health-related applications that critically depend on high-end NMR spectroscopy," said Glenn Millhauser, distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry and principal investigator for the proposal. In addition, the NMR Facility recently hired a new manager, Jack Lee, Ph.D., through a national search, providing excellent support for the new instrument.</p>
<p>Millhauser said the NIH High End Instrumentation grants are offered nationwide every other year and are very competitive. "I'm beyond thrilled," he said. "This grant speaks to the visibility and importance of the research in NMR structural biology at UC Santa Cruz."</p>
<p>Based on the same principles as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique for analyzing molecular structures and identifying chemical compounds. The UC Santa Cruz NMR facility currently houses two older instruments and one modern 600 MHz NMR spectrometer that now runs at near full capacity. The NIH grant allows the purchase of a new, more powerful 800 MHz NMR spectrometer that will complement the existing instruments.</p>
<p>"Really high-end instruments like this are rare and often limited to regional facilities, and in the past we have had to travel to other institutions to use them," Millhauser said. "That's a serious problem if you have samples that aren't stable, or if you want to make adjustments to your samples and examine the responses. There are a lot of things you can't do if you have to travel to a regional facility, so this new spectrometer will greatly accelerate our research."</p>
<p>In addition to the $2 million NIH grant, significant contributions to cover the total cost of the spectrometer (about $2.5 million) were provided by the Office of Research, Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0b62ad7a807270173df02958dd9d0394"><name>bike-to-work-week</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Bike to Work Week activities</title><summary>UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) has joined with Ecology Action to host the 28th annual Santa Cruz County Spring Bike Week, May 4 - 8, 2015. </summary><start-date>1430377200000</start-date><display-name>Bike to Work Week activities</display-name><path>/2015/04/bike-to-work-week</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/bike-to-work-week</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1430415125806</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1430415392089</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><big><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) has joined with Ecology Action to host the 28th annual Santa Cruz County Spring Bike Week, May 4 - 8, 2015.

<p>The 8th in the world position is a three-place jump from number 11 where the study has ranked UC Santa Cruz in each of the past two years. <br/><br/>The campus ranks at the top (100 percentile) in the key citation index that measures the influence of an institution's research.<br/><br/>Times Higher Education&#160;uses the same range of 13 performance indicators to rank institutions for its "100 under 50" as it uses for its World University Rankings, a list on which UCSC ranked 109. There, UCSC ranked first in the world for research influence, tied with MIT.<br/><br/>Citation index measures a university's research influence by the number of times its published works are cited by scholars across the globe. The data are drawn from the 12,000 academic journals indexed by Thomson Reuters' Web of Science database and include all indexed journals published between 2008 and 2012.<br/><br/>The research influence indicator, weighted at 30 percent of the overall score, is the single most influential and looks at the role of universities in spreading new knowledge and ideas.<br/><br/>"The citations help show us how much each university is contributing to the sum of human knowledge: they tell us whose research has stood out, has been picked up and built on by other scholars and, most importantly, has been shared around the global scholarly community to push further the boundaries of our collective understanding, irrespective of discipline,"&#160;<em>THE</em>&#160;said in explaining the methodology. <br/><br/>THE&#160;said it reduces the weight of subjective indicators for academic reputation and prestige for the younger universities, reasoning that older universities have more time to build a reputation with deeper, wider, "and more established alumni networks with graduates more likely to hold senior positions in universities and society at large, all of which can bolster their reputations."<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz and UC Irvine, both founded in 1965, were the only U.S. universities to rank in the top dozen overall on the "100 under 50." Irvine was seventh, the same place it was ranked a year ago. &#201;cole Polytechnique F&#233;d&#233;rale de Lausanne in Switzerland was ranked first.<br/><br/>The principal criteria&#160;THE&#160;uses are:<br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Research: volume, income and reputation (30 percent);<br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Citations: research influence; (30 percent);<br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Teaching: the learning environment (30 percent)<br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; International outlook: people and research (7.5 percent);<br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Industry income: innovation (2.5 percent)<br/><br/>Times Higher Education is&#160;a weekly British magazine based in London reporting specifically on news and other issues related to higher education.

<div><br/> We are pleased to announce that after an extensive review and procurement process, the campus has selected&#160;Everbridge (<a href="http://www.everbridge.com">http://www.everbridge.com</a>) to provide this new system. Everbridge has been in use at UC Riverside&#160;for several years and is in use at many other major universities, cities, counties, and private corporations&#160;throughout the country. Implementation of the Everbridge system on campus is beginning this week, and the&#160;system is expected to be operational by early June.<br/> <br/> Everbridge will replace the current system that has been in place since 2008 and will allow for improved&#160;functionality and capabilities. Everbridge will be used for the following notification processes:<br/> <br/> &#8226; Immediate notifications (referred to on campus as CruzAlerts), which are issued during ongoing&#160;emergency situations affecting all or part of the campus and where specific actions are required for safety.&#160;CruzAlerts are issued via text message and other methods.<br/> &#8226; Timely warnings (referred to on campus as Community Crime Bulletins) are issued following the&#160;occurrence of specific crimes or patterns of crime as specified in the Clery Act. Timely warnings are more&#160;advisory in nature than CruzAlerts and are distributed via campus email.</div>
<div><br/> Implementation of Everbridge will include two phases. In the initial phase, existing contact data will be loaded&#160;into the new system and tested to ensure functionality before the current system is deactivated. In advance of&#160;this, please update your CruzAlert contact information if necessary by mid-May at&#160;<a href="http://cruzalert.ucsc.edu">http://cruzalert.ucsc.edu</a>.&#160;Following the first phase, OES and ITS staff will begin working on upgrades to the current registration process to&#160;take advantage of the additional capabilities of Everbridge.</div>
<div></div>
More information about the status of this project and both phases of implementation will be posted on the OES&#160;website at&#160;<a href="http://emergency.ucsc.edu">http://emergency.ucsc.edu</a>&#160;and the CruzAlert website as it becomes available.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chris Gaylord, Director of Emergency Management</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="20dedc09807270173df02958d492a367"><name>police-policies</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Formal Review &amp; Employee Comment: Universitywide Police Policies &amp; Administrative Procedures</title><summary>The University of California is proposing revisions to the Universitywide Police Policies and Administrative Procedures, which are applicable to UC Peace Officers.</summary><start-date>1430722800000</start-date><display-name>Formal Review &amp; Employee Comment: Universitywide Police Policies &amp; Administrative Procedures</display-name><path>/2015/04/police-policies</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/04/police-policies</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1430775585712</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1430775690126</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California is proposing revisions to the Universitywide Police Policies and Administrative Procedures, which are applicable to UC Peace Officers.</p>

<p>Language lecturer Miriam Ellis planted the seeds for the playhouse in 1972 when she started offering a program of theater and music in French at UCSC.</p>
<p>Now, the many fans of this program can get ready for another round of full-staged pieces.</p>
<p>Four public performances will be held on May 14,15,16,17, at 8 PM at the Stevenson Event Center at the UC Santa Cruz campus. This will include works in French, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish, with English super-titles. All pieces, in all five languages, will be performed every night. The program will be directed by Language lecturers. There is no admission charge, with nearby parking available for $4.</p>
<p>This year's works include: in French, <i>The Gap</i> by Eug&#232;ne Ionesco, and a scene from <i>The Would-Be Gentleman</i> by Moli&#232;re, directed by Miriam Ellis;&#160; in Italian<i>, Brother ATM</i> and <i>Serendipity</i>, by Stefano&#160; Benni, directed by Giulia Centineo; in Japanese, <i>Sweet Poison,</i> a traditional piece, directed by Sakae Fujita; in Russian, <i>The Patient</i>, by Serguey&#160; Dovlatov, directed by Natalya Samokhina;&#160; in Spanish, <i>Miseria</i>, by Ricardo G&#252;iraldes, directed by Marta Navarro.</p>
<p>The pieces range in time from medieval and classical periods to modern-day theater, with emphasis on their comic elements.&#160; The Playhouse puts a special emphasis on liveliness, humor, dramatic impact, and authenticity. &#8220;Through its diversity, we try to demonstrate the similarity of human experience in different cultures,&#8221; Ellis said.</p>
<p>Over the years, the International Playhouse presentations have attracted a loyal following. Many community members, as well as faculty and students from high schools and Cabrillo College, attend regularly. The English titles make the material easily accessible to audiences, who are afforded a rare multicultural experience by the diversity of the programs.</p>

<p>The 8th in the world position is a three-place jump from number 11 where the study has ranked UC Santa Cruz in each of the past two years. <br/><br/>The campus ranks at the top (100 percentile) in the key citation index that measures the influence of an institution's research.<br/><br/>Times Higher Education&#160;uses the same range of 13 performance indicators to rank institutions for its "100 under 50" as it uses for its World University Rankings, a list on which UCSC ranked 109. There, UCSC ranked first in the world for research influence, tied with MIT.<br/><br/>Citation index measures a university's research influence by the number of times its published works are cited by scholars across the globe. The data are drawn from the 12,000 academic journals indexed by Thomson Reuters' Web of Science database and include all indexed journals published between 2008 and 2012.<br/><br/>The research influence indicator, weighted at 30 percent of the overall score, is the single most influential and looks at the role of universities in spreading new knowledge and ideas.<br/><br/>"The citations help show us how much each university is contributing to the sum of human knowledge: they tell us whose research has stood out, has been picked up and built on by other scholars and, most importantly, has been shared around the global scholarly community to push further the boundaries of our collective understanding, irrespective of discipline,"&#160;<em>THE</em>&#160;said in explaining the methodology. <br/><br/>THE&#160;said it reduces the weight of subjective indicators for academic reputation and prestige for the younger universities, reasoning that older universities have more time to build a reputation with deeper, wider, "and more established alumni networks with graduates more likely to hold senior positions in universities and society at large, all of which can bolster their reputations."<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz and UC Irvine, both founded in 1965, were the only U.S. universities to rank in the top dozen overall on the "100 under 50." Irvine was seventh, the same place it was ranked a year ago. &#201;cole Polytechnique F&#233;d&#233;rale de Lausanne in Switzerland was ranked first.<br/><br/>The principal criteria&#160;THE&#160;uses are:<br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Research: volume, income and reputation (30 percent);<br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Citations: research influence; (30 percent);<br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Teaching: the learning environment (30 percent)<br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; International outlook: people and research (7.5 percent);<br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Industry income: innovation (2.5 percent)<br/><br/>Times Higher Education is&#160;a weekly British magazine based in London reporting specifically on news and other issues related to higher education.
