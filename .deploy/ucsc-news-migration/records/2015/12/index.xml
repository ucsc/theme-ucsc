<p>Founding director Pascale Garaud, professor of applied mathematics and statistics at UC Santa Cruz, said the six-week program combines the concept of a long-term workshop with graduate student training through research projects. Senior faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students will share ideas and work together on collaborative projects. Applications are now open for the 2016 program, which runs from June 20 to July 29.</p>
<p>Garaud, who started the program in 2010 as the International Summer Institute for Modeling in Astrophysics (ISIMA), said she is excited about the new partnership with the <a href="http://www.kavlifoundation.org/">Kavli Foundation</a>, which is providing $70,000 to support the 2016 program.</p>
<p>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of the UCSC Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, expressed his commitment to making the program a landmark component of the department. "We are delighted to host this transformative program, which reflects Pascale's unique vision for excellence in theoretical astrophysics," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Exoplanetary atmospheres</strong></p>
<p>Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and scientific director of the 2016 program on exoplanetary atmospheres, said it will cover a full spectrum of research topics for a wide range of planets.</p>
<p>"Exoplanetary science has tremendously expanded the scope of our thinking about what atmospheres can be made of, what kinds of planets can have or even lose atmospheres, and how we should best detect and characterize them," Fortney said. "Today we are confronting a host of issues far beyond our solar system experience and intuition."</p>
<p>The program will begin with a one-week workshop featuring introductory lectures by invited faculty and short contributed presentations. Innovative research projects for students will be developed during informal discussions and designated sessions, and students will team up with senior participants to work on their selected projects over the next five weeks of the program.</p>
<p>The location of future programs will alternate between UC Santa Cruz and other institutions worldwide. Previous programs have been held in Beijing, Toronto, and Santa Cruz. Garaud said the programs have been productive and have helped many participants make connections that led to postdoctoral positions and other opportunities. One of the participants in the Beijing program on star and planet formation, Xi Zhang, is now an assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"We have had some great success stories," Garaud said. "I participated in a similar program in fluid dynamics as a graduate student, and that program was the single most valuable experience in my career, shaping the scientist I am today. I wanted to give students in astrophysics the same opportunity."</p>

They&#8217;ll spend the morning working at whatever the season demands: planting, harvesting, pruning, making compost, or packing crops for the campus dining halls.</p>
<p>The interns are part of an evolving effort by UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) to integrate undergraduates into the seasonal work of the campus&#8217;s 33 acres of organic farmland and market gardens. With support from the Clarence E. Heller Foundation and a U.S. Department of Education Higher Education Challenge Grant, CASFS staff and UCSC faculty have crafted an internship program that complements the environmental studies major&#8217;s new concentration in agroecology and sustainable food systems.</p>
<p><strong>Food systems focus</strong></p>
<p>Beginning this fall, environmental studies majors are able to add a concentration in agroecology and sustainable food systems to their undergraduate major. The major academic objective is to provide students with a depth of expertise within the environmental studies major. Students will learn about ecological concepts that can be applied to the development of sustainable agricultural systems and will also develop their understanding of social, political, and economic aspects of agriculture. Students will also have access to hands-on experiences, and obtain skills in research, fieldwork, production, and communication.</p>
<p>Internships aren&#8217;t a new concept for CASFS; UCSC students have been seeking opportunities to get their hands dirty since Alan Chadwick arrived to start the Student Garden Project (now the Alan Chadwick Garden) nearly 50 years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s new about this internship program,&#8221; said Stacy Philpott, environmental studies associate professor and CASFS interim executive director,&#8220; is the coordination, and &#8216;scaffold&#8217; programming. We hope interns will take a two- or five-unit internship for a few quarters to take in some basic information, and then those students who are really engaged will continue to do individual project-based senior internships, or be hired as student assistant field managers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interns in the program spend three four-hour sessions a week working on UCSC&#8217;s organic farm. They also discuss readings about sustainable agriculture and meet with their faculty sponsor to talk about how the internship may help them shape their career interests.</p>
<p><strong>Adding context to the classroom</strong></p>
<p>Darryl Wong, a CASFS farm manager and instructor, sees the internship as a way to give students a broader context for their classroom education. &#8220;It provides hands-on experiences in the concepts they learn about in many of their environmental studies classes, things like water quality, soil biology, pest and disease issues, and biodiversity,&#8221; Wong said. &#8220;Our focus is for them to be moving and learning to support the academics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as important, he says, is to provide students with a realistic sense of what it takes to produce food. &#8220;Especially these days we&#8217;re bombarded with glossy media about how sexy and romantic organic farming is. When the students see what&#8217;s involved, they understand the real work that goes into it &#8212; the knowledge and skill set it requires as well as the physical demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chance to work outside is what attracts many interns to the program, which accepts up to 25 students per quarter. Environmental studies student Miguel Pe&#241;a said he sought out the internship because, &#8220;I knew it would serve as a venue for experiential learning. The ability to practice what one learns is important to me because it helps solidify my knowledge on the given subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of the teaching takes place in a question and answer format as the students work alongside CASFS farm and garden managers. &#8220;Today, for example, we were laying plastic mulch for next year&#8217;s strawberry crop,&#8221; said current intern Charlotte O&#8217;Brien, a junior. &#8220;We were able to ask about why we were preparing the beds that way, why a crop rotation was important, what diseases were a problem. For me, it&#8217;s a lot more effective than sitting in a classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Veronica Thao, a 2014 intern, echoes that thought. &#8220;The internship helped me to better understand the material I was learning in my classes because I was actually out there experiencing some of the work myself.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Delivering real food</strong></p>
<p>That work includes being part of a team of undergraduates who plant, grow, harvest, and deliver organic food to their own dining halls and to supply a weekly &#8220;pop-up&#8221; produce stand in the heart of campus. For students it creates a direct connection to the campus food system, and as Wong explains, &#8220;It&#8217;s helping to meet the goals of the campus&#8217;s Real Food Challenge,&#8221; a commitment to source 40 percent of UCSC Dining&#8217;s food from local, sustainable sources by 2020.</p>
<p>Interns also plug into ongoing research projects taking place at the CASFS Farm, including current research on organic alternatives to soil fumigants for growing strawberries, and a study on root maggots in organic cropping systems. &#160;</p>
<p>The internship revolves around the seasonal work at the CASFS Farm and Alan Chadwick Garden. In spring, interns spend time in the greenhouses, and prepare and plant beds; in the fall they harvest and pack crops for delivery to UCSC&#8217;s dining halls and sow cover crop seeds, and in the winter they pitch in with fruit tree care and making compost.</p>
<p>Damian Parr, education coordinator for CASFS, says the internship program is designed to complement the annual Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, a six-month, full-time residential training in organic farming and gardening offered by CASFS.</p>
<p>In place for nearly five decades, the apprenticeship has laid the groundwork for the thriving educational and research farm and gardens that are available to UCSC students and faculty. Interns benefit by working directly with the CASFS apprenticeship instructors, who have decades of experience in teaching both the theory and practice of agroecology and sustainable agriculture, as well as a background in what it takes to grow organic food on a commercial scale.</p>
<p>Thanks in large part to the apprenticeship, the environmental studies students who are drawn to the campus&#8217;s farm and gardens, and UCSC&#8217;s ground-breaking agroecology research and education efforts, the campus is a leader in agricultural studies and training despite its lack of land grant status or a formal agriculture major. Parr received funding from the University of California&#8217;s Global Food Initiative to document best practices for experiential learning to share with other universities and colleges.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding opportunities</strong></p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s reputation as a center for sustainable agriculture drew Mike McDonald, now a senior environmental studies major, from his home in Bethlehem, Penn. &#8220;I'd heard great things about UCSC's agriculture education from friends and strangers all across the country, and I knew this was where I wanted to complete my undergraduate studies,&#8221; McDonald said. &#8220;The CASFS internship gave me time outdoors learning new skills, and opened doors for new opportunities I hadn't even considered. My expectations were high, but the internship still exceeded them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ryan Duncans, a senior, shares a similar story. &#8220;I was working at an organic learning center at Santa Monica Community College,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When people heard that I was interested in sustainable agriculture they pointed me to UCSC. &#8220;</p>
<p>Duncans found the internship to be a good way to combine his class work with the practical workings of the farm and gardens. &#8220;Being on a functioning farm and garden and seeing food being produced by people who really knew how to do it was the best part for me. I hadn&#8217;t worked with people with those sorts of skills and in a setting with this intensity of food production.&#8221;</p>
<p>McDonald and Duncans are both part of the first class of environmental studies majors who will graduate with the new concentration in agroecology and sustainable food systems as part of their transcripts.&#160; And they&#8217;ve both benefited from the &#8220;pipeline&#8221; effect of the internship, with McDonald now working with Philpott&#8217;s research group, where he&#8217;s helping with a garden-based biodiversity study, and Duncans landing a job as a student farm manager.</p>
<p><strong>Careers and engagement</strong></p>
<p>For senior Eric Brunschweiler, the internship also led to a job on the campus farm and solidified his plans to make farming a career. &#8220;I've been working as a student manager with Darryl [Wong] and Kirstin [Yogg], and have been rising early to set gopher traps, run irrigation sets, and harvest to meet dining hall orders. I wouldn't have been hired if I hadn't interned for two quarters, and neither would I be as sure about where I want to take the rest of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parr envisions that the CASFS internship will continue to evolve, and with 40 or more students per quarter interested in the program it&#8217;s clear that student demand for such opportunities is strong.&#160; &#8220;We provide one of the best chances to get field experience in both production and research,&#8221; says Parr. &#8220;We&#8217;re now moving toward more upper division internships and senior exit internships as we build the capacity at the introductory level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wong acknowledges that although only a minority of interns is likely to pursue a career in agriculture, he sees the chance to expose students to the realities of farming as a critical way to create a more informed and engaged populace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever fields our interns enter, we&#8217;re giving them a way to link policy with practice and a larger understanding of agriculture&#8217;s impacts,&#8221; Wong said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://envs.ucsc.edu/undergraduate/prog-reqs/</url><title>Agroecology internships</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5ec303f08072701704be48b560a9b317"><name>music-center-energy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus creates 'smart' building, reducing carbon footprint</title><summary>The Music Center has reduced its carbon footprint by 98 tons, an example of the commitment by staff members to work across divisions to improve campus sustainability and efficiency. </summary><keywords>carbon, music center, smart building</keywords><start-date>1448985600000</start-date><display-name>Cutting carbon</display-name><path>/2015/12/music-center-energy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/12/music-center-energy</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1448993811620</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1448996713354</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/val-equipment-panel-500px.JPG</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/val-equipment-panel-500px.JPG</link><site>news</site><name>val-equipment-panel-500px.JPG</name><display-name>val-equipment-panel-500px.JPG</display-name><file-size>74774</file-size><width>497</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Valentin Berrelleza Berumen</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/music-center-energy-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/music-center-energy-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>music-center-energy-80px.jpg</name><display-name>music-center-energy-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>7941</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Music Center Recital Hall</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Valentin Berrelleza Berumen, BMS programmer, worked to install and fine-tune the new technology.</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/staff-collaboration-500px.JPG</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/staff-collaboration-500px.JPG</link><site>news</site><name>staff-collaboration-500px.JPG</name><display-name>staff-collaboration-500px.JPG</display-name><file-size>73791</file-size><width>500</width><height>349</height></image><image-alt>Staff at Recital Hall</image-alt><image-caption>From left: Jeffrey Potter, Susan Gautieri, Sarah Gilchrist, Dave Morrison, and Dan Miceli</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has significantly cut the Music Center's energy use, part of a collaboration with PG&amp;E to make buildings more efficient.</p>
<p>The campus installed occupancy and carbon dioxide sensors to monitor the building's use so it is only heated and cooled as needed. The sensors are connected to a server that monitors energy usage to make sure the building is running efficiently.</p>
<p>This project is an example of the commitment by staff to work across divisions to improve campus sustainability and efficiency. The project was developed and implemented by the Physical Plant Building and Management System staff, led by senior superintendent Dan Miceli, and implemented by BMS controls technician Valentin Berrelleza Berumen.</p>
<p>The Music Center's building staff, particularly facilities manager Susan Gautieri and music production supervisor Dave Morrison, worked closely with the BMS team as the building houses highly sensitive musical instruments and equipment, and includes the Recital Hall, which seats 396 guests.</p>
<p>This kind of collaboration allowed the campus to significantly reduce its campus carbon footprint while maintaining the comfort and control needed for this sensitive space.</p>
<p>"The building lives, breathes, and reacts to its usage and needs," campus Energy Manager Patrick Testoni said. "This project is just one example of our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint by harnessing modern technology and working collaboratively across divisions and with our utility provider."</p>
<p>The project, completed in September 2014, resulted in a 19 percent reduction of electricity (91,000 annual kilowatt hours), a 44 percent reduction in natural gas usage (10,000 annual therms), and a 22 percent reduction in electrical demand (44kW hours) during peak hours.</p>
<p>All this adds up to an annual CO2 reduction of 98 tons, which is equal to approximately 45 homes in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>Additionally, the campus received a rebate check from PG&amp;E for nearly $32,000, helping offset the project's cost of the $150,000 project. Similar work was done at Earth and Marine Sciences, and Engineering 2.</p>
<p>"This the future of what we do," Testoni said. "There's a lot of wasted energy out there. This is about using less, not sacrificing our comfort."</p>
<p>The University of California, California State University, and California's four large investor-owned utilities (PG&amp;E, SDG&amp;E, SCE, and SoCalGas) established an energy efficiency partnership in 2004 in order to provide a sustainable and comprehensive energy management program for all 33 UC and CSU campuses.</p>
<p>Dan Miceli, senior superintendent and head of the Building Management Systems shop, and Valentin Berrelleza Berumen, BMS programmer, worked to install and fine-tune the new technology.</p>
<p>Other staff who worked on the project include:</p>

<li>Johnny Clifton, high voltage electrical engineer</li>
<li>Susan Gautieri, Music Center facilities manager</li>
<li>Dave Morrison, Music Production supervisor</li>

A hackathon is a coding marathon in which teams work together to create apps and programs that provide innovative solutions to a variety of social and business issues.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz and the City of Santa Cruz Economic Development Office are hosting and sponsoring the event this year, with UCSC's Division of Graduate Studies and its <a href="http://cied.ucsc.edu/">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development</a> (CIED) taking the lead.</p>
<p>"UC Santa Cruz is pleased to continue hosting, sponsoring, and strengthening the largest hackathon on the Central Coast. At UC Santa Cruz, we understand the importance of encouraging the development of solutions to real-world problems and the inclusion of a greater diversity of students in entrepreneurial opportunities through events like the hackathon," said Sue Carter, associate dean of graduate studies and CIED director. "UC Santa Cruz also values its vital economic relationship with the City of Santa Cruz, the flourishing local tech sector, and our partners throughout the Monterey Bay and Silicon Valley region which we serve."</p>
<p>Student participants in <a href="http://hackucsc.com/">Hack UCSC 2016</a> will form teams of up to five members. Teams have the option to include mentors (community business leaders) to help them design and build their programs over the course of the weekend. The teams will create apps in three categories: <strong>Innovation</strong>, which focuses on unique technical solutions; <strong>Tech Cares</strong>, which focuses on social good related to solving agricultural, environmental, or other community issues; and <strong>Labor Tech</strong>, sponsored by The Workers Lab to encourage students to use innovation to reduce income inequality and build sustainable solutions that help working people.</p>
<p><strong>Cash and prizes</strong></p>
<p>More than $80,000 in cash and prizes will be awarded to the top teams. On the afternoon of January 31, the apps will be judged on relevance, creativity, and technical merit. Prizes will be awarded to the top three teams in each category. In addition to cash and merchandise prizes, winners in the Tech Cares category will be able to grant a total of $4,000 to their favorite nonprofits by way of a sponsorship from Community Foundation Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>"As the tech ecosystem continues to thrive in the Santa Cruz Monterey Bay Area, Hack UCSC has become an essential synapse between the city and the university, fueling the more than 550 tech companies in Santa Cruz," said Bonnie Lipscomb, director of economic development for the City of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>UCSC alumni Doug Erickson and Mark Adams, organizers of the Santa Cruz New Tech MeetUp, have created the hackathon to help students develop their coding skills and connect with technology leaders in the community.</p>
<p>"Hack UCSC 2016 is bound to be another huge win for our communities," Erickson said. "At last year's event, we had a richly diverse attendance, including 22 percent females, attendees from eight different schools as far away as Mexico City, and media coverage even by the Huffington Post."</p>
<p>Leadership sponsors of the event include Nanigans and The Workers Lab. Business sponsors include Community Foundation Santa Cruz County, Santa Cruz New Tech MeetUp, and South Swell Ventures.</p>
<p>Participants are encouraged to discuss project ideas on the Hack UCSC 2016 Facebook page or can get more information at <a href="http://hackucsc.com/">hackucsc.com</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6026cee38072701704be48b5df5c76a9"><name>community-heroes-2015</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Three UC Santa Cruz affiliates named 'Community Heroes'</title><summary>Three people with UC Santa Cruz affiliations are among 18 local residents honored as Community Heroes by United Way of Santa Cruz County as part of its annual Community Assessment Project.  </summary><start-date>1449016200000</start-date><display-name>Community Heroes 2015</display-name><path>/2015/12/community-heroes-2015</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/12/community-heroes-2015</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1449017134778</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1449017785356</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/community_heroes_2015-550.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/community_heroes_2015-550.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>community_heroes_2015-550.jpg</name><display-name>community_heroes_2015-550.jpg</display-name><file-size>166503</file-size><width>550</width><height>366</height></image><image-alt>david robles, tamara ball, steve gliessman</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Shown with other Community Heroes at the United Way ceremony and press conference November 23 are UC Santa Cruz affiliates David Robles, third from left, Tamara Ball, second from right, and Steve Gliessman, right.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Three people with UC Santa Cruz affiliations are among 18 local residents honored as Community Heroes by United Way of Santa Cruz County as part of its annual Community Assessment Project.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Tamara Ball, David Robles, and Steve Gliessman were nominated by their peers and exemplify the accomplishment of the assessment project&#8217;s goals for economy, education, environment, health, public safety, and social environment, according to United Way.&#160;This is the 21<sup>st</sup> year that the charitable organization has conducted its Community Assessment Project and chosen community heroes.</p>
<p><strong>Tamara Ball</strong></p>
<p>Tamara Ball, a project scientist in UCSC&#8217;s electrical engineering department, has worked relentlessly to train undergraduate students in real-world, high-tech sustainability projects through her Impact Designs: Engineering and Sustainability (IDEASS) program that she launched in 2010.</p>
<p>Co-directed by James Barsimantov, who earned his Ph.D. in environmental studies at UCSC in 2008, IDEASS provides a unique educational experience during a three-quarter program where&#160; 25-35 students each year, from a wide range of majors, gain skills in project planning and management, and technical expertise through their work with an industry, non-profit or civic mentor.</p>
<p>Ball has been resourceful in obtaining quality staff, advisers, mentors, and funding for the program during difficult periods, leveraging relationships within and outside the university.</p>
<p><strong>David Robles</strong></p>
<p>David Robles devotes most of his life to the Center of Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) at UC Santa Cruz. Robles first came to work at the CASFS farm in fall 2012 when he enrolled as an undergraduate. During his tenure at the farm, he has displayed a tireless nature and deep dedication to caring for a farm that serves undergraduates and aspiring farmers and the Santa Cruz community through education, research and building food access by donating thousands of pounds of produce to people in need. His contributions have been integral to the farm&#8217;s health and sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Gliessman</strong></p>
<p>Steve Gliessman, joined the UC Santa Cruz environmental studies faculty and founded the UC Santa Cruz Agroecology Program in 1981. The next year he became holder of the first endowed chair at UC Santa Cruz, the Ruth and Alfred E. Heller Chair in Agroecology.</p>
<p>Gliessman formally retired in 2010 but remains active in the field of agroecolgy and sustainable food. He continues as editor of the journal <em>Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.</em></p>
<p>Agroecology, as Gliessman defines it, is an approach to life based on treating the land in an ecologically sound way. It must also encompass a just system socially and economically that treats people, land, animals, and water in &#8220;a way that lasts forever,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about healthy food, healthy land, and healthy people,&#8221; Gliessman says. The goal &#8220;is to create transformative action and a whole new way of thinking about the entire food system.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.appliedsurveyresearch.org/scccap</url><title>2015 Community Assessment Project</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="63bcc4a48072701704be48b5dc9d2f92"><name>exceptions-to-closure</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Exceptions to Campus Closure 2015-2016</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz campus will close during the holiday season in an effort to conserve energy at a time when university business is generally slow.</summary><start-date>1449043200000</start-date><display-name>Exceptions to Campus Closure </display-name><path>/2015/12/exceptions-to-closure</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/12/exceptions-to-closure</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1449077294208</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1449077309914</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As in the past, the UC Santa Cruz campus will close during the holiday season in an effort to conserve energy at a time when university business is generally slow. This year the campus will be closed from Thursday, December 24, 2015 through &#8203;Fri&#8203;day, January &#8203;1&#8203;, 2016, returning to normal building operations &#8203; Saturday&#8203;, January &#8203;2&#8203;, 2016.<br/>
<br/>
 The campus community is reminded to turn off lights, shut down computers and other office equipment, and close and lock exterior windows before leaving for the break.<br/>
<br/>
 During the closure some housing areas and other buildings will remain open. Laboratory buildings will be partially operational due to special needs of researchers and scientists, and some campus units&#8217; work schedules may require staffing during all or part of the closure. Fire, police, and environmental health and safety services will be provided to the campus community during this period, along with necessary utilities and other essential services.<br/>
<br/>
 If you are required to work all or part of this closure, you must receive approval from your unit head and principal officer. Once unit heads have concurrence from their principal officer, they are asked to notify Physical Plant directly of their plans to remain open or staffed during part or all of the closure. Notifications should be made via email to <a href="mailto:pahelm@ucsc.edu">pahelm@ucsc.edu</a>, by campus mail to Melody Pahel, Physical Plant at Barn G, or by fax (9-5121,) no later than &#8203;Wednesday, December 16, 2015, and should include the specific dates that offices will be occupied, as well as the number of occupants. This will ensure that open areas will receive necessary services during this period when most faculty, staff, and students are gone.<br/>
<br/>
 It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time. Unit heads should also notify their appropriate SHR partner for time and payroll accounting purposes. Faculty is urged to announce the closure broadly to their graduate students who may plan on working throughout the closures.<br/>
<br/>
 If you have facilities-related questions or would like further information on campus closure exceptions, please contact Melody Pahel at 9-5561.</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Exceptions to Campus Closure 2015-2016</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="63fa060b8072701704be48b5760d287d"><name>climate-conference-declaration</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Declaration of human rights added to discussions at UN Climate Change Conference</title><summary>As world leaders gather this week in Paris for the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, a group of environmental and legal scholars including S.

Ravi Rajan helped draft human rights resolution</article-subhead><article-text><p>As world leaders gather this week in Paris for the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, a group of environmental and legal scholars including S. Ravi Rajan of UC Santa Cruz has drafted a resolution stating human rights must be more explicitly acknowledged during climate discussions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe climate discourse has by and large ignored human rights dimensions,&#8221; said Rajan, associate professor of environmental studies, and a member of a committee from the <a href="http://gnhre.org">Global Network for the Study of Environmental Human Rights</a> that has drafted a joint <a href="http://gnhre.org/gnhre-draft-declaration/draft-declaration-on-human-rights-and-climate-change-2/">Declaration on Human Rights and Climate Change</a>.</p>
<p>This is the first time in the climate change debate that human rights, and the duties of states and companies will become part of the discussion, Rajan said. The draft declaration is now a formal document in the mix at Paris, he said.</p>
<p>Though previously ignored or overlooked, &#8220;human rights dimensions are obviously ever present,&#8221; Rajan said. &#8220;We therefore attempted to contribute to addressing this gap by explicitly drafting a framework that can be used to address this important issue.&#8221; Rajan is also a co-author of a longer paper that further builds on the issue. &#160;</p>
<p>Rajan, former provost at College Eight, joined UC Santa Cruz in 1997 and also serves on the board of Greenpeace International. His research addresses three broad themes: environmentally inclusive governance with a focus on the relationship between the environment and human rights, and on the environmental basis of poverty.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://gnhre.org/</url><title>Global Network for the Study of Environmental Human Rights</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://gnhre.org/gnhre-draft-declaration/draft-declaration-on-human-rights-and-climate-change-2/</url><title>Declaration on Human Rights and Climate Change</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6f1355908072701704be48b5ad0e2ac5"><name>stamp-film-academy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Film professor speaks at Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Hollywood</title><summary>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented a lecture by UC Santa Cruz film and digital media professor Shelley Stamp on December 3, at the Linwood Dunn Theater...</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, shelley stamp, lois weber, Acadmey of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</keywords><start-date>1449271200000</start-date><display-name>film professor speaks at Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</display-name><path>/2015/12/stamp-film-academy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/12/stamp-film-academy</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1449267516783</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1449272309977</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/weber-screen-lecture-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/weber-screen-lecture-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>weber-screen-lecture-400.jpg</name><display-name>weber-screen-lecture-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>116543</file-size><width>400</width><height>277</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz Film and Digital Media Professor Shelley Stamp at the Academy of Motion Pic</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/stamp-academy-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/stamp-academy-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stamp-academy-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>stamp-academy-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>36113</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa Cruz Film and Digital Media Professor Shelley Stamp at the Academy of Motion Pic</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>UC Santa Cruz Film and Digital Media Professor Shelley Stamp spoke about her new book, <em>Lois Weber in Early Hollywood</em>, at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences' Linwood Dunn Theater on Dec. 3.

<br/>
 The Academy Scholars presentation by Stamp--about her recently published book, <em>Lois Weber in Early Hollywood</em>--was followed by a screening of Weber&#8217;s 1916 film <em>Shoes</em>, with live musical accompaniment, from a print recently restored by the EYE Film Museum in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Based on a short story by Stella Wynne Herron, <em>Shoes</em> tells the plight of a young girl whose financial desperation leads her to prostitution.<br/>
<br/>
 Stamp&#8217;s book about Weber was published in April, and was recently included in a <em>Huffington Post</em> article about the best film books of 2015.<br/>
<br/>
 One of&#160;the most prolific directors of the silent film era, Weber was also a writer, producer, actress, and head of her own production company, who paved the way for filmmakers who envisioned film as an opportunity to inject their own ideas and philosophies into a rapidly growing entertainment industry.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Her work is incredibly interesting because she wrote and directed popular narratives in the 1910s that took on controversial subjects of the day--poverty, addiction, capital punishment, and the fight to legalize birth control,&#8221; said Stamp. &#8220;She believed cinema was a &#8216;voiceless language&#8217; capable of presenting these issues for a mass audience, a new medium on par with a newspaper's editorial page.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Stamp&#8217;s talk was the 13th in a series of lectures spotlighting recipients of the Academy Film Scholars grant.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/04/stamp-book-festival.html</url><title>Film professor to share research on Hollywood director at LA Times Festival of Books</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7d963cfe8072701704be48b55e1a1311"><name>game-design</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>First-in-family student pursues game design</title><summary>A freshman at UC Santa Cruz, Briana Sidney is the first in her family to attend college, and she's on the road to becoming a game designer.</summary><keywords>game design, briana sidney, oakland, ucop, </keywords><start-date>1449507600000</start-date><display-name>Game design</display-name><path>/2015/12/game-design</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/12/game-design</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1449510976734</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1449616478533</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computational Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Cheri O'Neil</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/briana-500px.JPG</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/briana-500px.JPG</link><site>news</site><name>briana-500px.JPG</name><display-name>briana-500px.JPG</display-name><file-size>64983</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Briana Sidney</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/briana-80px.JPG</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/briana-80px.JPG</link><site>news</site><name>briana-80px.JPG</name><display-name>briana-80px.JPG</display-name><file-size>10504</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Briana Sidney</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>A freshman at UC Santa Cruz, Briana Sidney is the first in her family to attend college, and she's on the road to becoming a game designer.

Her father taught her to play video games, which gave her a way to connect with him. Her favorites were "Madden NFL" and "Ape Escape."</p>
<p>By the time she was 12, video games grew in importance. They became her reward for getting good grades, and by 17, she realized they were her way to escape the violence of her neighborhood into worlds where she could control what happens.</p>
<p>Now a freshman at UC Santa Cruz, Sidney is the first in her family to attend college, and she's on the road to becoming a game designer.</p>
<p>Sitting with her laptop in the Stevenson Coffee House, she says, "I love to play ukulele and volleyball and sing in the choir. But what I'm always thinking about is programming."</p>
<p>Studies show that only one in 10 people from low-income families have a bachelor's degree by age 25. For those like Briana who do get to college, the transition can be made easier with the help of mentors.</p>
<p>And so it was with Sidney, who met her first mentor, Charity Clay, as a sophomore at Oakland High School. Clay was working with Juma Ventures, an organization that empowers low-income youth, and within a week after she met Sidney, the teen had turned in all her application materials for the program.</p>
<p>"I realized right away that Briana was a self-starter with a high level of autonomy," says Clay, PhD, now a sociology professor at Merritt College. "She's not afraid to fail, and she's not afraid to embrace trying something new."</p>
<p>In the Juma Ventures program, Sidney got a job as a food vendor at the Oakland Coliseum, and the program matched her earnings for college expenses. Later, Clay encouraged her to apply to Girls Who Code, a nonprofit working to close the gender gap in the technology industry. The summer after her junior year, Sidney took public transportation every day from Oakland to Menlo Park for the seven-week computer science program at Facebook's headquarters.</p>
<p>"The most life-changing part of Girls Who Code was seeing that the curriculum director of the program did not have perfect grades and was not the perfect student," Sidney says. "I got the impression I needed that to be a programmer. It turned out it was okay that I was not the best student in high school."</p>
<p>She also discovered a love for coding that summer, likening it to "solving a puzzle, challenging and rewarding."</p>
<p>During her senior year, Sidney had an internship with Tech Hive at the UC Berkeley Lawrence Hall of Science, followed by another at RADD3, a technology and software startup, where she taught others how to code using Code Academy.</p>
<p>It was through Tech Hive that she met research director Sherry Hsi, who describes Sidney as someone who has her own ideas and the determination to express them.</p>
<p>"She was in a design team assigned to create a responsive robotic animal using a cardboard, programmable motor, and sensors," Hsi says. "Most of the student teams created an animated animal as instructed. Not Bri. Instead of following directions, she and her team decided to make the house from the Pixar movie, 'Up,' with colorful animated balloons.</p>
<p>"During the project presentations, I said to her, 'So, this isn't an animal,' to which she replied, 'I know. But this is much more awesome, and so we made it. Isn't it great?'"</p>
<p>At UCSC, Sidney has a $5,000 scholarship as part of an initiative that aims to build a stronger partnership between UC's Office of the President and the Oakland community.</p>
<p>Her favorite games now are "Tomb Raider" and "The Last of Us." Eventually, she says, she'd love to work for a game company, but she'd also like to help introduce more children to science and technology.</p>
<p>"STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math education) fields can seem so intimidating, but I don't think it would be that way if they were introduced at a young age. As it is now, you have to have money and transportation to even visit a science museum, and that's not something everyone has. I'd love to send children there for an entire week."</p>
<p>And how do video games fit in to those dreams?</p>

Five awards have been made so far.</p>
<p>On January 8, five years will have passed since Zimmerman (Stevenson, &#8216;02, sociology) was shot and killed while working as community outreach director for U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). Five others died in the shooting rampage in Tucson; 13 were wounded, including Giffords.</p>
<p>Moved by Zimmerman&#8217;s commitment to public service, two UC Santa Cruz alums, Alex Clemens (Porter, '89, international politics) and Jonathan Klein (Merrill, '89, politics), created a scholarship fund in his honor.</p>
<p>Now, Professor Emeritus David E. Kaun, a founding faculty member in economics, has launched a matching challenge to add to the Zimmerman fund. Kaun said he will match up to $20,000 for any increased faculty and staff giving to any UCSC fund, adding the proceeds to the Zimmerman fund.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting community service</strong></p>
<p>The five Zimmerman scholarship winners to date are pursuing activities in social justice ranging from technology, medicine, and human rights. The most recent recipient is Elisabeth Parra (Merrill, &#8217;15, human biology and community studies) who wants to practice community medicine in Los Angeles, where she is from.</p>
<p>Parra is using her scholarship to attend UC Davis School of Medicine&#8217;s Postbaccalaureate Program, a one-year program that helps socio-economically disadvantaged students become competitive applicants to medical school.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is whole population with no access to medical services,&#8221; Parra says. &#160;&#8220;Undocumented and uninsured people are sick with nowhere to go. That&#8217;s who I want to work for.&#8221;</p>
<p>She says she could not have enrolled the program without the Zimmerman scholarship. &#8220;I want put power back into the the hands of people and community who need it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Legacy lives on</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Gabe would have been proud to be associated with the scholarship recipients,&#8221; said his classmate and close friend Neal Zeavy (Stevenson, &#8217;01, community studies). &#8220;They are remarkable people who certainly embody this legacy and make me hopeful that those in need in our society are being supported.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Gabe Zimmerman Scholarship is a way to carry on the legacy that Gabe embodied: to work to make the world a better place and to see the potential positive impact on an individual as being worthy of one's time.&#8221; Applications for the scholarship are due in early spring.</p>
<p>Other recipients include Samantha House (College Ten, &#8217;15, legal studies), Abuoali &#8220;Arash&#8221; Mohajerinejad (Oakes, &#8217;14, sociology), Carson Watts (Oakes, &#8217;13, sociology and politics), and <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/02/zimmerman-scholarship.html">Yethz&#233;ll D&#237;az (&#8217;12, Latin American and Latino studies and sociology)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Journey to justice</strong></p>
<p>As the inaugural recipient, D&#237;az said, &#8220;It was through discovering who Gabe was and what his story meant to so many who knew him that I understood that it was the journey towards social justice that was being celebrated. The scholarship helped me understand and see the value of being willing to pursue something that I believed in and the power of dedicated people to create meaningful change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, D&#237;az is working for ETR (Education, Training, Research) as a member of the Diversity in IT research team. ETR is a nonprofit that advances the work of health, education and social service providers through research, publications, training and programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my work now, the most important way I am making a difference is by building upon the hard work, sacrifices and values of the generations before me in order to ensure that voices from marginalized/underrepresented communities are represented in the work that informs the knowledge-formation process,&#8221; &#160;D&#237;az said.</p>
<p>Since 2014, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/04/zimmerman-scholarship.html">Carson Watts, the second Zimmerman Scholarship recipient</a>, works for TechSoup, a San Francisco startup that partners technology companies with nonprofits who need the technical support to tackle social problems. He recently started a new position in the company helping with NGOsource, a program that streamlines the international grantmaking process.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way,&#8221; Watts says about his commitment to working in the not-for-profit sector. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sit with myself if I wasn&#8217;t part of something to make the world a better place. It&#8217;s worth it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Inspiring political leadership</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/06/zimmerman-scholarship.html">2014 recipient Arash Mohajerinejad</a> says he is inspired by Zimmerman. &#8220;He was someone who gave his life for something he believed in.&#8221;</p>
<p>A dedicated human rights advocate, Mohajerinejad was forced to flee his native Iran in 2003 because of his political activism. Facing imprisonment, torture, and even death for his beliefs, Mohajerinejad escaped to London and eventually to the San Francisco bay area and UC Santa Cruz where he completed his undergraduate studies. &#160;</p>
<p>As a UCSC student, Mohajerinejad was active both on campus and in the community. He volunteered at the San Francisco County Jail, cooked for the Meals on Wheels program, advised students, and formed the Global Nuclear Awareness Coalition, a student organization.</p>
<p>Since graduating, Mohajerinejad remains committed to those causes. He is active with his local Lions Club where he helps financially and socially disadvantaged students, fundraises for the homeless, and assists the elderly.</p>
<p>In addition, he continues to promote human rights and secular democracy for Iran and the Middle East. He organizes protests across the globe through the International Alliance of Iranian Students and his own peer network.</p>
<p>Mohajerinejad is currently applying to law school and hopes to follow Zimmerman&#8217;s footsteps and work in local politics.</p>
<p>&#8220;He inspired me to think differently,&#8221; &#160;Mohajerinejad says.</p>
<p>Samantha House, a 2015 recipient, said, &#8220;Gabe passed while pursuing his passion as a dedicated public servant to social justice. Individuals like Gabe are to be valued in society, they evoke change and incite others to desire justice. If I can ensure that, if I can reincarnate Gabe&#8217;s views in my own life, then I am pursuing the right life.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/news-events/student-profiles/2015/yethell-diaz.html</url><title>In her words: Yethzéll Díaz</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/endowments/endowments-all/zimmerman/index.html</url><title>Information on applying</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=780&amp;dids=538&amp;_ga=1.13541175.1618983604.1397502801</url><title>Information on donating</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/01/Gabriel-Zimmerman-remembered.html</url><title>Alumnus Gabriel Zimmerman remembered for social conscience, consensus-building</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7e923c2b8072701704be48b5a8312ab9"><name>domhoff-video</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>How UC Santa Cruz became unique (in just over eight minutes)</title><summary>“How UC Santa Cruz Became Unique,” a snappy eight-minute history of UC Santa Cruz’s first 50 years and its effect on the town, has been produced by founding faculty member G.

 <br/>
 The book examines the dispersal of African captives throughout the Americas after their initial arrival from Africa.<br/>
 <br/>
 The UC Santa Cruz historian traveled to Little Rock, Arkansas, in November to pick up his most recent award, the <strong>2015 Frank L. and Harriet C. Owsley Award</strong> from the Southern Historical Association, in recognition of &#8220;the most distinguished book in southern history published in 2014.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 This past summer, he flew to the Bahamas to pick up the <strong>2015&#160;Elsa Goveia Book Prize in Caribbean History</strong>. Given by the Association of Caribbean Historians, this award is presented once every two years for the best book (in English, Spanish, French, or Dutch) in the field of Caribbean history. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;O&#8217;Malley transforms our understanding of the dynamics of the slave trade in the New World and redraws the map of the final destinations of forced African immigrants during the slave trade era,&#8221; noted the Elsa Goveia Book Prize committee. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;It is a major contribution both to the history of slavery, the African diaspora, and to the history of trans-Atlantic and inter-Caribbean commerce during the 17th and the 18th centuries.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 In October, it was also announced that O&#8217;Malley won two separate awards for the book from the American Historical Association (AHA), the oldest and largest society of historians and professors of history in the United States. <br/>
 <br/>
 He received the AHA&#8217;s <strong>2015&#160;James A. Rawley Prize in Atlantic History</strong>, offered annually &#8220;to recognize outstanding historical writing that explores aspects of integration of Atlantic worlds before the 20th century.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 He was also honored with the AHA&#8217;s <strong>2015&#160;Morris D. Forkosch Prize</strong>, offered annually in recognition of the best book in English in the field of British, British imperial, or British Commonwealth history since 1485.<br/>
 <br/>
 O&#8217;Malley&#8217;s book draws on a database of more than 7,000 intercolonial slave trading voyages compiled from port records, newspapers, and merchant accounts to identify and quantify the major routes of the intercolonial slave trade.<br/>
 <br/>
 He documents that these voyages were a crucial component in the development of slavery in the Caribbean and North America and that &#8220;trade in the unfree led to experimentation with free trade between empires.&#8221;<br/>

 According to the W<em>illiam and Mary Quarterly</em>, the premier journal for colonial American history: &#8220;With the publication of <em>Final Passages</em>, the historiography of the intra-American slave trade has made a giant leap forward.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/Gregory-OMalley-True-Original-295by128.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/Gregory-OMalley-True-Original-295by128.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Gregory-OMalley-True-Original-295by128.jpg</name><display-name>Gregory-OMalley-True-Original-295by128.jpg</display-name><file-size>12400</file-size><width>295</width><height>128</height></thumb><thumb-alt>GREGORY O'MALLEY</thumb-alt><title>GREGORY O'MALLEY</title><description>Associate professor of history won four awards in 2015 for his groundbreaking book "Final Passages: The Intercolonial Slave Trade of British America, 1619-1807."</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7ecfb2568072701704be48b5e3309677"><name>latham-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cool Campus Challenge is just the beginning</title><summary>By Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services – UC Santa Cruz, one of the smaller campuses, has had great participation in the Cool Campus Challenge with more than 1,400 people signing up.</summary><start-date>1449531000000</start-date><display-name>Sarah Latham keynote</display-name><path>/2015/12/latham-keynote</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/12/latham-keynote</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1449531519538</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1449531989623</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Sarah Latham</name><title>Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services</title><phone/><email>sclatham@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/12/images/latham_sarah-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/12/images/latham_sarah-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>latham_sarah-300.jpg</name><display-name>latham_sarah-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>103456</file-size><width>300</width><height>203</height></image><image-alt>Sarah Latham</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Sarah Latham, vice chancellor, business and administrative services</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In October, UC Santa Cruz joined the systemwide <a href="http://www.coolcampuschallenge.org/">Cool Campus Challenge</a>, a competition between the UC campuses to fight climate change by reducing our collective carbon footprint. Throughout the UC system, participants are making pledges and recording their actions to accumulate points. At the end of the day on December 10, the campus with the most points wins.</p>
<p>But really, every campus&#8212;and all of us&#8212;will be winners, because the Cool Campus Challenge is a fun way to encourage everyone to become mindful stewards of our environment and help ensure our planet is healthy for generations to come.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz is one of the smaller campuses, but we have had a great rate of participation with more than 1,400 people signing up. This is a testament to your passion&#8212;and if you haven't joined, there's still time for you to <a href="http://www.coolcampuschallenge.org/">sign up</a> and earn points. As an added incentive, we're raffling off a Momentum bicycle, and each participant on our campus with more than 10,000 points will be eligible to win.</p>
<p>The Cool Campus Challenge is one of many systemwide efforts to reduce UC's carbon footprint. In 2013, President Janet Napolitano announced a carbon neutrality initiative that commits the university to emitting net zero building and vehicle fleet gases by 2025. This commitment is a first for any major university system. Last month, the university joined the <a href="http://www.breakthroughenergycoalition.com/en/index.html">Breakthrough Energy Coalition</a> led by Bill Gates, which is investing in technology to address climate change.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, we have established a robust strategic energy program. We identify and implement energy efficiency projects and receive deep rate reductions from PG&amp;E that help subsidize these projects. This program has enabled the campus to reduce its emissions by 15 percent over the past eight years.</p>
<p>One of our newest carbon reduction initiatives is our Climate and Energy Strategy. This is a year-long collaborative study that will help us identify the most cost-effective, impactful strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. As part of this, we are auditing energy use in 50 of our most energy intensive buildings on campus to identify carbon reduction measures that can be implemented through our partnership with PG&amp;E. It also includes a renewable energy feasibility study that is focused mainly on solar photovoltaics; we want to identify all possible locations throughout campus where solar is feasible.&#160;</p>
<p>While much has been done, a lot of work remains. It will take each and every member of our community to meet our carbon neutrality goal. I look forward to partnering with you on this work. In the meantime, I encourage you to join the Cool Campus Challenge!</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="82b5d46b8072701704be48b596dbb985"><name>water-saving</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Marine lab water projects lead to significant savings</title><summary>The Long Marine Lab has recorded a significant drop in freshwater use since two projects were completed in August.</summary><keywords>water saving, long marine lab, freshwater, pumps</keywords><start-date>1449594000000</start-date><display-name>Water saving</display-name><path>/2015/12/water-saving</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/12/water-saving</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1449596933180</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1450290005966</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/water-saving-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/water-saving-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>water-saving-500px.jpg</name><display-name>water-saving-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>70025</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Randolph Skrovan</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/water-saving-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/water-saving-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>water-saving-80px.jpg</name><display-name>water-saving-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>9147</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Water pump</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Long Marine Lab facilities manager Randolph Skrovan with some of the pumps that are now flushed with seawater, savingas much as 2 million gallons of freshwater a year.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The lab has been able to use seawater instead of freshwater for flushing pump seals and washing animal platforms</article-subhead><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Long Marine Lab's switch to using saltwater to rinse mammal decks and to flush pump seals should save the campus roughly 2 million gallons per year.</p>
<p>"The campus was clear about wanting to save as much water as possible during this historic drought," said Steve Davenport, managing director for the Long Marine Lab. "We got that message at the lab and began looking at innovative ways we might cut our potable water use."</p>
<p>Davenport and Randolph Skrovan, facilities manager for the lab, worked together on the proposals and, once funded, saw them through to fruition.</p>
<p>The lab, which is monitoring usage with the campus's <a href="../06/water-meters.xml">cellular water meter system</a>, has recorded a significant drop in freshwater use since both projects were completed in August.</p>
<p>For the first project, plumbers connected hose bibs to the water lines that draw Monterey Bay seawater that's used to fill dolphin, sea otter and sea lion pools. Researchers are frequently washing down the animal platforms, leading to a significant amount of water use. This project now allows them to use seawater instead of freshwater.</p>
<p>The second project was more complex. Six pumps at the marine lab had been using freshwater to flush their seals, a spinning part that keeps water from spraying out of its motor shaft, which would otherwise be shredded by sediment and salt water. Each seal used about a gallon of freshwater per minute all year long, which added up to about two million gallons each year.</p>
<p>With campus funding and the expertise of the Physical Plant department, Davenport and Skrovan were able to connect two pumps to filtered seawater that's circulated through the dolphin and seal pools. One pump was equipped with a more advanced seal that can withstand the gritty sea water.</p>
<p>Two other pumps that require a freshwater seal flush were outfitted with sensors that turn off the seal flush when the pumps are not running.</p>
<p>A year-over-year comparison of meter readings from the middle of the night - when people at the lab aren't using water for faucets and restrooms - shows that the facility's automated water usage has been reduced to 1.6 gallons per minute, roughly a 75 percent reduction from when it was using 6.6 gallons per minute.</p>

<p>It was, truly, a year to remember. We look forward to the next 50 great years of UC Santa Cruz. For now, here's a look back at a few of the highlights from this milestone year.</p>
<h2>Fiftieth festivities</h2>
<p>At its <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/fiat-fifty-feature-story-2015.html">Fiat Fifty spectacular celebration</a>, UC Santa Cruz threw a party like never before. Under a huge tent on the East Field, gravity-defying (and apparently boneless) dancer-gymnast-contortionists from Tandy Beal &amp; Company entertained a crowd of 750, and a beaming Alice Waters, the celebrated chef, author, and sustainable foods champion, gave a rousing keynote. Waters called UC Santa Cruz "an institution that has nurtured me and is really close to my heart, an institution that still expresses so many of the values I cherish and I fight for every day." Waters also gave <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/gemini-planet.html">a candid interview</a> with <em>UC Santa Cruz</em> <em>Review</em> magazine.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Waters <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/alice-waters.html">toured the 33-acre UC Santa Cruz Farm</a> and visited with apprentices in the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems Ecological Horticulture program before having lunch at the Alan Chadwick Garden, where an organic agriculture project first began on campus in 1967.</p>
<p>The party had a futuristic look, but the celebrants gestured toward the past with a special reunion <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/pioneer-class-reunion-feature-story.html">for pioneer students</a> and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJCCrT1Eb_c">evocative highlights film</a> during the big-tent party. The lavish gathering took place precisely 50 years to the day when the first UC Santa Cruz students started showing up to campus. And while the luxe celebration showed just how far UC Santa Cruz has come since the early days, it was fitting that the 21,600-square-foot tent went up just a short walk away from the East Field House, one of the oldest buildings on campus, and a social, academic, and athletic nexus for those early students.</p>
<p>&#8220;They ate dinner right over there," said Chancellor George Blumenthal, addressing the capacity crowd, pointing in the direction of the nearby East Field House. "And here we are, eating in a tent! But I'm sure they didn't eat as well as we're eating tonight."</p>
<p>The party continued with a gala first-annual <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/banana-slug-parade.html">Banana Slug Parade</a> in downtown Santa Cruz in October.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Alumni Weekend drew record-breaking crowds with lectures, panels, a farm-style lunch, and UC Santa Cruz's famous bay views. And students, staff, and faculty did their very best to bring back the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/1965-dress-up-day-feature-story.html">Spirit of &#8217;65</a> in a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/dress-like-1965-day.html">history-themed dress-up day</a>. But the campus, for all of the glories of its past, showed that it has lost none of its currency among young scholars, who vied, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/applications-release.html">in unprecedented numbers</a>, for a spot in its fall 2015 undergraduate class.</p>
<h2>Distinguished academics</h2>
<p>Fifty years is certainly a milestone. But that celebration in the tent was about more than just a number. UC Santa Cruz had many other causes to crow about aside from its age that night. Throughout their history, Slugs could take pride <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/rev-fall-15-big-ideas-0815.html">in a small campus where big things happen.</a> And this year was no exception. In the space of one year, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/11/presidential-chairs.html">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s number of endowed chairs jumped by almost a third</a>, with eight new funded chairs in everything from open software to screenwriting, bringing the grand total to 30 chairs. This is big news, especially considering those chairs drive faculty innovation, risk-taking, and creativity, while helping to retain renowned professors and researchers.</p>
<h2>Treading lightly</h2>
<p>Throughout the year, Slugs demonstrated their strong commitment to low-impact living. The Music Center was transformed into a "smart" building, reducing its annual carbon imprint <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/12/music-center-energy.html">by 98 tons</a>. The campus also upped its Earth-friendly credentials by <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/12/farm-internships.html">offering a new concentration in agroecology and sustainable food systems</a>, launching a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/11/conservation-scholars.html">conservation scholars program</a> aimed at increasing diversity, and reducing its dining waste so dramatically that the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/11/waste-reduction.html">Environmental Protection Agency took notice</a>. In the same year, UC Santa Cruz physics professor was named <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/climate-action-champion.html">Faculty Climate Action Champion</a> for 2015-16. The campus also took part in the University of California system-wide Cool Campus Challenge and earned kudos for <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/water-award.html">drought-related best practices</a> regarding water consumption and savings.</p>
<h2>Barnstorming</h2>
<p>The "big 5-0" was a great time to reflect on some old history on campus, including the picturesque but declining <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/barn-dedication.html">Cowell Ranch Hay Barn</a>, a relic of the campus's previous life as a ranch. These days, it&#8217;s looking much more spry, now that it has been rebuilt as headquarters for the Center For Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. A pie potluck and barn dance marked its completion.</p>
<h2>Newsmaking</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was the subject of high-profile headlines in major media outlets this year. The legendary food writer Mark Bittman <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/opinion/mark-bittman-the-roots-of-organic-farming.html?_r=0?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=top-story&amp;utm_campaign=september-2015&amp;mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=1139EE69F3CE23745C37376C9797BAF0&amp;gwt=pay&amp;assetType=opinion">traveled to UC Santa Cruz</a> to explore "the roots of organic farming" for the <em>New York Times</em>. The&#160;<em>Washington Post</em>&#160;highlighted UC Santa Cruz research about elephant seal behavior in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/13/the-mating-game-secrets-and-bloody-rivalries-of-the-giant-elephant-seal/">a colorful and dramatic story</a> called "The Mating Game Secrets and The Bloody Rivalries of the Giant Elephant Seal."&#160;And, not surprisingly, the 50-year anniversary celebration also received widespread attention, with big newspapers, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-uc-anniversaries-20150923-story.html">including the</a> <em><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-uc-anniversaries-20150923-story.html">Los Angeles Times</a>,</em> writing up this important year in campus history.&#160;</p>
<h2>Caring for others</h2>
<p>Slugs are known for caring about others who are struggling with injustice and poverty in all corners of the planet. UC Santa Cruz alumni are truly citizens of the world, so it made sense that one of the most moving and informative stories about women surviving ISIS terrorism&#8212;and escaping to tell their story&#8212;was written by an alumna, Azadeh Moaveni (Oakes '98, politics,), whose dramatic and detailed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/world/middleeast/isis-wives-and-enforcers-in-syria-recount-collaboration-anguish-and-escape.html?_r=0">Sunday <em>New York Times</em> article</a> about &#8220;collaboration, anguish, and escape&#8221; was one of the most talked-about stories of the year, garnering more than 1,580 reader comments. Other Slugs got to work <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/one-people-one-reef.html">trying to save islands</a>, developing <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/adams-dustin.html">an app to help blind photographers</a>, and doing their part to <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/social-mobility.html">encourage social mobility</a> of students.</p>
<h2>Changing the world with research and scientific exploration</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s great minds put their ideas to work, whether they were expanding the world&#8217;s know-how about a troubling <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/11/bat-disease-china.html">bat disease</a>, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/ocean-circulation.html">ocean circulation</a>, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/aids-vaccine.html">the AIDs vaccine</a>, the heart rates of <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/healthy-hearts.html">big-wave surfers</a>, the mysteries of <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/appetite-control.html">appetite control</a>, an especially nasty widespread <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/07/hab-update.html">algal bloom</a>, and the detection of the devastating <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/ebola-detection.html">Ebola virus</a>. Scientists on campus shined a light&#8212;so to speak&#8212;on the various ways a black hole can <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/tidal-disruption.html">gulp down stars for breakfast</a>. It was also a year of mighty partnerships. UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Genomics Institute <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/genomics-microsoft-partnership.html">joined forces with Microsoft</a> to accelerate biomedical research. Astronomers even discovered <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/gemini-planet.html">a young and rather Jupiter-ish planet</a>.</p>
<h2>The spirit of collaboration</h2>
<p>Restricting your thought processes and ideas to just one discipline is <em>so</em> yesterday at UC Santa Cruz, which prides itself on unexpected convergences. The Division of Social Sciences&#8217; third annual <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/11/research-frontiers.html">Research Frontiers event</a> in early November was a great opportunity to explore the way various interests and areas of expertise can overlap in fascinating and useful ways, whether we&#8217;re talking about an economist using biology to analyze New York City crime or a psychologist peering into the realm of street art.</p>
<h2>In the public eye</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz events and activities were anything but low profile in 2015. It was a time to court passionate public discussion. A case in point: Activist, author, and UC Santa Cruz professor emerita <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/angela-davis-speaks-at-mlk-convocation.html">Angela Davis</a> drew one of the largest crowds in the three-decade-long history of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation, packing the 1,800-capacity Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium while a crowd of hundreds stood outside the doors and down the block hoping to get in. The last time a convocation drew a comparable response was in 2002 when Alice Walker, author of the bestselling 1982 novel <em>The Color Purple</em>, delivered the keynote.</p>
<h2>Creative minds</h2>
<p>And speaking of art, this year, alumna Gillian Welch received a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/gillian-welch-songwriting.html">Lifetime Achievement Award</a> in songwriting, noted UC Santa Cruz alumni authors reflected on the way the campus <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/rev-fall-15-life-realized-0815.html">changed their lives</a> and gave them "a ha" moments to sustain them well into the future. The successful filmmaker and alumnus <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/princess-grace-film.html">Cary Fukunaga,</a> along with a distinguished undergraduate, won the Princess Grace Award for emerging artists. The campus also marked its age and its cultural achievement with a special exhibition highlighting <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/50th-alumni-art.html">50 artists from five decades.</a></p>
<h2>A sense of generosity</h2>
<p>Slugs gave back this year in ways that have as much to do with heartstrings as purse strings. Alumnus Sage Weil provided $3 million for <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/sage-weil-gifts.html">open research</a> at UC Santa Cruz. &#160;Generosity was a way for Slugs to <a href="http://profiles.giving.ucsc.edu/2015/10/19/may-her-memory-be-a-blessing/">remember loved ones</a> and <a href="http://giving.ucsc.edu/profiles/donors/long-darrell.html">sustain their names</a> far into the future, <a href="http://giving.ucsc.edu/profiles/donors/shou-symantec.html">start virtuous cycles</a>, <a href="http://profiles.giving.ucsc.edu/2015/11/05/rising-to-the-challenge/">assist ambitious students pursuing their dreams</a> in spite of obstacles, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/rev-fall-14-philanthropy-focus.html">restore a beloved campus landmark</a> to its former glory, and <a href="http://giving.ucsc.edu/reports/2013-14/articles/why-i-give-summer15.php">give back to the campus</a> for changing their destinies.</p>
<p>All this giving was part of the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu">ongoing $300 million Campaign</a> for UC Santa Cruz.</p>

<br/>
 The new rules include a minimum mandatory suspension for two years for violations of the sexual violence policy and a minimum mandatory suspension of one year for other forms of sexual misconduct.<br/>
<br/>
 These rules are being implemented at all 10 UC campuses with the same standards, requirements, and time frames.<br/>
<br/>
 The University of California is committed to creating and maintaining a community free of sexual violence and sexual harassment for every individual. Sexual violence and sexual harassment violate both the law and university policy.<br/>
<br/>
 UC President Napolitano has called for UC to be the national leader in prevention and response to sexual violence and sexual assault and formed a task force to develop new procedures and rules and create a national model. The task force process resulted in eight key overarching mandates that form the <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/ethics-compliance-audit-services/compliance/SVSA.html" target="_blank">UC National Model</a> for prevention, education, advocacy, and response.<br/>
<br/>
 The university has formal procedures that provide for the investigation of reports of sexual violence and sexual harassment by the Title IX office, a review of the investigative findings and sanctioning recommendations by the Student Conduct office, and the imposition of discipline by the Student Conduct office as appropriate. Both the complainant and the respondent may appeal the decision or sanctions. The new sanctions (two-year suspensions) will be imposed on students found responsible for policy violations in Title IX investigations initiated January 1, 2016 or later.<br/>
<br/>
 In addition, students may file reports with the UCSC Police Department for possible criminal investigation and prosecution and, regardless of how students choose to report, the <a href="http://care.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">CARE Advocate office</a> is available to provide confidential support to those who have experienced any form of sexual violence.<br/>

<p>The $1.76 million research grant will support work at five UC campuses, led by UCLA, to develop a revolutionary bioinformatics toolkit to understand changes in gene expression and how threatened populations respond to changes in their habitats and the climate. The collaboration will involve undergraduate students and the public in a DNA-based biodiversity survey across California.</p>
<p>"Our aim is to develop conservation genomics tools for both academic and non-profit use, with a focus on species of special concern to California," said Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and co-director of the project.</p>
<p>Shapiro and project leader Robert Wayne of UCLA developed the proposal for the project, which has three broad aims for advancing the role of genomics in effective conservation: to develop new approaches, to perform cutting-edge research in conservation, and to give the broader community access to these tools and research results.</p>
<p>The researchers have identified 13 species of special conservation significance to California, which they will use as "test cases" for conservation genomics research. At UC Santa Cruz, researchers will focus on four of those species: mountain lions, sea otters, black abalone, and sea stars.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Four awards</strong></p>
<p>The recipients of the UC Catalyst prize were chosen from a pool of more than 180 proposed projects. The four awards Napolitano announced total more than $4.8 million. The other research projects focus on enhancing agricultural resilience in times of drought, preserving cultural heritage sites in the Middle East, and detecting dark matter.</p>
<p>"Some of the most important research happening today is interdisciplinary and collaborative," Napolitano said. "With these awards we are creating new opportunities for those kinds of productive partnerships while furthering research that ranges from archaeology to particle physics."</p>
<p>Napolitano launched the President's Research Catalyst Awards in December 2014. The program channels $10 million over three years to fund research in areas of strategic importance, such as sustainability and climate, equity and social justice, health care, and basic discovery.</p>
<p>To qualify, projects must be multi-campus, multi-disciplinary efforts that offer research, teaching and learning opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. This year, applicants were also asked to incorporate public engagement and faculty mentorship components into the projects.</p>
<p>This year's recipients were selected following a highly competitive review process. A panel of experts evaluated applications and recommended 10 finalists to the president. Napolitano then selected four projects that represent a broad scope of disciplinary and topical diversity and will be of benefit to California and the world.</p>
<p>The awards are funded through an existing president's fund used to support systemwide initiatives.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/12/climate-institute.html</url><title>UC Santa Cruz leads UC effort to study effects of climate change on ecosystems</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8cca43588072701704be48b5799a1a88"><name>hot-jupiters</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Exoplanet atmospheres range from clear to cloudy in survey of 'hot Jupiters'</title><summary>A survey of Jupiter-sized exoplanets reveals why some of these worlds appear to have less water than expected.</summary><keywords>Jonathan Fortney, exoplanet atmospheres, extrasolar planets, hot Jupiters</keywords><start-date>1450108800000</start-date><display-name>Exoplanet atmospheres range from clear to cloudy in survey of 'hot Jupiters'</display-name><path>/2015/12/hot-jupiters</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/12/hot-jupiters</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1449766044473</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1450108692694</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/planets-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/planets-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>planets-500.jpg</name><display-name>planets-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>86351</file-size><width>500</width><height>305</height></image><image-alt>images of planets in two rows</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/planets-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/planets-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>planets-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>planets-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22824</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>image of a planet</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>In this artist's impression of the ten "hot Jupiter" exoplanets, the images are to scale with each other.

<p>The results of the survey showed that the atmospheres of those "hot Jupiter" planets with faint water signals also contained clouds and haze that can hide evidence of water. Hot Jupiters that appear cloud free, however, show strong signs of water. The findings were published December 14 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>"Our results suggest it's simply clouds hiding the water from prying eyes, and therefore rule out dry hot Jupiters," explained coauthor Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. "The alternative theory to this is that planets form in an environment deprived of water, but this would require us to completely rethink our current theories of how planets are born."</p>
<p><strong>New insights</strong></p>
<p>The study offers new insights into the wide range of planetary atmospheres in our galaxy and how planets are assembled.</p>
<p>"I'm really excited to finally see this wide group of planets together, as this is the first time we&#8217;ve had sufficient wavelength coverage to compare multiple features from one planet to another," said lead author David Sing of the University of Exeter, UK. "We found the planetary atmospheres to be much more diverse than we expected."</p>
<p>Of the few thousand planets discovered orbiting other stars, a subset are known as hot Jupiters, gaseous planets with characteristics similar to those of Jupiter but that orbit very close to their stars, making them blistering hot.</p>
<p>Hubble has only explored a handful of hot Jupiters because they are lost in the glare of their host stars. The wavelength range has been limited to studies in optical light. These initial studies found several planets to hold less water than expected, raising a puzzle as to why they look "dry."</p>
<p><strong>Catalog of exoplanets</strong></p>
<p>The international team of astronomers has tackled the problem by making the largest-ever spectroscopic catalog of exoplanet atmospheres. The team used multiple observations from Hubble to study the planets across an unprecedented range of wavelengths.</p>
<p>All of the planets follow orbits that have them pass in front of their parent star, as seen from Earth. During this so-called transit, some of the starlight travels through the planet's outer atmosphere. "The atmosphere leaves its unique fingerprint on the starlight, which we can study when the light reaches us," explained coauthor Hannah Wakeford of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. These fingerprints allowed the team to extract the signatures from various elements and molecules &#8212; including water &#8212; and distinguish between cloudy and cloud-free exoplanets.</p>
<p>According to Fortney, the scorching temperatures on these hot Jupiters mean that their clouds are very different from those on Earth. Instead of water vapor, clouds on the hottest planets are likely to consist of liquid iron droplets. "These are exotic clouds on exotic planets," he said.</p>
<p>The study of exoplanetary atmospheres is currently in its infancy, with only a handful of observations taken so far. Hubble&#8217;s successor, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will open a new infrared window on the study of exoplanets and their atmospheres.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8cf040f68072701704be48b56bf38e2c"><name>sealions-domoic-acid</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sea lions exposed to algal toxin show impaired spatial memory</title><summary>Brain damage caused by the neurotoxin domoic acid may affect sea lions' ability to survive in the wild.</summary><keywords>Colleen Reichmuth, Pinniped Lab, sea lions and domoic acid, domoic acid, California sea lions</keywords><start-date>1450121400000</start-date><display-name>Sea lions exposed to algal toxin show impaired spatial memory</display-name><path>/2015/12/sealions-domoic-acid</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/12/sealions-domoic-acid</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1449768534224</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1454019648004</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/scoggins-beach-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/scoggins-beach-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>scoggins-beach-400.jpg</name><display-name>scoggins-beach-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>87638</file-size><width>400</width><height>275</height></image><image-alt>sea lion on beach</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/nikkimadie-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/nikkimadie-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nikkimadie-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>nikkimadie-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23264</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>California sea lion</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Hundreds of sea lions strand on California beaches every year with symptoms of domoic acid poisoning.

The new findings suggest that chronic exposure to the toxin, produced by naturally occurring marine algae, causes impairments that are likely to affect sea lions' ability to navigate in their ocean habitat and survive in the wild.</p>
<p>Domoic acid, a potent neurotoxin, captured headlines this year after it was detected in Dungeness crabs, prompting authorities to delay the opening of the crab season on the west coast. For California sea lions, however, the toxin has been causing problems for years. Hundreds of sea lions strand on California beaches every year with symptoms of domoic acid poisoning, including disorientation and seizures. Prior research has characterized the clinical effects of the toxin, but the behavioral effects of domoic acid poisoning in wild animals had not been assessed.</p>
<p>A team led by scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, studied 30 California sea lions undergoing veterinary care and rehabilitation at the <a href="http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/">Marine Mammal Center</a> in Sausalito. Researchers administered behavioral tests to assess spatial memory and performed brain imaging (MRI) to see the extent of brain lesions in the affected animals.</p>
<p>Damage to the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory, is often seen in sea lions with domoic acid poisoning, according to first author Peter Cook, who led the study as a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz and is now at Emory University. "In this study, we were able to correlate the extent of hippocampal damage to specific behavioral impairments relevant to the animals' survival in the wild," Cook said.</p>
<p><strong>Impaired performance</strong></p>
<p>The study documented impaired performance on short- and long-term spatial memory tasks in animals with hippocampal lesions. These deficits are likely to interfere with a sea lion's ability to find food and may also help explain anecdotal reports of sea lions showing up in unusual places far outside their normal range, either too far out at sea or inland far from the coast, according to coauthor Colleen Reichmuth, director of the <a href="http://pinnipedlab.ucsc.edu/">Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Laboratory</a> at UC Santa Cruz where the behavioral tests were conducted.</p>
<p>Domoic acid is produced by microscopic algae (diatoms in the genus <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em>) that occur naturally in coastal waters. Blooms of the toxic algae along the California coast typically occur in the spring and fall and last just a few weeks, but they have been increasing in frequency and severity. This year's massive bloom, the largest ever recorded, lasted through the summer and extended from Santa Barbara to Alaska.</p>
<p>During a <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> bloom, domoic acid accumulates in shellfish and small fish such as anchovies and sardines that feed on algae filtered from the water. Animals that feed on those fish, including sea lions and other marine mammals and seabirds, can be exposed to high levels of the toxin.</p>
<p>The sea lion study was carried out over several years, and the researchers tested animals with and without symptoms of brain damage caused by exposure to domoic acid. Cook noted that during an algal bloom, sea lions brought to the Marine Mammal Center with acute domoic acid poisoning may not yet have permanent brain damage. Acute poisoning can cause seizures and disorientation, but brain lesions develop over time, likely as a result of a chronic epileptic condition caused by one or more exposures to the toxin, he said. Sea lions with symptoms of brain damage strand on beaches all year round, even when there is no active bloom of the toxic algae.</p>
<p>"What isn't well understood yet is the dose response," Cook said. "We don't know how heavy the exposure needs to be, or how often repeated, to cause this kind of brain damage, and we don't know the effects of repeated low-dose exposure."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Brain networks</strong></p>
<p>In addition to assessing the behavioral effects of brain damage, the research team also used functional MRI to look at the effects of domoic acid exposure on important brain networks. They found that sea lions with symptoms of toxic exposure had greatly reduced connectivity between the hippocampus and the thalamus, a pathway known to be essential for the formation of episodic memory (memories of events or experiences) in rodents and humans.</p>
<p>"This is the first evidence of changes to brain networks in exposed sea lions, and suggests that these animals may be suffering a broad disruption of memory, not just spatial memory deficits," Cook said. "It's rare to have this type of experimental evidence linking a naturally occurring neurotoxic effect to behavioral impairment in a wild animal. There are thousands of California sea lions with varying degrees of exposure to domoic acid out there. Sea lions navigate a complex and changing environment, and if their spatial memory is impaired it's bound to affect their ability to survive in the wild."</p>

The toxin was also detected for the first time in the muscle tissue or filet of several commercial fish species.</p>
<p>Investigations led by scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, help explain the extraordinary duration and intensity of the 2015 domoic acid event, the spread of the toxin through the marine food web, and its persistence in Dungeness crab months after the algal bloom disappeared from coastal waters. Ocean scientist Raphael Kudela, the Lynn Professor of Ocean Health at UC Santa Cruz, will present the latest research findings at the <a href="http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2015/">American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting</a> in San Francisco on Friday, December 18.</p>
<p>Domoic acid is a potent neurotoxin produced by a type of microscopic algae called <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> that occurs naturally in coastal waters. Blooms of the toxic algae along the California coast typically occur in the spring and fall and last just a few weeks. This year, however, unusual oceanographic conditions (unrelated to El Ni&#241;o) led to the largest and longest-lasting bloom ever recorded.</p>
<p>"The duration of the bloom and the intensity of the toxicity were unprecedented, and that led to record levels of the toxin in species such as anchovies, razor clams, and crabs," Kudela said. "We also saw the toxin in organisms and parts of organisms where we thought it was not supposed to be, like the filets of fish."</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring programs</strong></p>
<p>Monitoring programs are in place to ensure the safety of seafood for human consumption, leading to the closure of several west coast fisheries and the delayed opening of the Dungeness crab season. In humans, domoic acid poisoning is also known as amnesic shellfish poisoning because it may cause permanent loss of short-term memory, as well as neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms. In 1987, four people died of domoic acid poisoning in Canada after eating contaminated mussels, but such cases are rare.</p>
<p>The levels of toxin detected this year in the filets of salmon, rockfish, and ling cod were well below the regulatory limits, Kudela said. But once the toxin gets into the muscle tissue, it will stay in the fish and in the food web much longer than if it is just in the intestinal track.</p>
<p>"Before this year, it was a big question whether it gets into the filet at all," he said. "We think what happened is the bloom lasted so long and was so toxic that the prolonged exposure allowed the toxin to perfuse into the muscle tissue, and it also worked its way into the food web to an extent that we hadn't seen before."</p>
<p><strong>Prolonged bloom</strong></p>
<p>The prolonged bloom probably also allowed a lot of toxin to build up in sediments on the seafloor, which would explain why Dungeness crabs are still showing high levels of toxin. Previous studies by Kudela's team showed that sediments on the seafloor can hold a reservoir of toxin that lasts for months after the algal bloom goes away. "The crabs are feeding on the seafloor, and all the things they would typically eat can hold the toxin for months," he said. "It could be another month or longer before the toxin in crabs drops below the regulatory limit everywhere in California."</p>
<p>The good news, Kudela said, is that scientists now have a much better understanding of the factors that lead to <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> blooms. His lab has developed a forecasting model that has performed well at predicting where and when domoic acid will be a problem.</p>
<p>A combination of warm water and nutrients creates ideal conditions for a toxic bloom of <em>Pseudo-nitzschia,</em> Kudela said. That's a relatively uncommon combination along the west coast, where wind-driven upwelling of cold deep water is a major source of nutrients in coastal ecosystems. When there's no upwelling of cold water, the layer of warm water on the surface tends to be low in nutrients. <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> blooms typically occur during the transitional periods in the spring and fall, when upwelling is getting started or winding down and nutrients mix with warm water for a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Warm blob</strong></p>
<p>In 2015, however, the usual patterns were disrupted by a warm-water anomaly known as the "warm blob," which first appeared in the North Pacific west of Seattle in late 2013. In 2014, a second warm blob developed off of southern California, and in 2015 they spread into the coastal waters. "We had two pools of warm water hitting the coast in the Pacific Northwest and southern California and merging, so all at once there were warm waters over the whole west coast," Kudela said.</p>
<p>That warm water then interacted with coastal upwelling to create perfect conditions for <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em>. Normally, the northerly winds that start in the spring blow the warm surface waters offshore, driving the upwelling of cold deep water and creating a regime of cold, nutrient-rich coastal waters that lasts until fall. In 2015, weak upwelling provided periodic injections of nutrients, but every time the upwelling got started the warm blob pushed back onto the coast.</p>
<p>The result was a record-breaking toxic algae bloom that started in April and lasted into early October. The size of the bloom was also unprecedented, extending from Santa Barbara to Alaska. Even in December, water samples were still occasionally showing up with domoic acid, Kudela said. "We think it's just moving offshore, and each time conditions are right it comes back in to the coast," he said. "Once a series of big winter storms comes through, that's when we'll see it go away until the following spring."</p>
<p>Now the big question is what the impact of El Ni&#241;o will be in 2016, because El Ni&#241;o also brings warm water conditions that can favor toxic algae blooms. Most of the warm water along the California coast in 2015 was from the warm blob, although El Ni&#241;o probably began contributing to it later in the summer. Historically, El Ni&#241;o periods have been associated with larger than normal blooms of <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em>, Kudela said.</p>
<p>"The predictions are for this El Ni&#241;o to be as strong as the one in 1997-98, when the warm water lasted through 1998. So we could be looking at a big bloom again next year," he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/algal-bloom.html</url><title>Large

Division have been awarded Rydell Visual Arts Fellowships.</p>
<p>The new 2016-17 fellows include Irene Lusztig, associate professor of film and digital media, and the collaborative team of Helen and Newton Harrison, professors-in-residence in the Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) graduate program.</p>
<p>The Rydell fellowships were established by long-time Santa Cruz cultural icons Roy and Frances Rydell and are administered by the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>They are awarded solely on artistic merit by a panel of arts professionals from outside the Santa Cruz area.</p>
<p>Four winners this year were selected from a pool of 61 artists.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/01/harrisons-sesnon.html"><strong><em>Helen and Newton Harrison</em></strong></a>&#160;have spent the last four decades working with biologists, ecologists, architects, urban planners and other artists to explore ideas that use the arts as a vehicle for environmental change</p>
<p>Pioneers of the environmental and ecological art movement, the Harrisons are known for their use of maps as narratives to track climate change and ecosystems.</p>
<p>The Harrisons have presented their work in two Venice Biennales, two Sao Paolo Biennales, the Museums of Modern Art in Chicago, San Francisco, Bonn (Germany), Ljublijana (Slovenia) and the Museum of the Revolution in Zagreb (Croatia).&#160;</p>
<p><a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/05/watsonville-film.html"><em><strong>Irene Lusztig</strong></em></a> is a filmmaker, media archeologist, and visual artist. Her film and video work mines old images and technologies for new meanings in order to reframe and revive forgotten and neglected histories.</p>
<p>Born in England to Romanian parents, Lusztig grew up in Boston and has lived in France, Italy, Romania, China, and Russia. She received her BA in filmmaking and Chinese studies from Harvard and completed her MFA in film and video at Bard College.</p>
<p>Her work has been screened around the world in such venues as the Museum of Modern Art, Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Anthology Film Archives, Pacific Film Archive, IDFA Amsterdam, and on television in the US, Europe, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>A current exhibition at the <a href="http://rblitzergallery.com"><em><strong>r. blitzer gallery</strong></em></a> in Santa Cruz is now featuring the artwork of the 2014-15 Rydell fellows. Running through January, it includes the work of UC Santa Cruz art professor Elizabeth Stephens.</p>
<p>Stephens&#8217;s art has explored sexuality,&#160;gender,&#160;and feminism for nearly three decades. Her recent film,&#160;<em>Goodbye Gauley Mountain, An Ecosexual Love Story</em>, created in collaboration with Annie Sprinkle, opened the 2013&#160;Santa Cruz Film Festival.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/01/harrisons-sesnon.html</url><title>Exhibition by internationally known environmental artists at Sesnon Gallery</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/05/watsonville-film.html</url><title>Documentary by 20 UCSC students to premiere at SC Film Festival</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="936c4cde8072701704be48b5bcd2edc7"><name>opers-looks-back-feature-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>50 years of OPERS at UC Santa Cruz: pride, memories, and vintage snapshots</title><summary>This fall, a group of long-time OPERS staff members shared recollections and vintage photos celebrating the office's history. </summary><start-date>1450123200000</start-date><display-name>OPERS Looks Back</display-name><path>/2015/12/opers-looks-back-feature-story</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/12/opers-looks-back-feature-story</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1449877327013</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1450290179934</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/Opers big group shot 500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/Opers big group shot 500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Opers big group shot 500.jpg</name><display-name>Opers big group shot 500.jpg</display-name><file-size>79047</file-size><width>500</width><height>403</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/opers-thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/opers-thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>opers-thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>opers-thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>18544</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p><br/>
 UCSC hosted the All Cal Intramurals Festival in 1982. They changed the traditional format of the games to be co-ed and also made the teams inter-campus. This means, for instance, in a tennis match, a man from UC Santa Cruz might be paired up with a woman from UC San Diego to compete against a man from UC Barbara and a woman from&#160;UC Davis. This photo shows a variety of inter-campus players.

They don't hand out sports scholarships to come here. The school mascot is a mollusk that can't even run&#8212;or, for that matter, walk.</p>
<p>But sports and recreation have always been an important part of the campus's identity. Athletic teams are packed with committed and talented students and coaches. Part of UC Santa Cruz's spirit manifests itself on the playing field, the practice room, and the dance studio.</p>
<p>Ever since the campus opened its doors 50 years ago, the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports (OPERS) at UC Santa Cruz has given students, faculty, staff, alumni, and the Santa Cruz community the opportunity to become actively involved in an organized sports and recreation program. OPERS oversees intramural sports clubs, drop-in recreation, and physical education classes that serve the entire campus community.</p>
<p><strong>Treasure trove of OPERS photos</strong></p>
<p>This fall, a group of long-time OPERS staff members shared recollections and vintage photos celebrating the office's history. The quirky photos&#8212;some with readily identifiable students and staff members from the '60s, '70s, and '80s, others with cryptic scenes and tantalizingly mysterious explanatory notes scrawled on the back&#8212;reveal the past of a campus where students cherish freedom of expression as much as they value the sporting life.</p>
<p>One photo shows the smiling 1984 winter co-ed basketball champions. This snapshot must have been taken just after this group of erstwhile Slugs tromped the opposing team, whoever that was.</p>
<p>There are several pictures of Summer Recreation Program students from off campus bravely zooming around in what appears to be a homemade go-cart, and getting ready for some serious "spelunking" through a cave on campus.</p>
<p>In a couple of black-and-white photos, a groundskeeper from long ago patrols the area near the East Field House. His name is Mel Hussey, and he looks like he's having a very fine time.</p>
<p>In another picture, a UC Santa Cruz student takes what seems to be a risky leap into a body of water that appears, from the photo, to be only a few inches deep. All the photos have inscrutable little thumbtack holes on the top as if they've been hanging on someone's bulletin board for who knows how long.</p>
<p>The photos show a wildly disparate variety of OPERS scenes. Julie Kimball, a yoga and swim instructor for OPERS, likened all these sports and recreation possibilities to "so many spokes to the wheel. The wheel can be a metaphor for an institution with many moving parts. Since 1965, OPERS has been an integral wheel and/or a hub on campus. It offers something for everyone&#8212;4,000 individuals come through our doors daily."</p>
<p>Whether those affiliates are learning wilderness survival skills, taking a swimming course, learning to surf, playing tennis, participating in intramural softball or ultimate Frisbee, or just making use of the Olympic-style pool, they're enriching their lives outside the classroom or escaping momentarily from the pressures of work.</p>
<p><strong>Sports for personal enrichment</strong></p>
<p>The lack of a football team is part of what makes UC Santa Cruz unconventional. But, as these old photos attest, all along the campus has embraced sports and recreation for personal enrichment.</p>
<p>"I think there was a push at some point to try and make sports a little more 'legitimate,' a little bit more institutionalized like Berkeley and places like that," said Karol Fabrizio, retired director of recreation at UC Santa Cruz. "But the campus never really went for it. Traditionally all these things are great, and it's nice that (other schools) offer them, but I don't think our students wanted to back referendums to put huge amounts of money in stadiums and have to fund an operational budget (for major sports teams)."</p>
<p>The idea, she said, is to make sports and recreation activities as inclusive and enriching as possible, including the popular Wilderness Orientation programs for incoming first-years, who have been camping out and bonding together in national forests and parks each summer for over 25 years.</p>
<p>"It is very clear why I love it," said Rena Cochlin, a dance instructor at OPERS for the past 42 years, referring to the accessible programs. The idea, she said, is "to get students with two left feet, and we offer them classes that will help them get one right foot and one left one, and introduce them to things they can do for the rest of their lives."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="937537f28072701704be48b5e0e505a5"><name>tan-acm-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Computer scientist Wang-Chiew Tan named ACM Fellow</title><summary>Tan, a professor of computer science, was named a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.</summary><keywords>Wang-Chiew Tan, ACM Fellow</keywords><start-date>1449820800000</start-date><display-name>Computer scientist Wang-Chiew Tan named ACM Fellow</display-name><path>/2015/12/tan-acm-fellow</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/12/tan-acm-fellow</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1449877911510</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1449878079144</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/wang-chiew-tan.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/wang-chiew-tan.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wang-chiew-tan.jpg</name><display-name>wang-chiew-tan.jpg</display-name><file-size>43657</file-size><width>250</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Wang-Chiew Tan</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/wang-chiew-tan-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/wang-chiew-tan-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wang-chiew-tan-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>wang-chiew-tan-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14446</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Wang-Chiew Tan</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Wang-Chiew Tan</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Wang-Chiew Tan, professor of computer science in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has been named a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the world's leading computing society.</p>

When one of the jets happens to be aimed in the direction of Earth, as illustrated here, the galaxy appears especially bright and is classified as a blazar. (Image credit: M.

<p>The galaxy, known as PKS 1441+25, is a rare type of galaxy called a blazar, a tremendously bright beacon powered by a supermassive black hole at the heart of the galaxy. Blazars are intrinsically unsteady light sources and can sometimes emit flares ten to a hundred times brighter than their baseline emissions. A flare from PKS 1441+25 was detected in April 2015 and observed by a range of telescopes sensitive to different wavelengths, including the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) in Arizona.</p>
<p>"With VERITAS, we detected gamma rays from this unusual object at the highest energies observed on Earth," said Jonathan Biteau, who led the analysis of the data as a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Escape from annihilation</strong></p>
<p>Such very high-energy gamma rays were unexpected, he said, because they faced a good chance of being annihilated at some point during the 7.6 billion years they spent traveling toward Earth. When high-energy gamma rays collide with lower-energy photons, they annihilate and create an electron-positron pair. To reach telescopes on Earth, the gamma rays from PKS 1441+25 had to avoid a tight net of photons surrounding the vicinity of the black hole, as well as a looser net of photons, the extragalactic background light (EBL), that fills the universe.</p>
<p>The EBL is a faint glow that pervades the space between galaxies, consisting of photons from all the stars and galaxies that have existed. It is hard to measure because there are so many bright sources of light nearby. Astronomers have used cosmological models to estimate the EBL, galaxy counts to set lower limits, and gamma rays from blazars (as well as direct observations of dark patches of sky) to set upper limits. The farther gamma rays have to travel the more likely they are to encounter photons of the EBL and annihilate, so the detection of a source 7.6 billion light-years away was surprising.</p>
<p>"With PKS 1441+25, we can now place tight constraints on this loose net of photons," said Biteau. "This is clearly the opening of a new era where we can compare source-by-source measurements and start to probe the cosmic evolution of the extragalactic background light."</p>
<p>Biteau, now an associate professor at Institut de Physique Nucl&#233;aire d'Orsay in France, and UC Santa Cruz graduate student Caitlin Johnson are corresponding authors of a paper on the findings to be published in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> and currently <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/815/2/L22">available online</a>. Johnson analyzed data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope which complemented the data from VERITAS.</p>
<p>"Combining the Fermi data with the VERITAS data enabled us to make the constraints on the EBL much tighter," she said. "The window is slowly narrowing."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Emission region</strong></p>
<p>But what about the tight net of photons around the tremendously bright blazar? That helps locate the region where the gamma rays were emitted, said coauthor David Williams, adjunct professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz. "If the gamma rays were produced close to the black hole, the radiation fields there are strong enough to absorb them. So the fact that the gamma rays are getting out of the galaxy at all indicates they were produced farther away from the black hole," Williams said.</p>
<p>The black hole is surrounded by a glowing disk of hot gas and dust swirling in toward the center. Some of this infalling matter, instead of being swallowed by the black hole, gets channeled into two powerful jets emitted from the poles of the spinning black hole, perpendicular to the accretion disk. One of these jets is pointing in our direction, "like a flashlight shining in our eyes," Johnson said.</p>
<p>Physicists are still debating the exact mechanism behind gamma-ray emissions from the jets, but PKS 1441+25 provides important clues, Biteau said. "With observations across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, we have now realized that the location of the gamma-ray emissions for this source has to be at least a tenth of a light year away from the black hole. Otherwise, none of the gamma rays would escape," he said.</p>
<p>The researchers estimated that the emission region is probably at a distance of about five light years from the black hole, much further than expected. According to a leading scenario for the gamma-ray emissions, high energy electrons are accelerated to near the speed of light in the jet, interact with photons, and transfer their energy, boosting the photons to gamma-ray energies.</p>
<p>"These observations constitute a fantastic step forward in our understanding of blazars as cosmic accelerators and as light beacons for gamma ray cosmology," Biteau said.</p>
<p>In addition to Biteau, Johnson, and Williams, the coauthors of the study include an international team of researchers from 30 institutions in the United States, Canada, Ireland, France, and Germany. This research is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution, NASA, and by NSERC in Canada.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a31b29368072701704be48b574b7dbb2"><name>food-security</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cultivating a garden — and food security — in Watsonville</title><summary>College Nine and Ten Provost Flora Lu and her students are forging campus-community collaborations through a community garden at Calabasas Elementary School in Watsonville.</summary><keywords>colleges nine and ten, food security, watsonville, </keywords><start-date>1450137600000</start-date><display-name>Food security</display-name><path>/2015/12/food-security</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2015/12/food-security</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1450140444914</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1451953422587</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Cheri O'Neil</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/food-security-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/food-security-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>food-security-500px.jpg</name><display-name>food-security-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>177727</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Intern serving vegetables</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2015/12/images/food-security-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2015/12/images/food-security-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>food-security-80px.jpg</name><display-name>food-security-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>18840</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Fresh vegetables</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p><span>Sarah Woodruff is a UC Santa Cruz student and the intern coordinator for the effort.

Rain the day before had turned the dirt to sticky mud on the bottoms of her shoes, but what she cared about was the wide-open field - and its seeds for the future.</p>
<p>Lu, <a href="../../2014/05/lu-provost.xml">provost</a> for Colleges Nine and Ten and professor in Environmental Studies, may be best known for her longitudinal research with Native Amazonians of Northeastern Ecuador. But the professor's feet are also firmly planted in the Pajaro Valley, where so many of the people who work in this bountiful agricultural area can't afford to buy the food they harvest and don't have access to land to grow it for themselves.</p>
<p>Three years ago, she established a community partnership with this school in south Santa Cruz County, where a few years prior some UCSC interns had started a Children's Discovery Garden that fell into into neglect when the students graduated. Lu's students in her service-learning course on environmental justice renovated a greenhouse that had been vandalized, repaired compost bins, installed an irrigation system, built raised vegetable beds, and revitalized the afterschool garden program for the children of Calabasas School, many from farmworker families.</p>
<p>Lu has even bigger dreams going into 2016 with funding support from the UC Santa Cruz Blum Center on Poverty, Social Enterprise &amp; Participatory Governance, as well as Measure 43, the Student Fee Advisory Committee, and local donations of time, money, and materials from such companies as Whiskey Hill Farm, Granite Construction, and Eco-Shift Consulting.</p>
<p>"This program will forge campus-community collaborations between UCSC students and a low-income, people-of-color community in Watsonville," she said, "with the goals of cultivating food security and sovereignty, and strengthening parent-school connections."</p>
<p>The program's objectives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding the afterschool program and integrating the cultivation of food into the educational curriculum of both the elementary school and UCSC.</li>
<li>Creating a vibrant community garden with the help of parents and community members that will serve as a catalyst for greater neighborhood cohesion and parent involvement.</li>
<li>Fostering culturally important plants, improving food security, and building eco-friendly infrastructure at the community garden, including a solar-powered outdoor kitchen and a rainwater harvest system.</li>
<li>Establishing a sister garden at Colleges Nine and Ten to exchange agroecological knowledge between UCSC and Watsonville, and organizing a campus event for Watsonville residents to share their experiences as immigrants, farmworkers, and advocates for food justice.</li>
<li>Providing experiential learning opportunities for UCSC students, and expanding and enhancing curriculum about food justice.</li>
</ul>
<p>The experience of collaborating with UCSC has already been life-changing for students, said Todd Westfall, principal at Calabasas, who grew up in the Watsonville neighborhood in the '70s. The school serves more than 600 elementary students, which includes almost 100 children from the Buena Vista Migrant Camp for part of every school year.</p>
<p>"We took two busloads of parents and students to Colleges Nine and Ten at the UCSC campus on 'Hallows' Eve,' and they welcomed us with dinner, presentations, games, and activities," Westfall said. "They even took the students trick-or-treating through the dorms. It was beyond our expectations. Most of these parents had never graduated from high school, and now their children are talking about college."</p>
<p>The Hallows' Eve program was the joint efforts of multiple units across Colleges Nine and Ten, including the Dining Hall, the CoCurricular Programs Office, Activities, Residential Life, and Service-Learning. Families from Beach Flats and UCSC Family/Student Housing were also invited. Lu said that such programs also benefit UCSC students, especially first-generation college students who may feel disconnected on campus.</p>
<p>"We truly believe that our campus/community efforts foster retention among our students," Lu said, "and it sends a message of what is important."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a6876c678072701704be48b5f2cd009b"><name>gillman-miller-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>50th anniversary brought focus, collaboration for the future</title><summary>By Susan Gillman and Tyrus Miller, co-chairs of the 50th Anniversary Campus Coordinating Committee – The planning process for the 50th brought the campus to a new level of coordination and sophistication.

First, we want to thank our fellow committee members and the hundreds of students, staff, faculty, alumni, and community members whose efforts, ingenuity, and passion for UC Santa Cruz came together to make the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary a resounding success.</p>
<p>The planning process for the 50th brought the campus to a new level of coordination and sophistication. Staff and faculty across divisions who usually work relatively isolated from one another were able to pull together to showcase exceptional research, faculty, and students, and highlight distinguished alumni's impact on the world.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to point out a few highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>In January, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/angela-davis-speaks-at-mlk-convocation.html">Professor Emerita Angela Davis drew more than 1,900 people</a> to the Rev. Martin Luther King Convocation at the Civic Auditorium.</li>
<li>Nearly 600 people attended Brandeis University professor of law, public policy, and women&#8217;s studies <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/02/anita-hill-on-campus.html">Anita Hill&#8217;s talk in February</a>.</li>
<li>In April, we sponsored the local <a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/social-affairs/20150424/tedxsantacruz-speakers-present-radical-ideas">TEDx event at the Rio Theatre</a>. It sold out with 700 attendees. Thirteen of the 23 speakers were affiliated with UC Santa Cruz, providing significant visibility for a range of our research endeavors.</li>
<li>We saw an 18 percent increase in alumni attending <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/04/50th-alumni-weekend-feature-story.html">April&#8217;s Alumni Weekend</a> over the previous year, with 2,486 attendees; 1,613 of them alumni. Even more significantly, 962 people, including 609 alumni, made Alumni Weekend 2015 the first event they ever attended hosted by UC Santa Cruz.</li>
<li>In November, the Santa Cruz Chamber of Commerce gave UC Santa Cruz its <a href="http://www.santacruzchamber.org/CWT/EXTERNAL/WCPAGES/WCNEWS/NEWSARTICLEDISPLAY.ASPX?ArticleID=1225">Organization of the Year award</a>.</li>
<li>And finally, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/fiat-fifty-feature-story-2015.html">Founders weekend in September</a> was a one-of-a-kind event that engaged the entire campus. More than 70 pioneer faculty and staff from 1964 to 1967 attended. The Fiat 50 event was the largest sit-down dinner ever held in Santa Cruz, serving seated dinner to 750 guests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The increased engagement, focus, and visibility helped the campus attract&#160;private&#160;funding for eight new endowed faculty chairs across a full range of disciplines as well as in the&#160;University Library, bringing the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/awards/endowed-chairs.html">campus total to 30</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/11/presidential-chairs.html">new endowed chairs</a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kenneth R. Corday Family Presidential Chair in Writing for Television and Film (Division of the Arts)</li>
<li>Symantec Presidential Chair in Storage and Security (Baskin School of Engineering)</li>
<li>Sage Weil Presidential Chair for Open Source Software (Baskin School of Engineering)</li>
<li>Jordan-Stern Presidential Chair for Dickens and 19th Century Literature Studies (Division of the Humanities)</li>
<li>Richard L. Press University Librarian Presidential Chair (Library)</li>
<li>The Faggin Family Presidential Chair for the Physics of Information (Division of Physical and Biological Sciences)</li>
<li>Wilton W. Webster Jr. Natural Reserves Presidential Chair (Division of Physical and Biological Sciences)</li>
<li>Stephen R. Gliessman Presidential Chair in Water Resources and Food System Sustainability (Division of Social Sciences)</li>
</ul>
<p>This boost in resources for faculty research came as campus supporters seized the opportunity to match funds committed by UC President Janet Napolitano and in turn helped the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz pass $215 million this year, keeping us on target to reach our $300 million goal during 2017-18.</p>
<p>Even more critical, the 50th fostered a unified perspective that did not previously exist, enabling us to think as one campus, the total being greater than the sum of the parts. We were able to increase our visibility and deepen our connections to the early alumni, faculty and staff, and connect them back to today's students and campus.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we believe UC Santa Cruz will continue to benefit from thinking and acting in these collaborative ways so that when we reach out as a campus our work is well coordinated to ensure we make the most of our efforts and resources.</p>

<p>Swink comes to UC Santa Cruz with 10 years of successful game development experience as an independent game designer and developer, with credits on more than 10 independently developed games, most recently <em>Gravity Ghost</em>. She has taught game design and prototyping at Columbia College in Chicago for the past five years. Swink is a frequent speaker at national and international conferences, such as the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and Gaming Insiders Summit. With a background in neuroscience, she has written and lectured on the connections between neuroscience and games.</p>
<p>"We're excited to have Erin bring her tremendous skills and knowledge in indie game development to our students," said Michael John, program director of the M.S. in games and playable media program. "Her story as both a creative and highly successful indie developer will bring awesome perspective and opportunity to students in the games and playable media program. We are also excited by Erin's commitment to games as a broad cultural practice, evidenced by her recent first place in NOAA's <a href="https://www.climate.gov/teaching/professional-development/national-climate-game-jam">National Climate Game Jam</a>, and her successful #beatthedev charity fundraiser."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Creative vision</strong></p>
<p>As creative director, Swink will develop the overall creative vision for the program, consistent with the goal of pushing forward the expressive potential of games as a medium. She will also represent the M.S. program to the international game development community through talks and interviews, as well as by developing and exhibiting her own creative projects.</p>
<p>Swink said she was excited to join the team at UCSC's <a href="https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/">Center for Games and Playable Media</a> as creative director of the professional degree program. "I can't wait to help tomorrow's game developers create innovative and inspiring work," she said. "I hope that my experience as both an independent developer and an entrepreneur helps our students understand the challenges of our industry and face them head on."</p>
<p>The M.S. in games and playable media is a yearlong (12-month) degree focused on combining technical and design innovation. The program includes a project-oriented course sequence in which students work in teams to create innovative games. As creative director, Swink will be the instructor and mentor for the M.S. students during the course.</p>
<p>UCSC art professor and noted game designer Robin Hunicke said she was thrilled to have Swink joining the program. "We are creating a unique interdisciplinary program here that spans the Arts and Engineering divisions, enriching undergraduate and graduate education in games," Hunicke said. "Erin's experience as a game designer, artist, coder and advocate make her the perfect fit for us. We welcome her passionate belief that games are art, and her conviction that we can make a lasting and measurable difference through that art."</p>
<p>Swink joins several other recent hires in the games and playable media program, including program director Michael John (formerly at Glasslab) and computational media professor Katherine Isbister (formerly at New York University). "With these and other planned hires, we aim to build the top research and education destination for game students and faculty," Hunicke said. "We are excited to have Erin on board, helping us make that vision a reality."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://livelyivy.com/</url><title>Erin Robinson Swink's web site</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://gpm.soe.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Games and Playable Media M.S.
