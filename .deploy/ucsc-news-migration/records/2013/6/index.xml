The resulting prototypes include a mobile climate lab that measures air pollution and other environmental data and displays it on Google Maps; an organic LED desk lamp that uses an order of magnitude less energy than a conventional lamp; a Netflix movie recommendation app for smart phones; an app using gamification and crowd-sourcing to help eBay sellers provide good photos of their products; and a high-speed face detection system for images and live video.</p>
<p>"This is new technology created by undergraduates," said Art Ramirez, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. "It's great experience for the students, and it gives the corporate sponsors an opportunity to see what our students are capable of."</p>
<p>The engineering school's Corporate Sponsored Senior Project Program, now in its second year, held a Senior Design Partners Day on Thursday, May 30, featuring student presentations and demonstrations.</p>
<p>Pat Mantey, associate dean for industry programs and director of the program, said he enjoys watching a group of students develop as a team and learn to work together effectively. "When they have 20 weeks to work on a focused project, that's when everything really gels for them. They learn to work as an engineer in the real world--how to plan, manage a budget, and work in teams in a diverse environment," Mantey said.</p>
<p>The corporate sponsors this year include Altera, Applied Materials, CITRIS, Dell KACE, eBay, Echelon, Google, Netflix, Oracle, Raytheon Applied Signal Technology, Xilinx, and Yaskawa. Mentors from each company provided guidance and technical support for the student teams.</p>
<p>William McGrath, a student on the Applied Materials team, said the OLED desk lamp project was very challenging, but well worth the hard work and long hours that went into it. "I feel much more prepared now to go into an engineering job," he said.</p>
<p>"Working on a project like this is a great experience because you learn a lot of practical things that you don't learn in classes," said Carol Owens, a member of the Google mobile climate lab team.</p>
<p>Teaching fellow David Munday, who worked closely with many of the student teams, emphasized the importance of system-level integration and design. "In today's increasingly networked world, you need to think about how your product can be integrated with other technologies," he said.</p>
<p>At Thursday's event, Munday gave a demonstration of how four student teams were able to integrate their projects. The demonstration began with an accelerated face detection system developed by the Altera team and running on a PC. When the system detected Munday's face (through a standard web cam), it greeted him in a computerized voice and told him that it was launching the Google climate lab website (which appeared on the screen) and turning on the Applied Materials OLED lamp (which then illuminated a desk at the front of the room). The wireless signal that turned on the lamp was sent using the Echelon team's networking platform.</p>
<p>"I gave them this assignment Tuesday night, and they had it working by Thursday morning," Munday said.</p>
<p>Linda Werner, an adjunct professor of computer science who helped students working on several software projects, said teamwork and communication are critical skills the students learned from their projects. They also learned to work within the constraints specified by their corporate sponsors, she said. "For Netflix, for example, the user experience is critical, and what the user sees is strictly prescribed, so that was an interesting thing for the students to navigate in building a mobile app," Werner said.</p>
<p>In addition to the corporate-sponsored projects, the presentations included three teams without corporate sponsorship: a remote-controlled quadcopter device; a robotic lifeguard to help rescue struggling swimmers; and robot for collecting extraterrestrial samples, which is an entry in the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/index.html">NASA Centennial Challenge</a> competition.</p>
<p>"We included these projects to show that we have a lot of student talent and plenty of opportunities for additional corporate sponsorships," Mantey said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0ad17bf28072704668860b1d1c9220d4"><name>lick-concert-series</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Music of the Spheres draws summer visitors to Lick Observatory</title><summary>Lick Observatory's summer concert series features music, lectures, and star-gazing on Mt.

Retreat on Oregon&#8217;s Mount Hood, focusing on renewable energy.</p>
<p>He and 19 other young leaders were chosen from a large pool of applicants and placed in one of four categories &#8211; Technician, Innovator, Politico, or Storyteller. Coccia was selected for the &#8220;Politico&#8221;category.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to working with other individuals with similar core beliefs but entirely different skill sets,&#8221; Coccia said.</p>
<p><a href="http://focusthenation.org/programs/recharge">Focus the Nation, a national non-profit organization</a>, recognized these young minds as top rising leaders in the sustainable energy sector.&#160;</p>
<p>Coccia and his team will hike Elliot Glacier, which has lost 60 percent of its snowpack since 1982; tour the Boardman Coal Plant, scheduled to close by 2020; visit the Dalles Dam, located on the Columbia River and producing hydropower since 1957; and visit &#160;Biglow Canyon Wind Farm, which powers 125,000 homes in rural Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
When the twenty leaders return home, they will put what they learned at the retreat to use on their campus and in their communities. By doing so, they will be able to promote sustainable energy solutions.&#160;</p>
<p>Focus the Nation created ReCharge! in collaboration with The Center for Whole Communities to address the need for rising leaders to approach energy challenges with innovative ideas and fortitude throughout their careers.&#160;</p>
<p>ReCharge! is sponsored by Bonneville Power Administration, EDP Renewables, KEEN Footwear, and Portland General Electric. Since 2008, the organization has helped more than 300,000 young people have dialogues with business and elected leaders about energy solutions.&#160;<br/>

<br/>
The new mural is in collaboration with Oxfam America, the U.S. arm of the international organization that works to right the wrongs of poverty, hunger, and injustice. Students dedicated the new mural May 28.<br/>
<br/>
Both projects were facilitated by Diana Gilon, a New York-based community mural artist. Gilon said the design includes slogans inspired by Oxfam's belief system such as, "stand strong against injustice," "poverty is solvable," "sustainable solutions," and "community change." An Oxfam photo is also part of the design.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
College Nine's theme "International and Global Perspectives" is also prominent in the new mural. Provost Helen Shapiro said College Nine has a long-standing relationship with Oxfam. "We sponsor the UCSC Oxfam Club and have sent students to their leadership programs for several years now," she said, and the mural reflects a larger engagement with the organization.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/05/mural.html</url><title>Coverage of earlier mural</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="109ee5378072704668860b1d2473c701"><name>student-achievement-2013-advance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Celebrating excellence: Student Achievement Week 2013</title><summary>This year's Student Achievement Week recognizes high achievement across the disciplines.

<p>Much of their labors take place outside of the limelight, in recital halls, laboratories, library study areas and art studios.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://honors.ucsc.edu/saw/">Student Achievement Week,</a> from June 3 to 7, gives plenty of exposure, and highly public recognition, to students in a variety of fields and disciplines. Engineers, humanities scholars, actors, biology majors and printmakers will all have their time in the spotlight.</p>
<p>Students will present their work at a range of events including the ever-popular <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/ucsc-student-print-sale">UCSC Student Print Sale</a>, various art exhibitions, theater productions, and the Physical &amp; Biological Sciences Division and Baskin School of Engineering&#8217;s 15<sup>th</sup> annual <a href="http://urps.soe.ucsc.edu/">Undergraduate Research Poster Symposium</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://honors.ucsc.edu/saw/2013-schedule.html">events schedule</a> highlights UCSC&#8217;s strengths across the disciplines.</p>
<p>The arts are out in force this year, and the Baskin Visual Arts Center and Digital Arts Research Center should have plenty of visitors.</p>
<p>There is always a bustling crowd at the print sale, set for Friday, June 7, and Saturday, June 8, this year. Expect a large group of well-wishers and other visitors at another highly anticipated arts event, <a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/printsale/openstudios.html">Open Studios</a>, which features student artwork in a variety of media, &#160;and will take place at on Friday from noon to 4 p.m. at the Baskin Visual Arts Center and Digital Arts Research Center (DARC).</p>
<p>The Chancellor&#8217;s Award Ceremony is set for Friday, June 7. Award recipients and their faculty mentors will be honored at a private luncheon. &#160;One of the ceremony&#8217;s annual highlights is the Steck Family Award, which honors the best senior thesis completed during the academic year. The winner is chosen from the Chancellor's Award candidates.</p>
<p>In keeping with UCSC tradition, the identity of the winner will remain a secret until the end of the ceremony.</p>
<p>These honors showcase two enduring values at UCSC -- the focus on transformative undergraduate experiences on campus, and the importance of research as part of the learning process.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/06/student-achievement-honoree-2012.html</url><title>Read

<br/>
Eight engaging documentary films will be presented&#8212;shot in locations ranging from Africa and India, to Cuba and the Pajaro Valley&#8212; beginning at 6 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
Exploring hot&#8211;button issues captured across the nation and around the world, this year&#8217;s crop of films examines food justice, women's rights, immigration, the criminal justice system, and a bevy of other social and environmental issues.<br/>
<br/>
The filmmakers and several of the main characters will be in attendance and available after the screenings for questions.</p>
<p>Two of the films take a critical look at the criminal justice system in the United States<strong>--Comrade Sunshine</strong>, spotlights a re-entry program for prisoners in Baltimore, while <strong>Ghosts Of March 21</strong> focuses on the underlying contradictions behind a deadly shoot-out in Oakland.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Whose Serengeti?</strong> depicts the collision of the vastly different agendas driving development, conservation, and globalization at the site of a proposed highway through the Serengeti National Park.</p>
<p><strong>Vida Diferida</strong> (Life, Deferred) tells the coming-of-age story of an undocumented teenager in New Mexico, and <strong>Guajiros</strong> follows two Haitian students as they explore Cuba&#8217;s world-renowned agricultural system.</p>
<p><strong>Growing People</strong> portrays the lives of three sisters who reconnect to their heritage through their work on a farm in Hawaii, while <strong>Laal Pari: Not A Fairy Tale</strong> addresses women&#8217;s participation in politics at the grassroots level in rural India.</p>
<p>And <strong>Lonche</strong> trails two separate food trucks on their daily routines in the P&#225;jaro Valley and Silicon Valley, each dealing with a completely different clientele.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2005, UCSC&#8217;s <a href="http://film.ucsc.edu/socdoc">Social Documentation Program</a> has paired film students with faculty in a wide variety of departments, enabling deep research into film subjects and the roots of complex issues and cultures.</p>

<p>Instead, the soon-to-be <a href="http://scicom.ucsc.edu/">Science Communication</a> graduate talks about the connection she made with Betsy Rapoport, a professional editor and former executive editor at Random House who serves as one of the magazine's life coaches.</p>
<p>"That's a connection that won't go away," Devitt says. "When it's time for me to write a book, I'll have that connection."</p>
<p>The opportunity to make those important links and also to put learning into practice is what drew the 52-year-old veterinarian to UC Santa Cruz's Science Communication Program and a mid-life career change as a journalist.</p>
<p>With internships at the <em>Monterey County Herald,</em> Stanford University Medical School, and the <em>San Jose Mercury News</em> already on her resume, Devitt says the program not only gave her the chance to write breaking news stories &#8212; like the discovery of the H1N1 flu virus in elephant seals &#8212; but also allowed her to develop working relationships with editors and other writers.</p>
<p>"Any time you get to practice what you've studied, it amplifies what you learned in the classroom," Devitt says. "That's where the rubber hits the road. That's the proving ground, and that's what gives you connections."</p>
<p>Devitt's path to UCSC was a long one. For 25 years, she worked as a contract veterinarian for animal hospitals both on the East and West coasts. She did surgery, worked as an oil spill consultant for avian and marine mammals, and even cared for an elephant once.</p>
<p>But journalism always tugged at Devitt, and that pull grew stronger as she got older.</p>
<p>"I felt like I could have more impact with a pen rather than a scalpel," Devitt says. "I wanted more reach."</p>
<p>When Devitt discovered the Science Communication Program in the town where she already lived, "it was like putting gas to a match," she says. Even though it had been decades since she'd been in school, she knew that's what she wanted.</p>
<p>Helped by a scholarship from the ARCS Foundation and buoyed by occasional work as a veterinarian, Devitt plunged into her new career. As the oldest in her class (the youngest is 22), Devitt says the Science Communication Program is "extremely practical" &#8212; a fact that helped her win a prestigious internship at the Manhattan offices of <em>Nature Medicine</em> this summer.</p>
<p>Sitting outside a beach-area coffeeshop, the runner and triathlete says she's driven by her desire to educate people about the ever-changing natural world, to alert humans to coming problems, and to make a difference on a large scale.</p>
<p>One of her passions, for instance, is the One Health Initiative, which links human, animal and environmental health disciplines for a shared purpose.</p>
<p>"People don't share the planet with other animals very well," Devitt says. But the space that divides us is shrinking. And the more crowded our territory becomes, the more chances we have to cause conflicts and trade diseases.</p>
<p>It's high-impact stories like those that Devitt hopes to pursue in her new career.</p>
<p>"It takes faith to follow your heart," Devitt says. "But doors always open when you put your dreams in gear. The hard part is keeping up."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1173b1258072704668860b1d1ad0be34"><name>carson-watts</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'I recognize I can make a difference'</title><summary>Student Carson Watts's experience in a Ghanaian slum confirmed his career path of sustainable development.</summary><keywords>Carson Watts</keywords><start-date>1370332800000</start-date><display-name>'I recognize I can make a difference'</display-name><path>/2013/06/carson-watts</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/06/carson-watts</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1370387362034</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1371579213075</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/Carson Watts.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/Carson Watts.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Carson Watts.jpg</name><display-name>Carson Watts.jpg</display-name><file-size>48893</file-size><width>300</width><height>449</height></image><image-alt>Carson Watts</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/Carson Watts thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/Carson Watts thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Carson Watts thumb.jpg</name><display-name>Carson Watts thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18159</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Carson Watts</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Carson Watts (Oakes '13, sociology)&#160;hopes to get a Ph.D. in sustainable development.

<p>Home to nearly 100,000 people, the shantytown is a collection of dusty alleys, wooden shacks, and a sanitation system that consisted of trash haulers and latrine operators dumping their loads of waste into a fetid lagoon at the edge of the slum. A nearby e-waste disposal site was the reason for the black smoke.</p>
<p>Watts, who hopes to get a Ph.D. in sustainable development, was soon talking to residents and government officials in an attempt to understand why such unhealthy conditions existed and what could be done to improve them.</p>
<p>Old Fadama's residents said trash bins and public toilets would solve much of the problem&#8212;but the government only wanted the slum to be erased. Make something happen, the residents implored Watts.</p>
<p>"I felt a great sense of responsibility," said the 24-year-old community college transfer student who went to Ghana through UCSC's Education Abroad Program.</p>
<p>Now Watts is not only writing his senior thesis from research gathered during the five-month trip but he is also planning to write a position paper to send to Ghanaian officials outlining what he discovered.</p>
<p>"It was eye-opening to see the poverty there," Watts said of his time in the slums, "but it also confirmed my career path."</p>
<p>One day, Watts hopes to work in the sustainable development field both at home and abroad. Meanwhile, he has already lined up his first job out of college. He will be working for a grassroots campaign that fundraises for environmental and social justice issues.</p>
<p>A young man who grew up in a working-class family in the Sierra foothills &#8212; and has worked summers as a river guide &#8212; Watts also is passionate about the environment.</p>
<p>At UCSC, he coordinated a green building campaign for the campus's Student Environmental Center, constructing an educational cob oven and helping develop a green audit system for buildings on campus.</p>
<p>That dedication to social issues and public service is what landed Watts the $2,500 Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship at UCSC recently. The award was established in honor of Gabe Zimmerman, who died in the January 2011 shooting that killed five people and wounded U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Started by two UCSC alums and garnering more than $90,000 in contributions, it is given to a student who is dedicated to social issues and working to better the world.</p>
<p>"To be in higher education is to be in an incredible position of power to do something," Watts said. "I recognize I can make a difference. To see a problem and do nothing would just be a crime."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1178a48a8072704668860b1d1921e94b"><name>emerson-glassey</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Finding the correlations</title><summary>Nineteen-year-old senior Emerson Glassey wrote a software program that rapidly analyzes compounds produced by bacteria, which could help in the development of new drugs.</summary><keywords>Emerson Glassey</keywords><start-date>1370332800000</start-date><display-name>Finding the correlations</display-name><path>/2013/06/emerson-glassey</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/06/emerson-glassey</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1370387686467</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1371579341995</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/Emerson Glassey.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/Emerson Glassey.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Emerson Glassey.jpg</name><display-name>Emerson Glassey.jpg</display-name><file-size>38174</file-size><width>300</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt>Emerson Glassey</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/Emerson Glassey thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/Emerson Glassey thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Emerson Glassey thumb.jpg</name><display-name>Emerson Glassey thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21361</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Emerson Glassey</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Emerson Glassey&#8212;a young senior, at 19&#8212;is completing a project with Assistant Professor of Chemistry Roger Linington that may change the way researchers discover compounds in marine bacteria for use in the development of new drugs.

<p>He'd finished high school in two years, gone to junior college, and begun looking for a university to attend. Despite a stack of applications, however, only UC Berkeley and UCSC accepted the teen. UCSC was his pick.</p>
<p>Other schools' rejections were UCSC's gain. The 19-year-old, who will graduate this year, is completing a project with UCSC Assistant Professor of Chemistry Roger Linington that may change the way researchers discover compounds in marine bacteria for use in the development of new drugs.</p>
<p>The biochemistry and molecular biology major, and bioinformatics minor, has his eye on research and teaching at a university some day.</p>
<p>Born in the tiny town of Willitts, Calif., Glassey came to love science thanks to his older siblings and a biology teacher at the charter high school he attended. By the time most kids were thinking about junior prom, Glassey was working in a lab run by Stanford Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering Alexander Dunn. The lab was studying the rate at which collagen is snipped by enzymes when it is stretched. The research had implications for cancer metastasis and embryo development &#8212; and netted Glassey's name on a paper published by the Journal of the American Chemical Society.</p>
<p>He was 18.</p>
<p>But it is his work with Linington at UCSC that most excites Glassey. Collaborating with graduate student Kenji Kurita, Glassey wrote a software program that rapidly analyzes compounds produced by bacteria.</p>
<p>Instead of taking months to identify new compounds in these bacteria and find out how these compounds affect cells, this new analysis tool requires only minutes to do the same work. It could have far-reaching implications for the development of new drugs from natural products.</p>
<p>But the beauty of the program, which uses classical probabilistic models and vector manipulation, is that it is not limited to natural products research. It can be used to compare and find correlations between almost any two data sets.</p>
<p>Glassey plans to work in Linington's lab for one more year before going to graduate school and pursuing a career in research.</p>
<p>"I found what I enjoy, and what I'm proficient at," he said.</p>
<p>Winner of the prestigious Bunnett Undergraduate Research Award, Glassey is not only a member of UCSC's bike-racing team but also a fan of posting YouTube videos featuring slime mold and combustible compounds, fodder for any budding scientist &#8212; and a hit with his younger relatives.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="150b16128072704668860b1dbfc1fc89"><name>global-alliance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Genomics pioneers look to future, form global alliance for data sharing</title><summary>UCSC bioinformatics expert David Haussler is on organizing committee for global alliance to enable secure sharing of genomic and clinical data.</summary><keywords>David Haussler, genomics, global alliance</keywords><start-date>1370419200000</start-date><display-name>Genomics pioneers look to future, form global alliance for data sharing</display-name><path>/2013/06/global-alliance</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/06/global-alliance</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1370447615422</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1370968477669</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/03/images/haussler-178.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/03/images/haussler-178.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>haussler-178.jpg</name><display-name>haussler-178.jpg</display-name><file-size>51165</file-size><width>178</width><height>238</height></image><image-alt>david haussler</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/03/images/haussler-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/03/images/haussler-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>haussler-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>haussler-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24990</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>david haussler</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>David Haussler</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC Santa Cruz bioinformatics expert David Haussler is on organizing committee for global alliance to enable secure sharing of genomic and clinical data</article-subhead><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, is among more than 70 leading research, health care, and disease advocacy organizations that have taken the first steps to form an international alliance dedicated to enabling secure sharing of genomic and clinical data.</p>
<p>David Haussler, distinguished professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the <a href="http://cbse.soe.ucsc.edu/">Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering</a> at UC Santa Cruz, is a member of the alliance's organizing committee. He said the alliance, now in the beginning stages of formation, is planning for a future in which genome sequencing will be widely used in clinical medicine, given the rapidly falling cost of sequencing. The resulting wealth of genomic data, integrated with clinical information, could greatly accelerate progress in biomedical research if this information can be shared by researchers without compromising the principles of patient consent and confidentiality. In addition, the interpretation of an individual patient's genome in clinical practice would be transformed by the ability to compare it to a large, shared compendium of genomic and clinical data, creating a new era of precision medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Technological infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>"Understanding the role of genome sequence in disease will require a technological infrastructure adequate to analyze millions of genomes with associated clinical information," Haussler said. "If we design it up front for interoperability, and to include the mechanisms needed to manage privacy and consent, we will accelerate progress immeasurably."</p>
<p>In late January, Haussler and 49 colleagues from eight countries met to discuss the current challenges and opportunities in genomic research and medicine. They concluded that the greatest need was a common framework of international standards designed to enable and oversee how genomic and clinical data are shared in an effective, responsible, and interpretable manner. They envisioned a trusted and authoritative international partnership, intended to include leading healthcare providers, research institutions, disease advocacy groups, life science and information technology companies, and others, to facilitate this.&#160;</p>
<p>Following the circulation of a white paper, more than 70 organizations from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America have joined together to form a non-profit global alliance that will work to develop this common framework, which will enable researchers and clinicians to learn from shared data while protecting participant autonomy and privacy. Each organization, including UC Santa Cruz, has signed a non-binding Letter of Intent, pledging to work together to create a not-for-profit, inclusive, public-private, international, non-governmental organization (modeled on the World Wide Web Consortium, W3C) that will develop this common framework. They have committed to furthering innovation by supporting the creation of open technology standards to support the development of interoperable information technology platforms that will embody these principles and accelerate progress in biomedicine.</p>
<p><strong>Questions of ethics, privacy</strong></p>
<p>Member organizations recognize that when discussions occur about sharing large amounts of data, important questions about ethics and privacy naturally arise. Accordingly, members have committed to work together to establish a framework so that participants will have the right to share genomic and clinical information to advance human health as broadly or narrowly as they are comfortable with, including not at all.</p>
<p>Haussler is one of eight organizing committee members, along with David Altshuler from the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT; Peter Goodhand and Thomas Hudson from the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research; Brad Margus from the A-T Children's Project; Betsy Nabel from Brigham and Women's Hospital; Charles Sawyers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering; and Michael Stratton from Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.</p>
<p>"Medicine is in the midst of a revolution, and as we enter the era of precision medicine and widespread genome sequencing, we are at a crossroad," said Betsy Nabel, M.D., president of the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and a former director of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute at NIH. "If we continue to work in silos, each lacking the critical mass of data and methods needed to make progress and care for patients we will miss this tremendous opportunity to improve human health and save lives. The physicians and scientists of Brigham and Women's Hospital believe that, through the work of the global alliance, we will have access to the data we need to realize the promise of genomic medicine."</p>
<p>"Cancer is one of the earliest and most compelling areas of medicine in which genomics is providing benefit to patients," said Charles Sawyers, chair of the Program in Human Oncology and Pathogenesis at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and president of the American Association for Cancer Research. "Our ability to provide accurate information to patients, and to learn why some people respond to therapy and others do not, requires the international approach and shared standards that the alliance aims to create."</p>
<p><strong>Experience with genome databases</strong></p>
<p>Haussler's group at UC Santa Cruz brings extensive experience with large genome databases and the Internet-based exchange of biomedical knowledge. His team created the computational infrastructure to assemble the first draft human genome sequence and used this assembly as a basis for building the <a href="https://cbse.soe.ucsc.edu/research/browser">UCSC Genome Browser</a>, the most popular tool for accessing human genomic data. They recently built the cancer genomics database for the National Cancer Institute, the <a href="https://cghub.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Cancer Genomics Hub</a> (CGHub), currently the largest shared cancer genome database in the world. All of this work relies on novel ideas and creative methods in bioinformatics developed at UC Santa Cruz for the purpose of making sense of mountains of genomic data.</p>
<p>According to Haussler, the global alliance aims to work with partners and operating entities to develop the infrastructure and technology platforms needed to enable the sharing and integration of genomic and clinical data in a manner that is secure, controlled, and protective of participant autonomy, privacy, and security. These platforms not only would serve biomedical researchers, but could also support diagnostic services for medical practitioners.</p>
<p>"We want to create the infrastructure that will enable clinical applications as well as academic research to flourish," Haussler said. "UCSC's expertise in large-scale genome databases will enable the global alliance to eliminate the barriers to research and precision medicine created by the current non-interoperable medical information silos."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://cbse.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/global_alliance_white_paper_060313.pdf</url><title>White Paper: Creating a Global Alliance to Enable Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Clinical Data</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://cbse.soe.ucsc.edu/research/global_alliance</url><title>List of Alliance Partners</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/health/global-partners-agree-on-sharing-trove-of-genetic-data.html?ref=science&amp;_r=0</url><title>New York Times: Accord Aims to Create Global Trove of Genetic Data</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="153eb3868072704668860b1d4b02aded"><name>ice-sheets</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Major study assesses sea level changes due to ice sheet losses </title><summary>Improved satellite measurements and computer simulations of ice sheets are creating a more accurate picture of the current and future rise in global sea level.</summary><keywords>Slawek Tulaczyk, ice sheets, sea level rise, global warming</keywords><start-date>1370451600000</start-date><display-name>Major study assesses sea level changes due to ice sheet losses </display-name><path>/2013/06/ice-sheets</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/06/ice-sheets</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1370450998098</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1370451233765</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/glacial-meltwater-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/glacial-meltwater-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>glacial-meltwater-375.jpg</name><display-name>glacial-meltwater-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>112278</file-size><width>375</width><height>506</height></image><image-alt>glacial meltwater on greenland ice sheet</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/glacial-meltwater-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/glacial-meltwater-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>glacial-meltwater-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>glacial-meltwater-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21583</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>glacial meltwater on greenland ice sheet</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Melt water stream on the Greenland ice sheet.

<p>The team's study, published in the June 6 issue of <em>Nature,</em> found that Antarctic ice loss might be only half of what has previously been reported. But the researchers also confirmed a major loss of mass from the Greenland Ice Sheet, calculated to be twice as large as the Antarctic contribution to global sea-level rise.</p>
<p>The collaboration, led by Edward Hanna of the University of Sheffield, brought together scientists from twelve polar research centers across the world to study advances in both observations and simulations of ice-sheet mass changes.</p>
<p>Global sea level is currently rising at a rate just over three millimeters (about an eighth of an inch) per year, due to a combination of melting ice and the expansion of seawater driven by warming. Future increases in mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are expected to significantly enhance the rate of global sea-level rise as these ice-sheet changes become an increasingly dominant contributor. Considerable uncertainty remains in predictions, however, as ice sheets show a complex response to climate change, which is only now becoming apparent through the use of improved computer models.</p>
<p>The <em>Nature</em> paper, "Ice-sheet mass balance and climate change," shows how uncertainties in modeling methods have been reduced thanks to better theoretical understanding of ice sheet physics and advances in measurement techniques that make use of radar, laser, and satellite data. These advances allow scientists to better predict the impact of climate change on ice-sheet mass balance and global sea-level rise. Many of these improvements took place since the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report declared that understanding of ice sheet behavior was insufficient to reliably predict future evolution of ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland.</p>
<p>Tulaczyk, who has been studying the physics of ice sheet motion for the the past two decades, reviewed advances in how ice-sheet boundary conditions are treated in computer models. "Since the 2007 IPCC report, the pace of improvement in representing key ice sheet processes in numerical models has been really impressive," he said. "However, there are still significant gaps in knowledge, and assumptions used to bridge these gaps tend to make simulated ice sheets change relatively slowly over time. The danger is that this bias may make it difficult for computer models to predict a sharp acceleration in ice sheet contribution to the rate of future sea level rise."&#160;</p>
<p>Hanna, the paper's lead author, said estimates of mass change of ice sheets have begun to converge in the last year, although considerable uncertainty still remains concerning the current rate of mass change for the Antarctic Ice Sheet.</p>
<p>"We believe the current contribution to global sea-level rise from the Antarctic Ice Sheet might be only half that reported in some previous major studies just a year or two ago," Hanna said. "We also confirm previous results suggesting an accelerating major loss of mass, at double the Antarctic rate, from the Greenland Ice Sheet."</p>

<ul>
<li>Senate faculty and policy-covered (non-represented) academic employees will receive a 2 percent general salary increase.</li>
<li>Policy-covered (non-represented) staff employees will receive average increases of 3 percent (individual increases may vary), subject to the exclusions noted below.</li>
</ul>
These increases, which were part of the proposed 2013-14 budget approved by the Board of Regents this past November, are intended to acknowledge the fact that policy-covered employees have received only one general salary increase in the past five years. The increases are also intended to partially offset increased retirement and benefit costs that academic and staff employees have absorbed over the past few years.<br/>
 <br/>
 The following employee groups are excluded from the 2013-14 salary program:<br/>
 
<ul>
<li>Top senior management members, including the president, chancellors, executive and senior vice presidents and other senior managers who report directly to the president; medical center chief executive officers; direct reports to the Regents; certain other senior managers; and athletic coaches whose salaries are covered by multi-year contracts;</li>
<li>Union-represented employees (excluding Santa Cruz Faculty Association members).</li>
</ul>
While the 2013-14 salary program contains exclusions for staff employees who were recently hired or who have had promotional or equity increases exceeding 3 percent in the past 12 months, Chancellor Blumenthal has decided that the UCSC local program will be extended to this group.<br/>
 <br/>
 Detailed information regarding the 2013-14 salary plan and the campus implementation will be forthcoming. In the meantime, should you have any questions about the 2013-14 salary plan, please contact Staff Human Resources Compensation at <a href="mailto:sicily@ucsc.edu" target="_blank">sicily@ucsc.edu</a> or the Academic Personnel Office at <a href="mailto:apo@ucsc.edu" target="_blank">apo@ucsc.edu</a>.<br/>
 <br/>
 The budget cuts of the last several years have created many challenges &#8211; and sacrifices &#8211; for academic and staff employees, and we thank you for your continued dedication, service, and contributions to the University. <br/>

New analysis by ecologists at UC Santa Cruz demonstrates that even higher levels of biological diversity are necessary to maintain ecosystem health in larger landscapes over long periods of time.&#160;<br/> <br/> Think of it as patches on a quilt, says Erika Zavaleta, UCSC associate professor of environmental studies. Each patch may be a diverse habitat of plants, animals, and insects but it is equally important that the landscape &#8220;quilt&#8221; is made up of a diversity of patches that are different from each other.<br/> <br/> "A mix of meadows, young forest, old forest and shrub lands, for example, might provide more benefits than a landscape of continuous young forest, even if that young forest itself has high biodiversity," Zavaleta said.<br/> <br/> Zavaleta and two ecologists who recently received Ph.D.s from UCSC illustrate the importance of landscape diversity in their article "<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/05/31/1220333110">Several scales of bioversity affect ecosystem multifunctionality</a>" published this week in PNAS, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.<br/> <br/> Lead author Jae R. Pasari, who received his Ph.D. in 2011, conceived of the study for his dissertation. He, Zavaleta, and coauthor Taal Levi created simulations based on landmark research conducted by David Tilman, professor of ecology, evolution, and behavior at the University of Minnesota.<br/> <br/> Tilman &#8211; also a co-author &#8211; created 168 plots nine meters square and planted them with randomized combinations of perennial grassland species.&#160; He was interested in how the plots would fare depending on the combination of species included.<br/> <br/> Pasari, Levi, and Zavaleta took Tilman's data gathered since 1997 to create 7,512 experimental computerized landscapes. The computer simulations are grounded on very real data, Zavaleta said.<br/> <br/> "We used the simulation models to create imaginary landscapes with many kinds of habitats," she said. The team was able to test combinations of "patches" in order to determine the overall potential health of the "quilt."&#160;<br/> <br/> The authors write: "In addition to conserving important species, maintaining ecosystem multifunctionality will require diverse landscape mosaics of diverse communities."<br/> <br/> "What's new here," Zavaleta says, "is reminding us that it's not just important to protect a diversity of species but also important to protect the mosaic of habitat patches in a landscape."<br/> <br/> Conservation often emphasizes restoring land that has been mined, logged, or tilled, she said. Equally important is to recognize the role that restored landscape plays in a larger biotic community.<br/> <br/> Pasari now teaches at Berkeley City College and at Pacific Collegiate School in Santa Cruz. Levi received his Ph.D. last year and is a wildlife ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystems Studies in New York. Both were supported in their research with National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/05/31/1220333110</url><title>Paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1adcfd688072704668860b1d86fb05dc"><name>summery-summery-activities-2013</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Shakespeare, gardens, and ocean mysteries: summer attractions at UCSC</title><summary>The scenic campus remains vibrant and inviting in summer break, with a large number of attractions, sites, and programs for visitors. </summary><start-date>1370546520000</start-date><display-name>summery summary UCSC activities 2013</display-name><path>/2013/06/summery-summery-activities-2013</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/06/summery-summery-activities-2013</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1370545257598</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1371508616357</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Theater Arts</value><value>Music</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/seymour-center-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/seymour-center-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>seymour-center-1.jpg</name><display-name>seymour-center-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>20096</file-size><width>300</width><height>214</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/greenlaudations80thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/greenlaudations80thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>greenlaudations80thumb.jpg</name><display-name>greenlaudations80thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22235</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The Seymour Marine Discovery Center is a great place to learn about the ecology of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/HenryV350</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/HenryV350</link><site>news</site><name>HenryV350</name><display-name>HenryV350</display-name><file-size>28456</file-size></image><image-alt/><image-caption><em>Henry V</em> marks Artistic Director Marco Barricelli's return to the SSC stage.

<p>When the summer fog rolls in, UC Santa Cruz and its off-campus facilities roll out a long list of things to do and see, from artistic creations to al fresco Shakespeare in the redwoods to the mysteries of the deep.</p>
<p><strong>Intimate museums, eye-catching exhibits</strong></p>
<p>Summer is a good time to catch up with UCSC's unique art museums. The <a href="http://art.ucsc.edu/galleries/sesnon/current">Mary Porter Sesnon gallery</a> will host a lively exhibit highlighting the work of the latest Irwin Scholars through June 15. Each year, these 12 artists are handpicked by faculty to receive the most prestigious award in the Art Department at UCSC.</p>
<p>Visiting the gallery is a great excuse to visit the lovely Porter College, which offers breathtaking views of the Monterey Bay and has a famous koi pond, great for picnics and contemplative moments.</p>
<p>Over at Cowell College&#8212;which also features beautiful scenery and stunning views&#8212;the <a href="http://cowell.ucsc.edu/smith-gallery/">Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery,</a> with a strong emphasis on art of the Monterey Bay region, is hosting <em>Her Place: Visual Narratives</em> by Bonnie Stone, an exhibition that runs through June 22 at UCSC's Cowell College. Stone, who lives in nearby Saratoga, has been producing vivid watercolors for more than five decades.</p>
<p>And if you're looking for a quirky, historic, and truly one-of-a-kind museum-going experience, don't forget about the exhibits of <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/grateful-dead-archive/exhibits">Dead Central</a>, the exhibition space for the UCSC Grateful Dead Archive, housed at McHenry Library on campus. (<em>see below for more information on campus libraries</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>A place to learn in the redwoods</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/">McHenry and Science &amp; Engineering libraries</a> house 1.3 million bound volumes, access to more than 12,000 periodicals, newspapers and special materials, along with special materials such as manuscripts, maps, and slides. And the new refurbishing and expansion of the McHenry library&#8212;complete with <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/global-village-cafe">a new eatery close to the main entrance</a>&#8212;makes this research and study space more appealing than ever.</p>
<p>Most library resources are available to the public; borrowing privileges are available with a contribution to the Friends of UCSC Library or by joining the Alumni Association. Special Collections at McHenry Library contains rare, valuable and often fragile materials that do not circulate but can be viewed by appointment.

<p><a href="http://shakespearesantacruz.org/">Shakespeare Santa Cruz</a> will offer something refreshing and thoroughly sylvan this season: instead of holding half its performances indoors at the Main Stage as usual, SSC will stage every performance outdoors in the famous Stanley-Sinsheimer Festival Glen, where audiences will enjoy Shakespeare's <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> from July 23 through September 1; Henry V from August 6 &#8211; September 1, and Tom Jones (the Fringe Show) adapted from Jon Jory from the classic novel by Henry Fielding.</p>
<p>Shakespeare Santa Cruz is a professional repertory company in residence at UCSC. Tickets may be ordered <a href="http://www.shakespearesantacruz.org">online</a> or by phone at (831) 459-2159.</p>
<p><strong>Staying fit and having fun in the summertime</strong></p>
<p>You will be hard pressed to find any athletic training facility or full-service gym with a view like the one up at UCSC.</p>
<p>Whether you're running a lap on the pleasingly bouncy half-mile track, or trying out some newfangled cardio machine in the Wellness Center, you will lose yourself in the scenery. If the workout doesn't knock you out, the view surely will.</p>
<p>By purchasing a recreation/wellness card or paying a day-use fee, members of the community have access to UCSC's recreation facilities, which include tennis, racquetball, and basketball courts; wellness center; running track and playing fields. Prices vary. For information, call (831) 459-2531. Alumni Association members receive substantial discounts on cards and day-use fees. For information, call (831) 459-2530.</p>
<p><strong>Learning from the natural world</strong></p>
<p>The famous Arboretum awaits you this summer, but during your visit to UCSC, don't overlook other beautiful areas, including The Farm as well as the Alan Chadwick Garden.</p>
<p>Visitors to the UCSC Arboretum may stroll through its exotic gardens, go on a tour or take part in scheduled events. Admission is $5 for adults and $2 for children, and free on the first Tuesday of each month. Hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Norrie's Gift &amp; Garden Shop, a gift shop selling plants, pottery, jewelry and more, is open every day from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>The Arboretum is located on Empire Grade between the campus's main and west entrances. Visit arboretum.ucsc.edu or call 427-2998 for more information.</p>
<p><a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu/">The Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems</a> manages two locations: the 25-acre Farm near the main entrance to campus and the 2-acre Alan Chadwick Garden across McLaughlin Drive from Stevenson College.</p>
<p>Both the Farm and the <a href="http://www.alan-chadwick.org/html%20pages/gallery/ucsc_garden_today.html">Alan Chadwick Garden</a> are open to the public daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. with a self-guided tour brochure available at the Farm entrance. Groups may sign up for docent-led tours. Visitors will see first-hand how to build fertile soil and control pests, recycle yard and kitchen waste, conserve water and encourage biodiversity. Special events and classes are scheduled throughout the summer. For more information, visit the CASFS <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu">website</a> or call (831) 459-3240.</p>
<p><strong>Denizens of the deep</strong></p>
<p>Visitors can view one of the largest whale skeletons displayed worldwide, touch living sea stars and hermit crabs, and enjoy spectacular views of the Monterey Bay at the <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/visit/hours-admission/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a>, part of a UCSC marine research laboratory. Aquaria and exhibits feature the everyday tools of ocean exploration and focus on research done by scientists on site and around the world.</p>
<p>Skillful docents answer questions and lead tours at 1 p.m., 2 p.m., and 3 p.m. Summer hours in July and August are Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. Admission ranges from $4-$6.

<p><strong>Looking at the heavens</strong></p>
<p>The working <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/">Lick Observatory</a> is located atop Mount Hamilton, east of San Jose and about 60 miles from campus. It is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily from Memorial Day through Labor Day. (From Labor Day to Memorial Day, it will be open Thursday through Sunday, from noon to 5 p.m.)</p>
<p>The public is invited to view exhibits in the main observatory building, built in 1888. Enjoy an informal talk about the observatory history while taking a look at the Great Lick Refractor in the 36-inch telescope dome. These talks begin at the gift shop on each half hour beginning at 1 p.m. on weekdays and 12:30 p.m. on weekends, continuing until 4:30. Each talk is 15 minutes long and is free of charge.</p>
<p>Visitors also are invited to take a short walk to the Shane Dome to view the 120-inch reflector from the Visitors' Gallery. Displays explain the Shane reflector, one of the major telescopes used to discover planets outside our solar system. Special events also are scheduled, including a <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/public/music.html">Music of the Spheres program</a>, which takes place on June 15 and 29, July 13 and 27, and August 10 and 24, September 14 and 28. <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/06/lick-concert-series.html">This promises to be a dramatic and stirring season for stargazers and music lovers.</a> For more information, visit the Lick <a href="http://ucolick.org">website</a>. Reservations are strongly recommended; Music of the Spheres events tend to sell out quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Exploring the campus</strong></p>
<p>The Office of Admissions offers campus tours year-round on weekdays. Reservations are required, and tours fill early. The approximately two-hour tour program starts at the Office of Admissions &#8212; Cook House, near the campus's main entrance at Bay and High streets.

This training is designed to prepare our Police Department and local allied law enforcement agencies on how to respond to an Active Shooter incident, using the latest tactics and equipment available.<br/>
<br/>
 As such, the area around the Porter Dorm and the adjacent parking lot will be cordoned off by yellow tape and signs, and will be off-limits to anyone not participating in the training exercises. Entering and exiting from the parking lot will not be hindered. In addition, those near the area may hear sounds of screaming, simulated gun fire, and other noises as part of the training.<br/>
<br/>
 This training is expected to begin at about 8 a.m. and last throughout the day until 5 p.m., each day.<br/>
<br/>
 In addition to the Porter Dorm training exercises, on June 19, 2013, other Active Shooter training, will be held at the Early Childhood Center at Family Student Housing, from 8 a.m. to noon. The Center is closed this day, and there should be little to no disruption to the residents. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 A test of the Cruz Alert system will be conducted, with messages sent to only those participating in this training exercise,&#160; several times throughout the week.&#160; This test will be conducted as part of the requirements set forth in the Clery Act. The tests will be clearly indicated, and participants may receive text messages, emails and possibly office or home phone messages.<br/>
<br/>
 Neither of these trainings is open to the public. I apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause, but it is imperative that these activities take place.<br/>
<br/>
 If there are any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call the UC Santa Cruz Police Department at 831-459-2231.</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>UCSC Police Department</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1ff5eb098072704668860b1d84a148a4"><name>smoke-tobacco-free-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Request Campus Input About Proposed UC Santa Cruz Smoke &amp; Tobacco Free Policy</title><summary>We write to request campus input on the proposed UC Santa Cruz Smoke &amp; Tobacco Free Policy.</summary><start-date>1370332800000</start-date><display-name>Request Campus Input About Proposed UC Santa Cruz Smoke &amp; Tobacco Free Policy</display-name><path>/2013/06/smoke-tobacco-free-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/06/smoke-tobacco-free-policy</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1370630777553</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1370630819232</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div><span>We write to request campus input on the proposed UC Santa Cruz Smoke &amp; Tobacco Free Policy.

On Friday alone, there are 18 departmental or organizational celebrations scheduled throughout the day, resulting in hundreds of visitors needing on-campus parking. Parking in the East Remote lot will be free on Friday to accommodate many of them. However, traffic on campus will be much heavier than usual, and parking for some celebrations will be in close-in parking lots. Please consider coordinating with your supervisor to work off-site or from home on Friday, or consider using alternative transportation to get to campus. Metro buses serving the UCSC campus will be fare-free on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Campus shuttles will be operating on the summer intersession Loop bus schedule (starting at 7:30am) on Friday, with added evening Loop buses operating until 10pm. During the weekend campus shuttle service will operate from 7:30am to 7:30pm.<br/>
<br/>
If you routinely park on campus with a valid UCSC parking permit, you should be able to park in the lot you normally use on Friday. Display your permit as usual, and please don't park in spaces reserved for VIPs, "Special Pass" holders, or disabled visitors.<br/>
<br/>
If you will be on campus during the weekend, please be aware that traffic restrictions will be in place in two areas:&#160; downhill traffic on Hagar will be closed from Steinhart Drive to the East Remote parking lot, and downhill traffic on Heller will be closed from the Core West Parking Structure entrance to Meyer Drive. Those trying to exit from the campus core will be directed to do so via Coolidge Drive.<br/>
<br/>
If you have questions about parking on campus this weekend, please contact Eric Kraus at TAPS (459-2190).<br/>

<div><span>It is a pleasure to announce the approval of a new Master of Science program in Games and Playable Media. &#160;Offered by interdisciplinary faculty and administered by the Computer Science Department, the new M.S. will be located off the main campus at UCSC Silicon Valley. &#160;This graduate program provides students a pathway for professional training from the existing Computer Science: Computer Game Design B.S. major. Interested students are encouraged to contact the department directly: <a href="https://cs.soe.ucsc.edu/ms_gamesplayablemedia">https://cs.soe.ucsc.edu/ms_gamesplayablemedia</a><br/>
<br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>A new student pathway for the Education M.A. and preparation for the California Teaching Credential in Secondary Science will be offered in Silicon Valley in partnership with UCSC Extension. &#160;Contact the Education Department for information:&#160;<a href="http://education.ucsc.edu/academics/mac-info/learnmore-mac-silicon-valley/">http://education.ucsc.edu/academics/mac-info/learnmore-mac-silicon-valley/</a><br/>
<br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>The popular Community Studies B.A. major has been re-launched, and students may declare starting fall 2013. &#160;Oakes College is now the administrative home. &#160;Interested students should check the program&#8217;s web site: <a href="http://communitystudies.ucsc.edu/">http://communitystudies.ucsc.edu/</a><br/>
<br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>A new Spanish Studies B.A. major has been proposed by the Language Program and senate approval is anticipated soon. &#160;Courses will range from language and applied linguistics to senior seminars in Spanish addressing the culture of Spain and Latin American and Latino groups in the U.S. &#160;Students can declare the major starting fall 2013. Learn more about Spanish Studies at: <a href="http://language.ucsc.edu/">http://language.ucsc.edu/</a><br/>
<br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>The first Critical Race and Ethnics Studies course will be offered in Spring 2014, CRES 10, Introduction to Critical Race and Ethnic Studies. &#160;This is a prerequisite to two upper-division courses that are planned to be offered for the first time in 2014-15.<br/>
<br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Also this year, the campus has discontinued the Psychology minor and two concentrations in the Language Studies major, Modern Hebrew and Russian. Student demand was very low, and the curriculum was no longer sustainable.<br/>
<br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>There is a campus-wide effort underway to prepare for our next Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) accreditation, including further defining student based learning outcomes for each undergraduate and graduate major. &#160;Program learning outcomes will be posted on department websites for easy communication to all students. Assessment will be incorporated into department external reviews.

Supporting that fact is a new ranking that includes the campus among the top 10 feeder schools for&#160;City Year&#8217;s 2013-2014 corps. This coming school year, 20 UCSC graduates will join City Year, a national organization that unites young people for a year of service in 247 high-need schools across&#160;the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;University of California, Santa Cruz alumni who will serve with City Year next year share a strong desire to help our nation&#8217;s students meet their potential and stay in school and on track to graduation&#8221; said Michael Brown, CEO and Co-Founder of City Year. &#8220;City Year AmeriCorps members are a dedicated, talented group of inspirational young adults who will make a real difference in the schools where they serve, gaining valuable leadership skills during their service year. We are pleased to welcome UCSC graduates to the City Year family.&#8221;</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s set of UCSC Conferences caters to every imaginable taste.</p>
<p>Conference attendants will always find a special niche for themselves,&#160; whether they want to swim into the world of water polo at a <a href="http://www.ussportscamps.com/">Nike Sports Camp</a>, make their guitars talk at the <a href="http://www.rockcamp.org/">Soundwall Music Camp</a>, play and study at the <a href="http://www.mandolinsymposium.com/">Mandolin Symposium with David Grisman and Mike Marshall,</a> or ponder the <em>Mystery of Edwin Drood</em> at the always popular <a href="http://dickens.ucsc.edu/universe/">Dickens Universe</a> conference, which will feature an appearance by Gerald Dickens, great-great-grandson of Charles Dickens.&#160;</p>
<p>While the roughly&#160;<a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/conference/current-conferences.html">50 conference offerings</a>&#160;appeal to a wide age range, expect to see a large number of youthful faces this season.&#160;Roughly 7,000 of the estimated 9,000 conference participants are youth, some of them participating in outreach programs designed to increase their ability to get into top colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Others are the highest performers in their field of study and hope to challenge themselves in a rigorous college classroom environment.</p>
<p>Summer school could be a life changing experience for these students. For many, it will be their first in-depth, sustained exposure to the campus and its offerings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Youth who come here for summer programs may end up attending UCSC because of this experience, even if it's a non-traditional academic experience such as a sport camp,&#8221; said Martha Keeler, UCSC&#8217;s assistant director of conference services.</p>
<p>Here are just a few offerings for high-achieving youth:</p>
<p>Imagine spending your summer studying star and planet formation and cosmic evolution. The students at <a href="http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/ISSAC2013.html">the University of California High-Performance Astrocomputing Center&#8217;s International Summer School</a> will immerse themselves in large-scale simulations and planet-formation problems.&#160; This program is sponsored by UCSC.</p>
<p>High-achieving students interested in medical, pharmacy, nursing, biomedical research, or drug development careers, can learn molecular and cellular biology at the <span><a href="http://www.rosettainstitute.org/#!cancer-workshop/crty">Rosetta Institute of Biomedical Research Cancer Workshop, which offers engaging lectures and challenging laboratory classes</a></span>&#160; More broadly, the workshop strengthens academic skills and helps to ease the transition from high school to college.&#65279;</p>
</div>
<p>Mathematically gifted students from all around the world will take part <a href="https://www.awesomemath.org/summer-program/">in Awesome Math</a>, a three-week intensive summer camp. The camp is perfect for students who are hoping to become competitive at the math Olympiad level, and others who are just looking to expand their skills.</p>
<p>The average gross revenue of over $4 million, generated within a 10-week period, goes to UCSC&#8217;s housing system and helps offset what students pay during the academic year for housing and dining. Visiting students have the full range of campus living. They stay in campus housing and eat in college dining halls.</p>
<p>UCSC summer conferences have a longstanding reputation for eclecticism and professionalism. It&#8217;s a time to see new groups on campus, and welcome back groups that have a longstanding history at UCSC. For instance, the oldest conference group, USA Cheerleaders, has been coming back for more than 40 years.</p>
<p>Keeler attributed the conference program&#8217;s success to the setting as well as the programs&#8217; quality. &#8220;We are so lucky to have this beautiful environment,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The reputation of UCSC, and the natural setting, keep our programs very strong. We draw a national and international&#160; participant base.&#160; I want to thank the UCSC community for helping us welcome these summer visitors. &#8220;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3988b6c28072704668860b1d151e05e5"><name>steck-profile-kristoffer-hellen</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Steck Award winner shares stories of survival</title><summary>Kristoffer Hellén traveled to Europe and Russia, to find out why two small and vulnerable ethnic groups resist assimilation, hold onto their cultures, and survive.

<p>"Everyone likes a good survival story," Hell&#233;n said.</p>
<p>Now, UC Santa Cruz is honoring Hell&#233;n with the <a href="http://honors.ucsc.edu/awards/steck-info.html">2013 Steck Family Award</a>, which recognizes the best senior thesis completed in the academic year. It is the highest academic honor given to a UCSC undergraduate for a senior research project. Steck winners are chosen from a pool of 15 Chancellor's Award winners.&#160;</p>
<p>Loren Steck (Porter '73), a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee, was on hand to congratulate Hell&#233;n. Steck chairs the distinguished selection committee that chose to recognize Hell&#233;n's work. The Steck family created the endowment that funds the award, which includes a $1,000 prize.</p>
<p>Steck has described the award as a truly special honor for UCSC students: "Only the best undergraduates nowadays do senior theses," Steck said. "Only the best of the best of them receive Dean&#8217;s Awards. Only the best of the best of the best of them get Chancellor&#8217;s Awards."</p>
<p>Hell&#233;n transferred from Cabrillo College to UCSC during his junior year, was drawn to the Mari, a small ethnic group in Russia, whom he describes as "the mysterious cousins of the Finns." He felt a sense of kinship, considering that he is of Finnish ancestry.</p>
<p>The Mari are a Finno-Ugric people whose language is related to Finnish.</p>
<p>The Mari also happen to be the only animists in Europe. They are, literally, nature worshippers who pray in sacred natural areas. But the Mari live in constant close contact with people with dramatically different beliefs, including Muslims.</p>
<p>"They can identify themselves <em>against</em> them because they go to sacred natural sites to pray, instead of mosques," said Hell&#233;n.</p>
<p>Consequently the Mari have a sharpened sense of community, which also helped them reject the Orthodox Christianity -- the dominant religion of the Russian state.</p>
<p>But their location, though it figures in their long-term survival story, is not exactly a stroke of luck. The Mari have a history of intense persecution&#8212;about half of the group was wiped out during the so-called Cheremis Wars in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, and entire Mari villages were later driven into rivers and forcibly baptized in the 18<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>And their latest foe&#8212;assimilation&#8212;has reduced their numbers over the years.</p>
<p>Hell&#233;n,&#160;<a href="http://history.ucsc.edu/news-events/history-matters-archive/hm-sept-2012.html">who wrote about his travels in History Matters, a UCSC History Department e-journal</a>, was a bit nervous about visiting and studying them at first. &#8220;I just didn&#8217;t know what to expect." But he also felt a sense of urgency: "This was my chance to go. Somebody had agreed to host me. I had to go there right away &#8230;"</p>
<p>Now Hell&#233;n is earning high praise for his work. History professor Jonathan Beecher drew attention to his &#8220;excellent writing&#8221; as well as the sheer originality of his thesis. &#8220;I would simply say that Hell&#233;n goes far beyond the existing scholarship,&#8221; wrote Beecher in a letter of recommendation for the prize.</p>
<p>Gail Hershatter, distinguished professor of history and History Department chair,&#160; has also been singing his praises.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the kind of undergraduate humanities research we really like to encourage. We try to make it possible for students to do these projects and share them with others and to recognize them. We are just so full of pride" about Hell&#233;n&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Hell&#233;n said he hopes the Steck Award leads more people to read his thesis. He says he wants to help the Maris be proud of their history and heritage, and to raise awareness of this ethnic group.</p>
<p>This week, he returns to Finland, where he is going to attend a three-week Mari language program in Yoshkar-Ola and then a four-week Russian language program in Kazan.</p>

<br/>
The professorships are for five years and were established to bring senior international scholars to Denmark to host research programs &#8220;characterized by novelty, creativity, and excellence.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The award will support Tsing's research and teaching both in Denmark and at UC Santa Cruz. Tsing will establish a transdisciplinary program that will encompass the humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, and the arts in an exploration of what has been called the "Anthropocene." Anthropocene is that geologic epoch defined by human disturbance of the earth&#8217;s ecosystems.&#160;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Tsing calls her program&#160; "Living in the Anthropocene: Discovering the Potential of Unintended Design on Anthropogenic Landscapes." It will include conferences and fellowships for graduate students, post-docs, and colleagues. The project will sponsor a public conference next May at UCSC titled,&#160; "Imagining Life and Death in Difficult Times." Science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin will be a featured participant along with more than a dozen other scholars.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
The conference will also be the kickoff of the "Bateson Initiative," a program the UCSC anthropology department is establishing to honor the work of Gregory Bateson, the English anthropologist who taught at UCSC in the 1970s. "It will continue the intellectual tradition of creativity that Bateson pursued in his life," Tsing said.<br/>
<br/>
Tsing will spend next fall quarter at Aarhus University, then teach in winter and spring at UCSC. She will spend academic year 2014-2015 at Aarhus, Denmark's second oldest university. Founded as a public university in 1928, it is located about 120 miles west of Copenhagen and is now Denmark's largest university with 43,600 students after a merger with the Aarhus School of Engineering.<br/>
<br/>
Tsing spent six months at the university in 2010 while on a Guggenheim Fellowship.<br/>
<br/>
Social Sciences Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki congratulated Tsing on the professorship and said it "will provide great opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at UCSC and will bring many advantages to UCSC's interdisciplinary research in the social sciences.<br/>
<br/>
"It is a wonderful program that we're very much looking forward to," he said.<br/>
<br/>
Niels Bohr was a Danish physicist who won the Nobel Prize in 1922 for his contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum mechanics, He was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research. Tsing said Bohr was known for working with a diverse group of thinkers who created an atmosphere that resulted in unexpected discoveries.<br/>
<br/>
She said she hopes to continue the tradition of working across academic boundaries. "We need to revitalize conversation between the human and natural sciences," she said.&#160;&#160; &#8220;One way to do this is through developing common tools of observation.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
"Scholars still have a lot to learn about noticing," she said, "but for this we need the resources of all the disciplines."<br/>
<br/>
"If we want to address the massive environmental challenges of our times, we must do a better job of noticing who lives with us on human-disturbed landscapes, and under what conditions," she said.<br/>
<br/>
Tsing's previous research followed the wild mushroom called matsutake from forest to marketplace. The matsutake, a delicacy in Japan, grows in forests, such as in the Pacific Northwest, that have been disturbed by previous human activity.<br/>
<br/>
Tsing is an internationally renowned anthropologist and in 2011 was the recipient of the Martin M. Chemers Award for Outstanding Research in the Social Sciences Division. She joined UCSC in 1987.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3e58d95b8072704668860b1d83e40ce1"><name>sutter-scholarship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Health sciences grad Aaron Surrey earns Sutter medical school scholarship</title><summary>Health sciences grad Aaron Surrey will receive the 7th annual Primary Care Physician Award.</summary><keywords>SMSC, Sutter Scholarship, Primary Care Physician Award, Health Sciences</keywords><start-date>1371110400000</start-date><display-name>Health sciences grad earns Sutter scholarship</display-name><path>/2013/06/sutter-scholarship</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/06/sutter-scholarship</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1371140577482</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1371141173310</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Academics</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Mark Riley, SMSC</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/aaron-surrey.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/aaron-surrey.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aaron-surrey.jpg</name><display-name>aaron-surrey.jpg</display-name><file-size>36290</file-size><width>175</width><height>183</height></image><image-alt>Aaron Surrey</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/aaron-surrey-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/aaron-surrey-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aaron-surrey-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>aaron-surrey-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23799</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Aaron Surrey</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Aaron Surrey</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Aaron Surrey, who graduated from UC Santa Cruz in June with a degree in health sciences, will receive the 7th annual Primary Care Physician Award from <a href="http://www.suttermatsurgcenter.org/">Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center</a> (SMSC) and the <a href="http://www.ccah-alliance.org">Central California Alliance for Health</a>.</p>
<p>"Aaron is the seventh UCSC health sciences senior that we have sponsored since the inception of this program," said Larry deGhetaldi, M.D., president of the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Santa Cruz and SMSC community board member. "This has been a wonderful collaboration with the Alliance and UCSC. We are very proud of each of the seven future primary care physicians."</p>
<p>Surrey found his passion for medicine while taking a course in medical Spanish at UCSC, which he described as the best decision he made for his academic career. With a father who is a reproductive endocrinologist and a mother who is a nurse, Surrey grew up around medicine. He will be attending George Washington School of Medicine in Washington, D.C., starting in August.</p>
<p>"This is a pivotal time for health care, not just in our local area, but throughout the country," Surrey said. "As part of an incoming generation of physicians, I feel it is my duty to make sure that health care continues to grow and thrive in a way that allows access for everyone, not just the select few."</p>
<p>While a student at UCSC, Surrey earned Scholar All-West Region honors for his efforts in soccer, served on the Student Athletic Advisory Council, and formed the UCSC Sports Medicine Club. He served as a volunteer with the Global Medical Brigade in Santa Rosa, Honduras, and as an intern with Dr. Thomas Deetz and Dr. Sunita Singh in the PAMF Santa Cruz Infectious Disease department.</p>
<p>The annual Primary Care Physician Award was established by SMSC and the Alliance in conjunction with the UCSC Foundation to help carry out their mission to provide high-quality primary care to Central Coast Medi-Cal patients. The award supports a graduating senior with a major in health sciences at UCSC who will be entering an accredited medical school soon after successfully completing his or her bachelor&#8217;s degree. The recipient's medical training must result in an M.D. or D.O. degree and the recipient must intend to return to the Central Coast to practice in the area of primary care. The funds are intended to help meet the student's requirements for fees and tuition.</p>
<p>"Aaron has a great background and is well-deserving of this scholarship," said Alan McKay, CEO of the Alliance. "We wish him luck with his medical education and look forward to seeing him return as a member of our health care community."</p>
<p>Candidates are recommended by UCSC's Department of Molecular Cell and Developmental Biology to a committee comprised of representatives from SMSC, the Alliance, and the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency. There is no implied obligation or requirement that the award recipient shall be on staff at any particular organization in the area, but they will be expected to serve Medi-Cal patients.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3e6d52fd8072704668860b1d02a4a9d1"><name>blumenthal-year end</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Wrapping up a great year and looking ahead</title><summary>Chancellor Blumenthal shares thoughts about the year that's ending--and looks ahead to the fall.</summary><keywords>Blumenthal, chancellor, message, year end, reflection, mission,</keywords><start-date>1371078000000</start-date><display-name>Blumenthal-Year-end</display-name><path>/2013/06/blumenthal-year end</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/06/blumenthal-year end</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1371141919428</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1371141989459</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Looking ahead to <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/06/commencement-speakers-2013.html">commencement</a> this weekend, I'm feeling very proud. <br/>
<br/>
We do many, many things well on this campus, including instilling in our students the habit of independent thought. The ability to think critically&#8212;to assess the evidence and arrive at one's own conclusions&#8212;is the hallmark of a liberal arts education. I think the world needs more of that, not less, and I take comfort in knowing that more than 4,600 Banana Slugs are heading out to make their mark on the world.<br/>
<br/>
This is the time of year when we take stock of our accomplishments and present awards to recognize achievement. I had the good fortune to meet one of our impressive students at our annual student achievement awards reception. Kristoffer Hell&#233;n transferred to UCSC from Cabrillo College and has made the most of the opportunities we offer, writing a senior thesis in history that won the top award for undergraduate research, the 2013 Steck Family Award. You can read his story <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/06/steck-profile-kristoffer-hellen.html">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of presenting teaching awards to seven outstanding faculty members. We celebrated another important campus value when we presented the 2013 Chancellor's Achievement Awards for Diversity to five individuals and one student organization. Just this morning, I had breakfast with participants of the Chancellor's Undergraduate Internship Program, who have made great contributions to the campus.<br/>
<br/>
Already, of course, the wheels are in motion to continue the process: We received a record number of applications and have admitted a talented class for the fall.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I've spent much of the past nine months on the road, meeting with alumni, parents, and friends of the campus to shore up support for our mission. I've chronicled much of what I've been up to on my <a href="http://chancellor.ucsc.edu/blog/index.html">blog</a>. Rest assured, support for UC Santa Cruz has never been stronger. And with good reason: Faculty are doing path-breaking research, students are more engaged than ever, and our partnerships with external collaborators are strong.<br/>
<br/>
A year ago this spring, UCSC was ranked one of the best universities in the world under the age of 50. My goal is to be one of the best in the world, period. Great universities don't just happen; they are the product of people who care. Between now and our 50th anniversary in 2015, you'll see us rolling up our sleeves to ensure that we have the resources, vision, and focus to reach our full potential. There will be plenty of opportunities to get involved.<br/>
<br/>
For now, let's enjoy the achievement of this year's graduates. We all contribute to their success. And to those of you who are about to join the illustrious ranks of UCSC alumni, I hope you'll keep in touch. I'm always available at chancellor@ucsc.edu. Congratulations to the Class of 2013!<br/>

Researchers at UC Santa Cruz assembled the first working draft of the human genome sequence in 2000, just days before a private biotechnology company completed its first assembly. Since the public consortium finished the genome ahead of the private company, the genome and the information it contains are available free to researchers worldwide. UCSC researchers have worked since then to keep the genome a public good. Following is the original press release from July 6, 2000, announcing the breakthrough.</p>
<p>For Immediate Release</p>
<p>July 6, 2000, Santa Cruz, Ca--Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who performed the computer analysis to assemble a working draft of the human genome sequence have now posted their results on a UCSC web site <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">(http://genome.ucsc.edu).</a> Biomedical researchers throughout the world can now search the working draft for particular genes or DNA sequences of interest to them.</p>
<p>A group led by David Haussler, professor of computer science and director of UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, created a powerful new computer program to assemble the working draft from the sequence data obtained by the International Human Genome Project. The policy of the public consortium of scientists working on the Human Genome Project has been to release sequence information to the world as soon as possible. Until the working draft was assembled, however, the sequence data were only available in many small pieces.</p>
<p>"This is the first publicly available view of the human genome sequence tentatively placed in the order and orientation in which we think it occurs along the human chromosomes," Haussler said.</p>
<p>Haussler noted that after a 10-year effort involving many laboratories and more than 1,000 scientists, the human genome can now be downloaded from the UCSC web site in about an hour and a half by anyone with a DSL-speed Internet connection. The genome sequence is essentially a long string of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs, representing the chemical units of DNA, called bases.</p>
<p>The human genome consists of approximately 3.1 billion bases arrayed along the length of the chromosomes.</p>
<p>Scientists involved in the Human Genome Project have sequenced about 85 percent of the human genome and continue to generate new sequence data at a rapid pace. Haussler's group will rerun their computer analysis every few weeks, incorporating new data so that biomedical researchers will have immediate access to the most up-to-date assembly.</p>
<p>Although the current working draft still has some gaps and uncertainty in it, it is already extremely useful for most biomedical research purposes, said Alan Zahler, an associate professor of biology at UCSC. In many cases, researchers have identified part of a gene or have other clues to the gene's sequence. They can now use that information to search the genome for the rest of the sequence associated with the gene they are interested in.</p>
<p>In addition, researchers who know the sequence of one gene can search the genome for similar sequences to find related genes. Many genes are members of multigene families with similar and sometimes overlapping functions, Zahler said.</p>
<p>"Identification of all of the members of a gene family will give us a sense for how many genes with a certain role are present in the genome," Zahler said. "Before, it took long periods of experimentation to find out whether a gene in humans was a member of a larger family of genes."</p>
<p>As a test for completeness of the working draft, Human Genome Project scientists searched the draft for known genes associated with human genetic diseases and found 95 percent of those diseases had identifiable genes in the working draft.</p>
<p>"The chances of finding a particular disease gene in the working draft are apparently quite good," Haussler said. "Technically, the working draft only covers about 85 percent of the genome, but in practice it appears to cover 95 percent of the disease genes."</p>
<p>The working draft is also an exciting beginning for scientists interested in understanding gene structure and organization in humans, Zahler noted.</p>
<p>"For the first time, we will be able to look at tens of thousands of genes at once and start to search for common themes in areas such as how classes of genes are turned on and off, how the information in genes is processed into a form that encodes proteins, and how that processing is regulated," he said.</p>
<p>Jim Kent, a graduate student working with Zahler, designed and wrote most of the software used to assemble the working draft, which was compiled from hundreds of thousands of fragments of various sizes.</p>
<p>"Imagine you had five copies of 'War and Peace' and one of 'Crime and Punishment,' you put them through a paper shredder, and then try to paste together a single copy of 'War and Peace' from the shreds," Kent said. "That job would be a lot like assembling the human genome, except that the genome runs to about a million pages."</p>
<p>Haussler said Kent's accomplishments will have a very real impact on science and medicine. "He has shown enormous talent and creativity in tackling this fundamental problem," Haussler said.</p>
<p>In addition to the UCSC web site, the working draft will also be available on sites maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</a>) and the European Bioinformatics Institute (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/</a>). Both NCBI and EBI are major contributors to the computational analysis of the human genome data. Haussler has already sent them the current working draft and will continue to send them updated versions as new sequence data are incorporated into the analysis.</p>

<br/>
<em>Songs of Our Own: The Art of the Grateful Dead Phenomenon</em> features more than 158 primary works, plus 110 digital images, with signature pieces by band members Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart, and Bill Kreutzmann, as well as works from numerous Deadhead artists.<br/>
<br/>
The exhibition is curated by UCSC&#8217;s Grateful Dead Archivist Nicholas Meriwether.<br/>
<br/>
Documenting the extraordinary art that celebrates the band, the works range from Garcia&#8217;s student days at the California School of Fine Arts, to the poster renaissance of Haight-Asbury in the 1960s, to the increasingly sophisticated art created by both fans and band members over the past four decades.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;In 2003, lyricist Robert Hunter wrote that &#8216;I&#8217;ve come to realize that the art movement that accompanied the rise of the Dead is as much a part of what we became in the public eye as the songs and our playing of them,&#8217;&#8221; said Meriwether. &#8220;This exhibit shows how that remarkable art informs the Grateful Dead phenomenon and helps define its significance.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The art they produced is a window into American culture&#8212;an extraordinary body of work that challenges how we understand the protean fusion of high art and folk art that has become one of America&#8217;s greatest gifts to the world,&#8221; Meriwether added.&#160;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Works on display include an unpublished J<strong>erry Garcia</strong> monoprint that has never before been publically exhibited; a mixed media piece by <strong>Mickey Hart</strong> titled <em>Where Angels Fear to Tread</em>; a lithograph titled <em>The Summer of Love</em> by <strong>Wavy Gravy</strong> (contributed by Meriwether); <strong>Stanley Mouse&#8217;s</strong> <em>Phil Lesh Workingman&#8217;s Dead Portrait</em>; <strong>Bill Kreutzmann&#8217;s</strong> <em>Egg of Life</em>, giclee on canvas; <strong>Wes Wilson&#8217;s</strong> lithograph <em>Bill Graham 51</em>; and and four pen-and-ink cartoons by band lyricist <strong>Robert Hunter</strong>."<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/05/brittingham-dead-central.html">Brittingham Family Foundation Dead Central</a> exhibition space is located on the main floor of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s McHenry Library, just inside the front door.<br/>

<br/>
David Haussler, distinguished professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science &amp; Engineering, said that if companies were allowed to patent naturally occurring genetic variations, it would greatly inhibit scientific and medical progress.<br/>
<br/>
"The Supreme Court made the right distinction between naturally occurring molecules and synthetic molecules that are engineered by people," he said. "Understanding genetic variation in humans is fundamental to scientific and medical investigations of cancer and other diseases. People can use that information to create a new therapy or drug, and in that case, when you create a novel molecular combination, that's a creative act, and you should be able to patent that. But the common genetic inheritance of the human species is not patentable."<br/>
<br/>
The Supreme Court case involved patents on two genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, used in genetic testing for cancer risk. Certain mutations in these genes greatly increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Due to the patents, however, options for testing were limited and expensive.<br/>
<br/>
"This is an important win for the biosciences and industry," said Jenny Reardon, co-director of UCSC's Science and Justice Research Center. "Undoubtedly the decision will make the BRCA genetic testing more affordable and thus accessible to more women.&#160; However, the ruling is also a win for many genetic testing services that seek to provide testing across the genome."<br/>
<br/>
Reardon is an associate professor of sociology and faculty affiliate in the Center for Biomolecular Science &amp; Engineering where she studies science and society.<br/>
<br/>
When Haussler's group began its work on the Human Genome Project in 1999, the potential privatization of the human genome was a very real concern. The public consortium that Haussler had just joined was in a race with a private company, Celera Genomics, to determine the complete DNA sequence of the human genome. Haussler's team assembled the first working draft of the human genome sequence in June 2000, just days before Celera completed its first assembly, and published it shortly thereafter on a UCSC web site.<br/>
<br/>
"Companies were already trying to lock up gene patents, and we felt that would be detrimental to science," Haussler said. "The public consortium's strategy was to get the information out and make it public before it was patented, and we accomplished that in July 2000 when we released the first draft of the human genome from Santa Cruz without any patent claims, free to the world."<br/>
<br/>
Reardon said that "as tremendous advances in sequencing technologies have made whole genome sequencing possible and feasible, and it has become clear that to address most disease looking across the genome, and not at single genes, is key, gene patents hinder many in the industry."<br/>
<br/>
While the court's ruling addressed one of the property issues raised by genomics, Reardon said,&#160; "in some ways it was the easiest one. What lies ahead will be much less clear and more complicated decisions about who can own and control genomic data."<br/>
<br/>
Reardon is at work on her second book, <em>The Post-Genomic Condition: Ethics, Justice, Knowledge After the Genome</em>.<br/>

A new effort, funded by the National Cancer Institute and led by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, aims to clear several key roadblocks that have stymied progress in this field.</p>
<p>The $3.5 million project will use the latest in "big data" technology to bridge the gap between the petabytes of raw genomic data in centralized repositories like UCSC's <a href="https://cghub.ucsc.edu/">Cancer Genomics Hub</a> (CGHub) and the higher levels of interpretive information that can lead to clinically useful predictions, such as which drugs are most effective against tumors with certain mutations. Project leader Joshua Stuart, an associate professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, compares the raw genomic data to the binary code running on a computer.</p>
<p>"Your web browser doesn't understand zeros and ones. There are layers and layers of software programs between that and what you see on a web page. We need to do the same thing for DNA sequences to reach the higher levels of interpretation needed for scientific discovery," Stuart said.</p>
<p>Stuart's group will build a separate database, called the Biomedical Evidence Graph (BMEG), for storing and analyzing interpretive information derived from the raw sequence data stored in the CGHub. Like Facebook's social graph, the BMEG will use a graph database structure designed for lightning-fast access to complex, interconnected datasets.</p>
<p>"Our analyses can reveal connections between different tumor samples based on their molecular profiles, and the natural way to represent that in a database is with the graph structures used for Facebook and other social networks," Stuart said.</p>
<p>A UCSC team led by bioinformatics expert and BMEG co-investigator David Haussler established CGHub in 2012 to manage data from the <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)</a> consortium and other NIH cancer genomics research programs. Because CGHub holds genome sequences from thousands of individual patients, access is strictly controlled and limited to researchers approved by NIH. But the BMEG will hold higher-level data derived from analyses of the raw genome sequences and will not require the same level of security restrictions.</p>
<p>"The idea is to build a shared knowledge base and create a playground where lots of researchers can interact, test their algorithms, and compare results," Stuart said. "TCGA researchers have built a lot of great tools for data analysis, and we need to get those installed in the BMEG so the rest of the world can engage in that higher level analysis. We want to establish the tools and data analysis pipelines that will be useful for current and future collections of data."</p>
<p>The BMEG complements a parallel project, called Medbook, which will link together patients, biopsy samples, doctors, and researchers into a social network framework. Stuart and recent Ph.D. graduate Ted Goldstein created Medbook for their work on a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/10/prostate-cancer.html">prostate cancer project funded by Stand Up To Cancer</a> (SU2C). "The BMEG will provide patient-level genome information to Medbook, creating a powerful partnership between the two efforts," Stuart said.</p>
<p>The BMEG will enable outside researchers to securely analyze CGHub-related data without needing to transmit vast amounts of data over the internet. Currently, TCGA data analysis centers download huge files of raw data from CGHub for analysis on their own computers. BMEG will be co-located with the CGHub servers at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, and researchers will be able to run their analyses as apps on the BMEG platform.</p>
<p>Cancer genomics researchers involved in TCGA and related projects are still working to develop and refine the analytical tools needed to extract predictive evidence from their rapidly growing databases. This includes the very first layer of analysis, the identification of mutations in a patient's tumor genome. Different research groups use different algorithms for this, and CGHub scientists found that these algorithms give inconsistent answers.</p>
<p>"That was a big shocker to me when the TCGA and International Cancer Genome consortiums started comparing the algorithms used by different institutions," Stuart said. "You'd think we'd know which one to install, but there are more than a dozen of them and they all came up with different answers. Only in the last year have we sorted that out, and David Haussler has created a unified effort to identify mutations for TCGA."</p>
<p>The mutation data, together with information on gene locations, then feeds into higher-level analyses. Stuart's lab, for example, uses this information to identify the genetic pathways affected by a patient's mutations. Using knowledge about how genes work in groups by signaling and regulating each other, he is able to find connections between different mutations that affect the same pathways. In previous work on TCGA data, results from Stuart's pathway analysis proved to be better predictors of overall survival in glioblastoma patients than a lower level of genomic analysis, and pathway signatures also revealed novel connections between mutations and drug response in breast cancers.&#160;</p>
<p>As with the mutation-finding algorithms, higher-level analyses are likely to differ among research groups. To find out who has the best algorithm for any particular type of analysis, they have to be compared side by side in blinded competitions. For the BMEG project, Stuart has teamed up with Adam Margolin of <a href="http://sagebase.org/">Sage Bionetworks</a>, a nonprofit bioinformatics company, to run a series of such competitions.</p>
<p>"We've done this before, and it will be fun. We'll run competitions and then hold a conference at the end to go over the results," Stuart said. "To participate, people will give us their code and we'll run it on a test dataset. That's how we'll build out this enterprise, starting with the first level of data analysis and building up to predictive algorithms for things like patient survival and response to drug treatments."</p>
<p>By establishing a robust pipeline for analysis of cancer genomics data, the BMEG will help researchers discover clinically useful molecular signatures. In addition to their work with TCGA, Stuart and Haussler are involved in several other collaborative cancer genomics projects that will feed into the BMEG. These include the <a href="http://www.lincsproject.org/">Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures</a> (LINCS), the <a href="http://www.standup2cancer.org/su2c_cancer_research_teams">Stand Up To Cancer</a> (SU2C) dream teams, and the <a href="http://www.ispy2trial.org/about/background-i-spy-1-trial">I-SPY</a> breast cancer trial. These projects provide a wealth of curated genomic and clinical data that can be used for developing and assessing cancer genomics tools.</p>
<p>The lead architect on the BMEG project at UCSC is Kyle Ellrott, a software developer who worked closely with Stuart and Goldstein to craft the original proposal. Ellrott has been leading the coordination of datasets and results for TCGA's new "Pan-Cancer" project to compare many different forms of cancer. He has broad experience in applying cutting-edge computational tools to cancer genome analysis.</p>

<p>The study, led by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em>, is the first to show that corals are not able to fully acclimate to low pH conditions in nature.</p>
<p>"People have seen similar effects in laboratory experiments," said coauthor Adina Paytan, a research scientist in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz. "We looked in places where the corals are exposed to low pH for their entire life span. The good news is that they don't just die. They are able to grow and calcify, but they are not producing robust structures."</p>
<p>With atmospheric carbon dioxide rising steadily, the oceans are absorbing more carbon dioxide, which lowers the pH of the surface waters. Ocean acidification refers to changes in seawater chemistry that move it closer to the acidic range of the pH scale, although seawater is not expected to become literally acidic. Paytan's team studied coral reefs along the Caribbean coastline of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula where submarine springs lower the pH of the surrounding seawater in a localized, natural setting. The effect is similar to the widespread ocean acidification that is occurring as the oceans absorb increasing amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Led by first author Elizabeth Crook, a graduate student in Paytan's lab, the researchers deployed instruments to monitor seawater chemistry around the springs and removed skeletal cores from colonies of <em>Porites astreoides,</em> an important Caribbean reef-building coral. They performed CT scans of the core samples to measure their densities and determine annual calcification rates in the laboratory of coauthor Anne Cohen at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</p>
<p>The results showed that coral calcification rates decrease significantly along a natural gradient in seawater pH. Ocean acidification lowers the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater, making it more difficult for corals to build their calcium carbonate skeletons.</p>
<p>"Carbonate ions are the building blocks they need to grow their skeletons. When the pH is lower the corals have to use more energy to accumulate these carbonate building blocks internally. As a result, the calcification rate is lower and they lay down less dense skeletons," Paytan said.</p>
<p>The reduced density of the coral skeletons makes them more vulnerable to mechanical erosion during storms, organisms that bore into corals, and parrotfish, which sometimes feed on corals. This could lead to a weakening of the reef framework and subsequent degradation of the complex coral reef ecosystem.</p>
<p>"There are likely to be major shifts in reef species and some loss of coral cover, but if ocean acidification is the only impact there won't be total destruction," Paytan said. "We need to protect corals from other stressors, such as pollution and overfishing. If we can control those, the impact of ocean acidification might not be as bad."</p>
<p>In addition to Crook, Cohen, and Paytan, the coauthors of the paper include Mario Rebolledo-Vieyra and Laura Hernandez of the Centro de Investigacion Cientifica de Yucatan. This research was funded by the National Science Foundation and UC-MEXUS.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

inspiring at <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/06/commencement-speakers-2013.html">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 2013 commencement celebrations</a>, which attracted throngs of well-wishers and myriad speakers. More than 4,600 students received degrees across the weekend.</p>
<p>The sun was out, and celebrants &#8211; and even some of the graduating students &#8211; wore fresh-flower leis. Audience members waved hand-made signs and displayed messages printed on oversized helium baloons. On Friday afternoon, during the commencement celebration for graduate students, one young woman, carrying her infant son, cheered so loudly for her graduating sister that the baby woke up and started crying.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s OK, sweetie,&#8221; she said to the startled, sobbing baby. &#8220;We were only shouting because we were <em>happy</em>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Commencement ceremonies honored 4,195 candidates for bachelor degrees for work completed in the arts, engineering, humanities, physical and biological sciences, and social sciences. Spring candidates for bachelor degrees total 2,579, according to the UC Santa Cruz registrar's office. Another 1,616 completed coursework in the summer, fall, or winter quarters.</p>
<p>UCSC's Class of 2013 is filled with students who are ready to make a difference in the world &#8212; and, in many cases, already have. Consider the stories of these four graduates:&#8232;&#8226;&#160;<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/06/emerson-glassey.html">Emerson Glassey</a>&#8232;&#8226;&#160;<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/04/rev-spring-13-uncommon-ledesma.html">Juan Ledesma</a>&#8232;&#8226;&#160;<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/06/elizabeth-devitt.html">Elizabeth Devitt</a>&#8232;&#8226;&#160;<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/06/carson-watts.html">Carson Watts</a></p>
<p>There were many inspirational moments across the weekend. Among them: watching high-performing astronomy graduate students getting &#8220;hooded&#8221; by the likes of University Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics Sandra Faber, listening to the inspirational remarks of U.S. Rep. Donna Edwards at the College Eight commencement, and watching a new generation of Slug alumni throw their caps high in the air.</p>
<p>During her keynote address at Oakes College on Saturday, Audries Blake, daughter of founding Oakes College provost Herman Blake, told graduates to dream big and never give up. As one of her illustrations, she talked about &#8220;short&#8221; basketball players who had to work extra hard to win the confidence of their &#8220;height-dominant&#8221; teammates.</p>
<p>She also referred to the story of her father and his dream of a UCSC college that would welcome and encourage &#8220;underrepresented students &#8230; typically not seen within academia or the UC system.&#8221;</p>
<p class="Default">&#8220;If you were to look into his background,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;there would be no way it would seem possible that he could do what has been done. Born before the civil rights movement began, he was poor, black, from a single-parent home with few options for the future.&#8221;</p>
<p class="Default">But Herman Blake was ambitious. &#8220;He loved to read, and had a voracious appetite for all things," said Audries Blake, development assistant at UCSC's Division of Social Sciences. "Freedom was within education, and what my father received, he was determined to bring &#8230;&#160; to any person of color, any person from within impoverished communities, any person marginalized by society&#8217;s expectations or demeaning categorizations. Freedom was within education. He was here for a purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p class="Default">Kresge College graduates gave a standing ovation to commencement speaker Megan Kostecka, a graduating Kresge senior who found a compassionate, healing community at UCSC after a horrific experience on the East Coast. &#160;</p>
<p class="Default">After being beaten viciously by a mugger while enrolled in Boston University, she returned to her home in California. Kostecka decided to go back to college "and learn how to be a functioning 18-year-old again." She applied to all nine UC campuses for admission. UC Santa Cruz not only told her 'yes.' She even received a personal voice mail from the university: "we are rooting for you."&#160;</p>
<p class="Default">"You may not have known it," Kostecka told the crowd, "but your compassion and kindness brought me back to life. Looking into the crowd I see a multiplicity of races, genders, personalities, and majors, yet I know we share one common virtue: compassion ... I do not know the causal relationship between compassion and UCSC. I don&#8217;t know if simply belonging to this community makes you a more caring individual or if we recruit students who excel in active empathy. &#160;Whatever the origin, I am certain that it is this capacity to identify with and value other human beings that truly makes us one of kind."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="541d751c8072704668860b1d904483f6"><name>shakespeare-opens</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Shakespeare Santa Cruz opens July 23 with 'Taming of the Shrew'</title><summary>Shakespeare Santa Cruz will open with the popular comedy, 'The Taming of the Shrew,' and continue through Sept. 1 with 'Henry V' and 'Tom Jones.'

Edward Morgan will make his SSC directing debut with this production.<br/>
<br/>
Morgan previously worked at Utah Shakespeare Festival, The Shakespeare Theatre, The Kennedy Center, and Milwaukee Rep, and is also a casting partner with Cirque du Solei.<br/>
<br/>
Playing in repertory in the Festival Glen will be the final play in SSC&#8217;s making-of-a-king trilogy, <strong><em>Henry V</em>,</strong> directed by Paul Mullins.<br/>
<br/>
Mullins is an associate artist at The Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey, and has also directed for The Old Globe, The Dorset Theatre Festival, The Studio Theatre in Washington, D.C., and American Stage.</p>
<p>The summer season will also feature the annual Fringe show, which has been a favorite of SSC audiences. Each year, SSC&#8217;s multi-talented acting and production interns get a chance to show their stuff, in the words of artistic director Marco Barricelli: &#8220;unencumbered by those pesky professional actors.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The 2013 Fringe show will be <em><strong>Tom Jones</strong></em>, adapted by Jon Jory from the classic Henry Fielding novel. A bawdy and rollicking comedy, the play will be directed by SSC alumna and UCSC Theater Arts faculty member, Patty Gallagher. It plays in the Glen for two performances only, August 20 and 27.</p>
<p>For the first time in SSC history, all shows will take place outdoors among the redwoods in the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen.</p>

The role of anthropology in the study of climate change has long been overlooked, they write.<br/>
<br/>
Andrew Mathews, associate professor of anthropology, and Jessica O'Reilly, writing in the online journal <em>Nature Climate Change</em>, note that the mammoth challenges posed by climate change require the collaboration of experts from both the natural and social sciences. O'Reilly received her Ph.D. from UCSC in 2008 and now is a research associate at Princeton University and teaches at the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University in Minnesota.<br/>
<br/>
Such cross-disciplinary approaches to research are a hallmark of UC Santa Cruz since it was founded 48 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
"We suggest that anthropologists are particularly well placed to contribute to understanding and responding to these challenges," Mathews and O'Reilly write along with their eight co-authors. The article, "<a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v3/n6/full/nclimate1775.html">Contribution of anthropology to the study of climate change</a>," stems from a workshop led by Michael Dove and Jessica Barnes of Yale University, which a year ago brought together a group of anthropologists who work on issues related to climate change.&#160;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
The authors identify three ways that anthropological research can aid, enrich, and deepen contemporary understandings of climate change.<br/>
<br/>
First, the discipline's tradition of in-depth fieldwork gives anthropologists insight into the cultural values and political relations that shape the creation of climate-related knowledge.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Second, "is an awareness of the historical context underpinning contemporary climate debates." Anthropological expertise gained from the study of development projects such as dam and road building can contribute to contemporary climate change mitigation projects, which may otherwise have unforeseen negative consequences for local populations.<br/>
<br/>
And third is anthropology's "broad, holistic view of human and natural systems, which highlights the multiple cultural, social, political, and economic changes that take place in our societies."<br/>
<br/>
Mathews, who is director of the Science and Justice Working Group at UCSC, said that anthropological contributions can complement research from other disciplines and further global dialogue on science and policy questions. Anthropologists can look at how humans approach studies of climate change and "bring insights into how science is produced in particular social, political, economic and cultural contexts."</p>
<p>As an example, the authors cite studies of the workings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an organization that is key to interpreting scientific knowledge of climate change for the international community. What factors might lead a small group of scientists to question climate change? Financial interests and conservative values may play a role, but what about culture, they ask.<br/>

They were featured at an Entrepreneurship Showcase event held June 8 at the UCSC Silicon Valley Center, where business leaders, investors, and venture capitalists mingled with faculty, students, and alumni of the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Jack Baskin School of Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>"From my point of view it was a resounding success," said Shaanan, lecturer and academic coordinator of the engineering school's Technology and Information Management (TIM) program. "The students did a great job and the feedback was extremely positive. I plan to continue mentoring several of the teams."</p>
<p>Atiq Raza, chairman and CEO of CALIENT Technologies and former president and COO of AMD, gave a keynote talk on entrepreneurship, drawing on his distinguished career in Silicon Valley industry. Michael Riepe, who was instrumental in organizing the event as chair of the Baskin Alumni Advisory Council, said it brought together a diverse mix of people and activities related to entrepreneurship and UCSC's engineering programs.</p>
<p>"We wanted to show the Silicon Valley start-up ecosystem what UCSC is doing in entrepreneurship and engineering," Riepe said. "In addition to the student presentations, the event showcased the infrastructure we now have in Silicon Valley and the opportunities for collaboration with the Baskin School of Engineering."</p>
<p>The day began with a "Start-up Challenge," in which <a href="https://entrep.soe.ucsc.edu/2013-projects-list">ten student teams</a> presented their business plans to a panel of judges. The judges selected three projects to feature in the Entrepreneurship Showcase event in the afternoon: <a href="http://www.aganki.com/">Aganki</a>, an online academic and social platform; <a href="http://www.pydroponics.com/">PyDroponics</a>, a self-controlled hydroponics system for home use; and <a href="http://swopp.it/">Swoppit</a>, a website where people can swap items through single or multiple trades. Each of these three teams received $3,000 in seed money, and the judges also awarded seed money to three additional teams. A generous individual donor gave most of the money to fund these seed grants.</p>
<p>"We will build on this model and expand it as we move forward," Shaanan said. "It will be a great way for alumni and businesses to directly impact entrepreneurship at UCSC."</p>
<p>Japneet Kaur, a business management economics major who just finished her junior year at UCSC, leads the Aganki team. The Aganki product aims to securely integrate students' academic and social lives into one platform that promotes efficiency and transparency in their daily school activities. Kaur and team members Biney Kaur Dev and Sargunjot Kaur plan to include a variety of features in their cloud-based productivity suite for students and instructors, including a "smart" calendar, automated grade book, open discussion forums, private messaging, and student profiles. It's all designed to provide useful tools for both students and instructors and to improve their online interactions.</p>
<p>"As students, we see the need for this in our daily lives," Japneet Kaur said. "Each professor uses a different online platform for their courses. It would be a big improvement to have all our classes on a common platform, and it could allow for more open collaboration between students and instructors."</p>
<p>The Entrepreneurship Showcase was a great opportunity to network and make connections, she said. "We got a lot of really good advice from people, including one of the judges. The fact that they took us seriously enough to offer suggestions was pretty cool."</p>
<p>This was the first academic year for the <a href="https://entrep.soe.ucsc.edu/">Entrepreneurship Studies Initiative</a> established by Shaanan, who has developed courses and other activities in entrepreneurship for the initiative. The students participating in it come from a wide range of disciplines, including economics and engineering, he said.</p>
<p>"We have a very good, solid crop of student projects this year, and I think we have a fantastic model. I'm already developing the outline for next year," Shaanan said.</p>
<p>The Entrepreneurship Showcase event was sponsored by the Baskin Alumni Advisory Council, the UCSC Entrepreneurship and Business Group, the <a href="http://tim.soe.ucsc.edu/">Technology and Information Management</a> program, and the UC Santa Cruz Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/11/kapany-chair.html</url><title>Gift from Narinder Kapany establishes endowed chair in entrepreneurship</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5e5859038072704668860b1d5deed905"><name>ucrp-rate-increase</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCRP Contribution Rate Increase</title><summary>We write to remind you that, as previously announced, contribution rates to the UC Retirement Plan (UCRP) for both the university and employees will increase next month. </summary><start-date>1371628800000</start-date><display-name>UCRP Contribution Rate Increase</display-name><path>/2013/06/ucrp-rate-increase</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/06/ucrp-rate-increase</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1371677415625</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1371677415625</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>We write to remind you that, as previously announced, contribution rates to the UC Retirement Plan (UCRP) for both the university and employees will increase next month.</span></p>
<p><span>Starting July 1, t<span>he university will pay 12 percent of pay, up from 10 percent</span>, and contribution<span>s for academic and staff employees will rise to 6.5 percent of pay, up from 5 percent (contributions for union-represented employees are subject to collective bargaining where applicable).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As you know, the Board of Regents in 2010 adopted a series of measures as part of a carefully-constructed, multi-pronged strategy to ensure the long-term viability of UCRP benefits and also to help reduce the $24 billion unfunded liability to UC&#8217;s retirement programs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Even with these changes, UC&#8217;s retirement benefits remain very attractive.&#160; In fact, very few public and private employers across the country offer a traditional pension and retiree health benefits. At UC, we know these are valued benefits for our faculty and staff, and we are working diligently to sustain them.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You will see the increased contributions reflected in your regular paychecks for July earnings, paid between July 17 and August 1, 2013 depending on your payroll cycle. Employee contributions are pre-tax.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Re:&#160; A<span class="dhighlight">umento</span> de tasa de contribuci&#243;n UCRP</span></span></p>
<p><span>Escribimos para recordar que, tal como se anunci&#243; previamente, las tasas de contribuci&#243;n al Plan de Retiro de la UC (UCRP, por sus siglas en ingl&#233;s) aumentar&#225;n el mes pr&#243;ximo, tanto para la universidad como para los empleados.</span></p>
<p><span>A partir del 1 de julio la universidad pagar&#225; el 12 por ciento de la paga, un aumento sobre el 10 por ciento actual, y las contribuciones de la facultad y del personal aumentar&#225;n al 6,5 por ciento de la paga, un aumento sobre el 5 por ciento actual (en los casos aplicables, las contribuciones de los empleados representados por sindicatos quedar&#225;n sujetas a negociaciones colectivas).</span></p>
<p><span>Como ya ustedes saben, la Junta de Regentes aprob&#243; un serie de medidas en el 2010 como parte de una estrategia m&#250;ltiple, cuidadosamente elaborada para asegurar la viabilidad a largo plazo de los beneficios del UCRP, as&#237; como para ayudar a reducir la obligaci&#243;n carente de fondos, por valor de $24.000 millones, que pesa sobre los programas de retiro de la UC.</span></p>
<p><span><span>A&#250;n con estos cambios, los beneficios de retiro de la UC siguen siendo muy atractivos. De hecho, muy pocos empleadores p&#250;blicos o privados por todo el pa&#237;s ofrecen una pensi&#243;n tradicional y beneficios de salud para retirados. En la UC, nosotros sabemos cu&#225;n valiosos son estos beneficios para nuestra facultad y nuestro personal, y estamos trabajando diligentemente para mantenerlos.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ustedes ver&#225;n los aumentos a las contribuciones reflejados en sus cheques regulares del mes de julio, pagaderos entre el 17 de julio y el 1 de agosto de 2013, seg&#250;n el ciclo de su n&#243;mina. Las contribuciones del empleado son pre impuestos.</span></span></p>

A Field Day site will be set up on the edge of the Lower East Field on the UCSC campus.</p>
<p>The general public is invited to visit the site on Saturday, June 22, from dawn to dusk, with radio operation beginning at approximately 11 a.m.</p>
<p>This is the 11th year that UCSC has hosted Field Day exercises. The UCSC Amateur Radio Club (ARC), informally known as the "Ham Slugs" since 2002, is soon to be formally recognized as a club compliant with the guidelines of the Amateur Radio Relay League (ARRL) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The club received a small grant from the ARRL this year to help establish a ground station for use in amateur radio satellite communications. &#160;</p>
<p>"The challenge of communicating with satellite stations is immensely intriguing for an engineer, and designing a ground station that is capable of being used by students to communicate with a satellite is even more enthralling," said engineering student Jason Ragland, current president of the UCSC ARC and president of the UCSC chapter of the Engineering Honor Society, Tau Beta Pi.</p>
<p>The ground station is an FCC compliant amateur radio station designed to communicate with other amateur radio stations via satellite. The UCSC team designed their own software to calculate the orbits of amateur radio satellite stations, track their locations, and control the ground station's antennas to point in the correct direction. The team is hoping to erect an antenna in a location where it will continue to be available for further student experimentation, Ragland said.</p>
<p>Students will participate in this year's Field Day exercise along with FCC-licensed faculty, staff, and outside advisors. Thousands of amateur radio operators around the country will be demonstrating their emergency communications capabilities during this national event. Ham radio operators provide essential communications during wildfires, earthquakes and other emergencies. During Field Day, amateur radio operators set up and establish field communications capabilities as an exercise to prepare for times of natural disasters and emergencies.</p>

Eesha Khare, a student at Lynbrook High School in San Jose, won the prize for her work on an energy storage device carried out under the mentorship of Yat Li, an assistant professor of chemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Her project was to develop nanostructured electrodes for supercapacitors, a type of energy storage device," Li said. "Eesha's research was an extension of work we are doing in my lab, but she came up with her own ideas and took it in a new direction. It was a well-planned and well-managed project, so I was very impressed."</p>
<p>Li has been mentoring high school students in his lab since 2010 through the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/07/3954.html">UCSC Science Internship Program</a> launched by astronomy professor Puragra Guhathakurta. In 2011, an intern in Li's lab was one of two high school students mentored at UCSC who were <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/02/intel-finalists.html">finalists</a> in the nationwide Intel Science Talent Search competition.</p>
<p>Li said he has been impressed by all of the high school students who have worked in his lab. "They are very motivated and eager to learn," he said. "Each year we see more students applying to the program, and they are coming from a more diversified group of high schools."</p>
<p>In 2012, Li knew he would be traveling a lot during the summer, so he decided not to participate in the internship program. But Khare had approached him early in the year and really wanted to work in his lab, so Li agreed to take her on informally and assigned one of his graduate students, Xihong Lu, to oversee her work.</p>
<p>"I gave her several papers on two different areas of research in my lab and asked her to come up with an idea for a project," Li said.</p>
<p>Khare was interested in Li's research on novel nanomaterials for energy conversion and energy storage. She designed experiments based on the literature she read, and brainstormed ideas with Li and Lu. During her ten-week internship, she fabricated and tested a supercapacitor device, demonstrating that it can power LEDs and a timer.</p>
<p>A supercapacitor holds much more energy than an ordinary capacitor, but less than a battery (the "energy density" of a battery is about 10 times that of a supercapacitor). The advantages of supercapacitors include the ability to charge and discharge extremely rapidly, and they don't degrade over time or over hundreds of thousands of cycles of charging and discharging. Rechargable batteries, in contrast, have a limited number of cycles and can't deliver a large amount of power quickly.</p>
<p>Khare said she was motivated to work on the supercapacitor because she was frustrated by how often her cell phone's battery dies and how long it takes to recharge it. Her supercapacitor is small and flexible, and it can charge up in about 20 to 30 seconds. Unfortunately, this led to a lot of news stories suggesting that her project would enable people to charge their cell phones in 20 seconds.</p>
<p>"I think it started from a misunderstanding," Li said. "Charging can be done very quickly with a supercapacitor, but it doesn't store nearly as much energy as a lithium ion battery, so it would not be practical for powering a cell phone."</p>
<p>Supercapacitors do have a wide range of applications, however, especially in situations where the ability to store or deliver a lot of energy quickly is more important than the energy storage capacity. In Shanghai, China, some city buses are powered by supercapacitors, charging up at each bus stop. Supercapacitors are often combined with rechargable batteries to provide, for example, backup or emergency power, and there may well be potential applications for supercapacitors in future cell phones. But don't expect to be charging your cell phone in 20 seconds any time soon, Li said.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_23445865/saratoga-teen-wins-intel-award-longer-lasting-cell</url><title>San Jose Mercury News article</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ug1BBMtVYgI#at=121</url><title>Video: Intel Awards Winner 2013 - Eesha Khare</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="677e9d898072704668860b1db6859bfd"><name>haussler-white-house</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC scientist attends White House ceremony honoring open science</title><summary>David Haussler attended a White House event highlighting Open Science "Champions of Change."</summary><keywords>David Haussler, genomics, global alliance, champions of change, open science</keywords><start-date>1371801600000</start-date><display-name>White House ceremony honoring open science</display-name><path>/2013/06/haussler-white-house</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/06/haussler-white-house</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1371830918476</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1371831184108</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/haussler-stebbins-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/haussler-stebbins-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>haussler-stebbins-350.jpg</name><display-name>haussler-stebbins-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>59904</file-size><width>350</width><height>255</height></image><image-alt>michael stebbins and david haussler</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/haussler-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/haussler-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>haussler-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>haussler-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23622</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>david haussler</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Michael Stebbins, Assistant Director for Biotechnology in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, with UCSC biomolecular engineer David Haussler (right) at the White House ceremony honoring "Open Science Champions of Change."<br/></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>David Haussler, distinguished professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, is among the leaders of a data-sharing alliance that was honored by the White House on Thursday, June 20, at an event highlighting Open Science "Champions of Change."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Haussler and other genomics pioneers <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/06/global-alliance.html">announced the effort to form an international alliance</a> dedicated to enabling secure sharing of genomic and clinical data. At the White House ceremony, the alliance was among 13 leaders and organizations honored for promoting and using open scientific data and publications to accelerate progress and improve our world.</p>
<p>Haussler accompanied David Altshuler of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and other members of the alliance's organizing committee to the White House event, where Altshuler accepted the honor on behalf of the global alliance.</p>
<p>According to a White House statement, open sharing of research results is a proven strategy for driving positive change. For example, the rapid and open sharing of genomic data from the Human Genome Project revolutionized biomedical research and spurred major growth in the biotechnology industry. Haussler's team at UC Santa Cruz was instrumental in allowing open sharing of Human Genome Project data--they assembled the first draft of the human genome sequence and <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/06/human-genome-patents.html">made it available online in 2000</a>, and they created the UCSC Genome Browser, which remains a popular and widely used tool for genomics research.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="684436e28072704668860b1d971e1ad6"><name>galloway-cowell</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Appointment of interim University Librarian</title><summary>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway announces the appointment of M.

At least a year ahead.<br/>
<br/>
The UC Santa Cruz economics professor finished the manuscript for his book <em>Morals and Markets</em> in December 2007, nine months before the beginnings of the worst economic crash since the Great Depression. Many of the book's observations and insights were borne out by events in the weeks and months that followed.<br/>
<br/>
The day <em>Morals and Markets</em> was released &#8211; September 18, 2008 &#8211; the Dow jumped 410 points after two perilous drops. It climbed sharply the next day, too, before losing 25 percent over the next three weeks. It was a beginning of a period that saw bankruptcies of hallowed financial firms, government bailouts on an unprecedented scale, soaring unemployment, and widespread economic misery.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, something was out of balance.</p>
<p><strong>Dangerous balance</strong></p>
<p>A compelling second edition of <em>Morals and Markets</em> (Palgrave/MacMillan, 2013) has just been published in paperback with the new subtitle: <em>The Dangerous Balance</em>. More than half the material is new and the rest significantly edited and rearranged.<br/>
<br/>
This time around, Friedman and co-author Daniel McNeill, a journalist and childhood friend, are able to point to the excesses and reactions to the 2008-2009 crash in the U.S. and subsequent economic events in Europe.<br/>
<br/>
"The crash and the subsequent events illustrate beautifully our theme," Friedman said. "The human species gets by through cooperation; our success depends on cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
"A moral system is what makes us human," Friedman said. "It's a hard thing to describe," he admits, "like the air we breathe." Morals first developed among humans on the African savanna 2&#189; million years ago. The concept of markets followed much later. Financial markets got started in Antwerp and Amsterdam in the early to mid 1600s, and in London decades later.</p>
<p><strong>Rewards and punishment</strong></p>
<p>"Morals tend to reward selfless traits like generosity, trustworthiness, and esprit de corps," Friedman said, "and punish selfish ones like betrayal and theft.<br/>
<br/>
"Markets have made us lords of the earth," he said. "They are competitive arenas that reward pursuit of self-interest&#8212;yet they rely on a moral infrastructure. When participants vie fairly, and buyers and sellers trust each other, they can work magic."<br/>
<br/>
It's the often-unstable balance between them where trouble can arise. Morals can choke markets and markets can corrupt morals.<br/>
<br/>
Friedman's book is accessible to the general public and filled with everyday examples straight out of the news&#8211;Greek austerity measures and the riots that followed, the agony of the Eurozone, the ethics of bailouts, as well as acid rain, the Russian Mafia, poker, and the rescue of the halibut fishery.</p>
<p><strong>'Hands off' regulation</strong></p>
<p>In the first edition of <em>Morals and Markets,</em> Friedman argued that an ideologically driven "hands off" attitude toward regulation since the mid-1990s allowed the economic system to get dangerously out of balance. Today, nearly five years after the 2008 crash, Friedman says, we must understand the dangerous balance of morals and markets&#8212;or we're in for more economic, political, and social debacles again and again.<br/>
<br/>
"Aligning morals and markets so they work together is the premier challenge of our world today," he writes.<br/>
<br/>
Friedman, who received his masters and Ph.D. in mathematics at UCSC, joined the economics faculty in 1985. He has published widely in leading academic journals in economics, finance, psychology, and politics, and is the author of several previous books for an academic audience.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="77c28fbb8072704668860b1d5738d086"><name>meghan-powers</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ocean sciences grad student Meghan Powers featured in UC research profile</title><summary>Graduate student Meghan Powers dives into her work to study bioluminescent marine life.</summary><keywords>Meghan Powers</keywords><start-date>1372060800000</start-date><display-name>Ocean sciences grad student Meghan Powers profiled</display-name><path>/2013/06/meghan-powers</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/06/meghan-powers</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1372103806851</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1372710043701</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/meghan-powers-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/meghan-powers-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>meghan-powers-350.jpg</name><display-name>meghan-powers-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>40109</file-size><width>350</width><height>201</height></image><image-alt>meghan powers diving</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/06/images/meghan-powers-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/06/images/meghan-powers-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>meghan-powers-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>meghan-powers-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19897</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>meghan powers diving</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Meghan Powers collecting a sample of bioluminescent marine life.

<br/>
"I am delighted that UCSC's world-class research and teaching have again been recognized by the Times Higher Education's authoritative analysis," UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal said.<br/>
<br/>
In the key citation index (30 percent of the final score) that measures the influence of an institution's research, UCSC was at the top. This examines a university's research influence by capturing the number of times its published works are cited by scholars across the globe. The data are drawn from the 12,000 academic journals indexed by Thomson Reuters' Web of Science database and include all indexed journals published between 2006 and 2010.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Times Higher Education</em> uses the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2013/one-hundred-under-fifty/methodology">same range of 13 performance indicators</a> to rank institutions for the "100 under 50" as it uses for its <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/">World University Rankings</a> published in the fall, a list on which UCSC ranked 122. There, UCSC ranked second in the world for research influence.<br/>
<br/>
<em>THE</em> said it reduces the weight of subjective indicators for academic reputation and prestige for the younger universities, reasoning that older universities have more time to build up a reputation with deeper, wider, "and more established alumni networks with graduates more likely to hold senior positions in universities and society at large, all of which can bolster their reputations.<br/>
<br/>
"It was agreed that an analysis of younger institutions, designed to examine future potential as much as current excellence and to move away from heritage or legacy, should be based more on hard, objective &#173;performance indicators," <em>THE</em> wrote in its analysis.<br/>
<br/>
The weighting given to reputation has been reduced from a third in the World University Rankings to just over a fifth in the "100 Under 50" list.<br/>
<br/>
UC Santa Cruz and UC Irvine, both founded in 1965, were the only American universities to rank in the top dozen overall on the "100 under 50." Irvine was fifth. Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea was ranked first.<br/>
<br/>
The principal criteria <em>THE</em> uses are:<br/>
&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Research: volume, income and reputation (30 percent);<br/>
&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Citations: research influence; (30 percent);<br/>
&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Teaching: the learning environment (30 percent)<br/>
&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; International outlook: people and research (7.5 percent);<br/>

This is the first planetary system found to have a fully packed habitable zone.</p>
<p>Steven Vogt, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, is on the team of astronomers that made the discovery, which will be published in the journal <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics.</em></p>
<p>"The three planets in the habitable zone are roughly Earth-sized and only about three to four times the mass of the Earth," Vogt said. "The findings are based in part on data that Paul Butler and I have taken over the past 13 years using the HIRES spectrometer on the Keck Telescope in Hawaii."</p>
<p>The team of astronomers--led by Guillem Anglada-Escud&#233; of the University of G&#246;ttingen, Germany, and Mikko Tuomi of the University of Hertfordshire, U.K.--combined the observations from Keck and other telescopes with extensive data collected previously by HARPS (High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher) at the European Southern Observatory's 3.6-meter telescope in Chile.</p>
<p>"These new results highlight how valuable it can be to re-analyze data in this way and combine results from different teams on different telescopes," said Anglada-Escud&#233;.</p>
<p>Gliese 667C is a very well-studied star. Just over one-third the mass of the Sun, it is part of a triple-star system known as Gliese 667 (also referred to as GJ 667), 22 light-years away in the constellation Scorpius (the Scorpion). This is relatively close to us, within the Sun's galactic neighborhood, and much closer than the star systems investigated using telescopes such as the planet-hunting Kepler space telescope.</p>
<p>Previous studies of Gliese 667C had found that the star hosts three planets, including one in the habitable zone. The new study reexamined the system by adding new HARPS observations and data from other telescopes. The team found evidence for up to seven planets around the star. These planets orbit the faintest star of the triple-star system. The two other suns would look like a pair of very bright stars visible in the daytime, and at night they would provide as much illumination as the full Moon. The new planets completely fill up the habitable zone of Gliese 667C, as there are no more stable orbits in which a planet could exist within the zone.</p>
<p>The habitable zone is a thin shell around a star in which water may be present in liquid form if conditions are right. This is the first time that three such planets have been spotted orbiting in this zone in the same system. The three planets in the habitable zone of Gliese 667C are confirmed to be super-Earths--planets more massive than Earth, but less massive than planets like Uranus or Neptune.</p>
<p>"Finding three low-mass planets in the star's habitable zone is very exciting," Tuomi said.</p>
<p>Coauthor Rory Barnes of the University of Washington noted that the discovery suggests that habitable planets may be more numerous that previously thought. "The number of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy is much greater if we can expect to find several of them around each low-mass star. Instead of looking at ten stars to look for a single potentially habitable planet, we now know we can look at just one star and have a high chance of finding several of them," Barnes said.</p>
<p>Compact systems around Sun-like stars have been found to be abundant in the Milky Way. Around such stars, planets orbiting close to the parent star are very hot and are unlikely to be habitable. But this is not true for cooler and dimmer stars such as Gliese 667C. In this case, the habitable zone lies entirely within an orbit the size of Mercury's, much closer to the star than the habitable zone of our Sun. The Gliese 667C system is the first example of a system where such a low-mass star is seen to host several potentially rocky planets in the habitable zone.</p>
<p>The ESO scientist responsible for HARPS, Gaspare Lo Curto, said, "This exciting result was largely made possible by the power of HARPS and its associated software and it also underlines the value of the ESO archive. It is very good to also see several independent research groups exploiting this unique instrument and achieving remarkable precision."</p>

<p>The UC Santa Cruz Farm sprouted a new fence line this spring. Looking west from Coolidge Drive, new deer fencing is visible surrounding the &#8220;Hay Barn&#8221; field, a three-acre addition to the Farm&#8217;s existing 25 acres. Combined with the &#8220;lower quarry&#8221; field, bordered by the bike path and Hagar Drive, the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) is adding five new acres for organic farming, research, and training.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Five acres may not sound like much, but that&#8217;s about a third again as much land as we are actively cultivating down on the Farm,&#8220; said CASFS Executive Director Daniel Press. "This acreage will allow us to dedicate the existing fields for production while we try out new crops and research and teaching techniques on the new fields."<br/>
<br/>
Press will lead a tour of the new acreage Saturday,&#160; June 29, that will include a visit to the historic Cowell Ranch Hay Barn slated to be restored for use as offices, classrooms, and public meeting space.&#160; (See earlier story on the restoration <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/03/hay-barn.html">here</a>.) The tour will take place from 10 a.m. to noon and the public is invited. (Details below.)<br/>
<br/>
Plans for the newly fenced Hay Barn field include growing crops for UCSC Dining Services to boost the supply of fresh produce available directly from the Farm to campus dining halls, said&#160; Darryl Wong, CASFS farm site and research lands manager.</p>
<p><strong>New fields, new opportunities</strong></p>
<p>The expanded acreage will also offer new opportunities for members of the CASFS Apprenticeship training course, who spend six months at UCSC learning organic farming and gardening skills.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Growing larger blocks of crops than is now possible on existing farm fields will give our apprentices an opportunity to experience organic farming practices on a larger scale than what the farm currently offers,&#8221; Wong said.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
The new fields also create more space for research by campus faculty and collaborators. According to Wong, because the Hay Barn field has not been actively cultivated before, it presents an opportunity to observe what happens to the soil as it is converted to an organic agroecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Research projects<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>Possible research projects include analyzing the weed seed bank for the types and amounts of weed seeds present, measuring changes to the amount of soil organic matter, and testing the ability of anaerobic soil bacteria to suppress pathogens, such as those that plague strawberries.<br/>
<br/>
UCSC undergraduates will have the chance to be involved in both farming and research using the new fields. This spring, students in the Environmental Studies Agroecology Practicum class collected vegetation and insect samples in the Hay Barn field to establish baseline data before they were tilled. Wong envisions a series of courses and internships that will give students the chance to gain hands-on experience in crop planning and production.<br/>
<br/>
The Hay Barn and Lower Quarry fields were annexed to the UCSC Farm about 10 years ago in exchange for land used by the Ranch View Terrace housing development.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>A public tour of the UCSC Farm and the new Hay Barn field and Hay Barn restoration project is scheduled for Saturday, June 29. The public is invited to join CASFS Executive Director Daniel Press for strawberry shortcake starting at 10 a.m. at the Louise Cain Gatehouse on the UCSC Farm before touring the sites. Please RSVP by June 26 by calling (831) 459-3240 or by email to <a href="mailto:casfs@ucsc.edu">casfs@ucsc.edu</a>.</em><br/>

Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An international team of scientists has sequenced the genome of an ancient horse that lived 700,000 years ago in the early Middle Pleistocene epoch. It is by far the oldest genome scientists have been able to sequence (almost ten times older than the previous record) and was obtained from DNA fragments extracted from a bone scientists recovered from permafrost in Canada's Yukon Territory.</p>
<p>The team's analysis of the ancient horse's genome, published June 26 in <em>Nature</em>, sheds light on the evolution of horses and the relationship between domestic horses and the wild Przewalski horse.</p>
<p>Researchers at UC Santa Cruz led by Beth Shapiro, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, were involved in several aspects of the study, including the characterization of the field site where the bone was found (at Thistle Creek in the Yukon) and the sequencing, assembly, and analysis of the ancient horse's genome. Mathias Stiller, a postdoctoral researcher in Shapiro's lab, sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes (small cellular genomes separate from the nuclear chromosomes) of other ancient horses, which the researchers used to confirm the exceptionally old age of the Thistle Creek horse that is the main focus of the study.</p>
<p>"This is exciting in that it pushes back the time in which DNA is recoverable by nearly an order of magnitude," Shapiro said. "The bone was recovered from the oldest known permafrost, so it is a special case. Had it not been frozen for the entire duration of that 700,000 years, I doubt that any recoverable DNA would have survived. As a consequence, it's a real treasure!"</p>
<p>First author Ludovic Orlando of the Center for GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark led the project and coordinated the efforts of researchers around the world. The team was able to track major genomic changes in the evolution of the horse lineage over the past 700,000 years by comparing the genome of the Thistle Creek horse with the genomes of a 43,000-year-old Late Pleistocene horse, six present-day horses, and a donkey.</p>
<p>The researchers estimated how fast mutations accumulated over time in the horse lineage and calibrated a genome-wide mutation rate to use as an evolutionary "clock." This revealed that the last common ancestor of all modern horses, donkeys, and zebras lived about 4 to 4.5 million years ago, twice as long ago as previously thought. In addition, this new clock revealed multiple episodes of severe demographic fluctuation in horse history, in phase with major climatic changes such as the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The researchers also analyzed the genome to look for evidence of interbreeding between modern domestic horses and the Przewalski horse, a wild horse of the Mongolian steppes that is physically distinctive and has an extra pair of chromosomes. The evolutionary origin of this horse, discovered by the Western world in the second half of the nineteenth century, has remained a mystery. It almost became extinct in the wild by the mid-1950s, but was saved by massive conservation efforts. James Cahill, a Ph.D. student in Shapiro's lab, assisted in an analysis indicating that pure Przewalski horse lineages, with no detectable levels of admixture with domestic breeds, are still living today. The study found that the Przewalski and domestic horse populations diverged sometime between 38,000 and 72,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The study also identified genomic regions in domestic horse breeds that show low levels of genetic variation compared to the Przewalski horse and could correspond to genetic variants selected early on in the domestication process.</p>
<p>"In order to really tease out the evolutionary changes associated with horse domestication, we need to know where the genes are in the genome and what they do, which means we need a better annotated genome of the modern horse," Shapiro said. "But using these older genomes is a great start--it can point us to regions of the genome that appear to have been evolving under selection for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years. Now we just have to figure out why."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://pgl.soe.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UCSC Paleogenomics Lab</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="82501df98072704668860b1d69092b24"><name>news-article</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Blow the Whistle on Government Fraud, Waste and Abuse - UCOP</title><summary>The University of California is committed to maintaining the highest standards of conduct in the fulfillment of its education, research, public service and patient care mission.</summary><start-date>1372233600000</start-date><display-name>Blow the Whistle on Government Fraud, Waste and Abuse - UCOP </display-name><path>/2013/06/news-article</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/06/news-article</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1372280855993</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1372282705950</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span><span>The University of California is committed to maintaining the highest standards of conduct in the fulfillment of its education, research, public service and patient care mission. Our faculty and staff are encouraged to bring forward concerns about possible improper governmental activity directly to their supervisor, department head, locally designated official or any university administrator. In order to provide employees with multiple avenues for bringing forward concerns of possible wrongdoing, the UC Whistleblower Hotline was established.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The hotline is independently operated to allow for calls or web-based reporting from faculty, staff and students on an anonymous basis. The hotline relays the reported concerns to appropriate university officials for processing. This hotline is staffed seven days a week, 24 hours per day and is capable of receiving reports in a number of different languages.</span></span></p>
<span></span> 
<p><span><span>The university-wide toll-free number is</span></span> 1-800-403-4744<span><span>. Web-based reports can be made by accessing <a href="http://universityofcalifornia.edu/hotline" target="_blank">http://universityofcalifornia.edu/hotline</a>. More information about the whistleblower process is found on the University of California home page and on posters displayed in various employee areas. The university&#8217;s whistleblower poster identifies other channels for reporting improper governmental activity, including the California State Auditor and the California Attorney General.</span></span></p>
<span></span> 
<p><span><span>The California Government Code requires every state agency, including the University of California, to distribute to its employees annually a message from the California State Auditor that provides an explanation of the California Whistleblower Protection Act. This email contains the California State Auditor&#8217;s message for 2013.</span></span></p>
<span></span> 
<p><span><strong><span>Message from the California State Auditor&#8217;s office</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The California State Auditor&#8217;s office is your confidential avenue for reporting improper activities by state agencies or employees. It is your responsibility as a government employee to report any type of fraud, waste, or abuse, which ultimately protects scarce state resources.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2012 alone, the State Auditor received 5,505 inquiries and complaints from state employees and members of the public, most of which concerned misuse of state property, improper travel expenditures, and time and attendance abuse. Whistleblower complaints have triggered investigations revealing millions of dollars in wasteful spending in recent years, such as:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Three individuals, including two state employees, perpetrated a fraudulent scheme to obtain state documents without paying the required fees. The individuals were convicted of bribery and ordered to pay restitution to the State.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> A state employee helped two accomplices illegally obtain nearly $93,000 in unemployment benefits over a two-year period through a conspiracy to defraud the department. The employee and one accomplice were sentenced to federal prison and the second accomplice was sentenced to three years probation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> A department overpaid 18 employees nearly $119,000 over a two-year period by inappropriately paying them an hourly overtime rate for work they performed rather than the hourly straight-time rate they were entitled to receive.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>WHAT TO REPORT</strong></span></p>
<span></span> 
<p><span>Pursuant to Government Code section 8547.2, subdivision (b), improper acts by a state agency or employee that should be reported to the State Auditor include:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Violations of state or federal law, including theft, fraud, or conflict of interest;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Noncompliance with an executive order or Rule of Court;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Noncompliance with the <em>State Administrative Manual</em> or the <em>State Contracting Manual</em>;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Misuse or waste of state resources including property or employee time; and</span></p>
<p><span><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Gross misconduct, incompetence, or inefficiency.</span></p>
<p><span>The State Auditor does not have the authority to investigate violations of internal department policies or procedures.<br/>
<br/>
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>WHISTLEBLOWERS ARE PROTECTED</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If you report an impropriety, you are protected by the Whistleblower Protection Act, which:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Requires the State Auditor to protect your identity (except from law enforcement);</span></p>
<p><span><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Prohibits intimidation, threats, or coercion by state employees that could interfere with your right to disclose improper governmental activities.<br/>
<br/>
</span></p>
<p><span>If you believe that you have been retaliated against for disclosing an improper governmental activity, you should report this immediately to one of the following agencies:<br/>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&#183;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> State and court employees: write to the State Personnel Board at 801 Capitol Mall, MS53, Sacramento, CA 95814.</span></p>

Now, for the first time, scientists can see how the ribosome performs the precise mechanical movements needed to translate genetic code into proteins without making mistakes.</p>
<p>"This is something that the whole field has been pursuing for the past decade," said Harry Noller, Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology at UC Santa Cruz. "We've trapped the ribosome in the middle of its movement during translocation, which is the most interesting, profound, and complex thing the ribosome does."</p>
<p>Understanding ribosomes is important not only because of their crucial role as the protein factories of all living cells, but also because many antibiotics work by targeting bacterial ribosomes. Research on ribosomes by Noller and others has led to the development of novel antibiotics that hold promise for use against drug-resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>Noller's lab is known for its pioneering work to elucidate the atomic structure of the ribosome, which is made of long chains of RNA and proteins interlaced together in complicated foldings. Using x-ray crystallography, his group has shown the ribosome in different conformations as it interacts with other molecules. The new study, led by postdoctoral researcher Jie Zhou, is published in the June 28 issue of <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>To make a new protein, the genetic instructions are first copied from the DNA sequence of a gene to a messenger RNA molecule. The ribosome then "reads" the sequence on the messenger RNA, matching each three-letter "codon" of genetic code with a specific protein building block, one of 20 amino acids. In this way, the ribosome builds a protein molecule with the exact sequence of amino acids specified by the gene. The matching of codons to amino acids is done via transfer RNA molecules, each of which carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome and lines it up with the matching codon on the messenger RNA.</p>
<p>"The big question has been to understand how messenger RNA and transfer RNA are moved synchronously through the ribosome as the messenger RNA is translated into protein," Noller said. "The transfer RNAs are large macromolecules, and the ribosome has moving parts that enable it to move them through quickly and accurately at a rate of 20 per second."</p>
<p>The key step, called translocation, occurs after the bond is formed joining a new amino acid to the growing protein chain. The transfer RNA then leaves that amino acid behind and moves to the next site on the ribosome, along with a synchronous movement of the messenger RNA to bring the next codon and its associated amino acid into position for bond formation. The new study shows the ribosome in the midst of a key step in this process.</p>
<p>"This gives us snapshots of the intermediate state in the movement," Noller said. "We can now see how the ribosome does this with a rotational movement of the small subunit, and we can see what look to be the 'pawls' of a ratcheting mechanism that prevents slippage of the translational reading frame."</p>
<p>Many antibiotics interfere with the function of the bacterial ribosome by preventing or retarding this translocational movement. Understanding the structural and dynamic details of this movement could help researchers design new antibiotics.</p>
<p>Translocation involves two steps (as Noller's lab showed back in 1989). Step one is the movement of the tRNA's "acceptor end" (where it carried the amino acid). This leads to a hybrid state, with the two ends of the tRNA in two different sites on the ribosome: the "anticodon end" is still lined up with the matching mRNA codon in one site, while the acceptor end has moved on to the next site. Step two is the movement of the tRNA's anticodon end together with the messenger RNA, which advances by one codon. Step two requires a catalyst called elongation factor G (EF-G). The new study shows the ribosome in the middle of step two, with EF-G bound to it and the tRNA halfway between the hybrid state and the final state.</p>
<p>Noller has spent decades working to understand how the ribosome works. Being able to see how it moves, he said, is an exciting moment.</p>
<p>"This is one of the most fundamental movements in all of biology, at the root of the whole mechanism for translation of the genetic code, and we now understand it all the way down to the molecular level," Noller said. "This mechanism had to be in place around the origin of life as we know it."</p>
<p>In addition to Noller and Zhou, the coauthors of the paper include postdoctoral researcher Laura Lancaster and research specialist John Paul Donohue. This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<br/>
"I think we are clearly moving toward a radical new context for gays and lesbians -- the stigma is lifting (more quickly than I might have imagined 10 years ago), " said Phillip L. Hammack, UCSC associate professor of psychology and co-editor of the Oxford Series on Sexuality, Identity &amp; Society. Hammack responded by email from Puerto Rico where he is attending meetings of the William T. Grant Foundation.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
The foundation recently awarded Hammack a five-year $350,000 research grant. He is examining how lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth respond to stress and stigma in their communities and how community-based organizations might work with them to create more positive climates.<br/>
<br/>
"As a social psychologist, I think about issues like the effects of stigma or support for harassment and violence, as well as the effects of unequal treatment (social injustice) on how gays and lesbians view themselves and their relationships," Hammack said.<br/>
<br/>
He said his initial reaction on hearing news of the rulings was "that this is really an incredibly historic day for sexual minorities in the U.S. We've clearly reached a turning point in society with the recent swing toward a majority of Americans supporting same-sex marriage and now these two Supreme Court decisions which, while not as sweeping as they might have been, still represent clear civil rights victories for millions of gay and lesbian Americans.<br/>
<br/>
"All of this means a better and kinder life course for gays and lesbians, with fewer health and mental health problems and fewer stressors from discrimination," Hammack said.&#160; "Their relationships are increasingly being recognized as legitimate and worthy of recognition, and their struggle is being seen more and more through the lens of basic civil rights."<br/>
<br/>
However, he also cautioned that life for sexual minorities may still be difficult depending on where they live. While 13 states recognize same sex marriage now that California's ban is lifted, 37 others do not.<br/>
<br/>
"There is a lot of variation in how communities treat gay and lesbian people and how they view non-heterosexual orientation," Hammack said. "So, while I think the trajectory is promising for the psychological well being of gays and lesbians, we need to start looking more at local communities, to really get the microscope in on how gays and lesbians in different types of communities across the nation are faring."<br/>

<br/>
Administered by UCSC&#8217;s Language Program in the Humanities Division, the faculty affiliated with the major will come from 10 departments across three divisions.<br/>
<br/>
The interdisciplinary major in Spanish Studies is designed to offer students the linguistic competence and cultural literacy required to understand the perspectives of diverse Spanish-speaking communities.<br/>
<br/>
The major will help students gain a broad understanding of the historical and cultural developments of the countries in which Spanish is a national language, as well as those regions in which Spanish is employed in contact with other languages.<br/>
<br/>
In the interest of advanced linguistic and cultural proficiency, the core of the new major will be comprised of courses taught in the Spanish language.<br/>
<br/>
Students will be able to choose from two tracks that allow more in-depth study--literature and culture, or language and linguistics.</p>
<p>The curriculum draws upon UCSC&#8217;s Literature, History, Anthropology, Education, Feminist Studies, History of Art and Visual Culture, Latin American and Latino Studies, Linguistics, and Sociology Departments.</p>
<p>Spanish Studies will also encourage students to take advantage of the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP language and culture programs are focused primarily on language acquisition.</p>
<p>Many of these programs provide students with the language skills needed to participate in regular university courses taught in the language of the host country. EAP opportunities in Spanish include Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Spain and Costa Rica.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The study of the Spanish language</strong> and its diverse cultural groups is of special importance in the United States, the country with the second largest Spanish-speaking population in the world.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;After more than six years of efforts, the faculty and staff involved are delighted to see the major approved,&#8221; noted Juan Poblete, UCSC professor of literature and provost of Kresge College, who helped to develop the proposal for the new degree.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;UCSC students will now have another option to learn and live the language and cultures of Spanish speaking countries including the U.S.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;While many of us are very involved with the Latin American and Latino Studies Department in the Social Sciences Division, the Spanish major presents a Spanish-taught and Humanities-based alternative that will be, we hope, very appealing to many of our students. It will combine, in an interdisciplinary setting, the strengths of History, Applied Linguistics, Literature, and Cultural Studies.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
M. Victoria Gonz&#225;lez-Pagani, director of Spanish Studies at UCSC, noted that the major comes at a very opportune time since the Latino student population has been increasing considerably on campus in recent years.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Students are excited at the news of the Spanish major,&#8221; said Pagani.&#160; &#8220;Since the moment they found out we were working on a proposal they have been asking about it, and expressing their desire to pursue this major.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Indeed, it is very good news for the students and a wonderful addition to the variety of majors UCSC offers,&#8221; she added.<br/>

<p>Gehry, often described as one of the most important and influential architects of our time, will appear along with his fellow recipients at the dinner scheduled for October 18 at the Cocoanut Grove in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Also honored will be <strong>Don and Diane Cooley,</strong> Watsonville residents who are long-time advocates and supporters of UCSC; <strong>Jock Reynolds,</strong> a UCSC alumnus and director of the Yale University Art Gallery; and <strong>Howard Haber and Abraham Seiden,</strong> UCSC researchers.</p>
<p>The Foundation Medal, UCSC's equivalent to an honorary degree, recognizes individuals of exceptionally distinguished achievement whose work and contribution to society exemplify the vision and ideals of the university.</p>
<p>Gehry is being recognized as an outstanding exemplar of the 2013 Founders Celebration theme of "Creativity, Innovation and the Arts." Among the qualities being celebrated are his exuberant creativity, openness to collaboration, willingness to take risks, and his love of the interplay of the arts.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day for the annual <strong>UC Santa Cruz Foundation Forum</strong>, Gehry will be the featured guest in a conversation with Paul Goldberger, a leading architecture critic and a contributing editor at <em>Vanity Fair.</em> Goldberger is currently writing an authorized biography of Gehry.&#160;</p>

<p>The Cooleys, who have deep roots in the Pajaro Valley, will receive the Fiat Lux Award, presented to alumni and friends of UCSC who have demonstrated outstanding achievement, dedication, and service in support of the campus.</p>
<p>The Cooleys are longstanding stewards and advocates of the UCSC Arboretum. They created the Thomas B. Porter Scholarship in honor of Diane's father, and they have donated to the UCSC Opera Theatre, Shakespeare Santa Cruz, Long Marine Lab, the Natural Reserves, and the Robert Sinsheimer Chair in Molecular Biology.</p>
<p>Don Cooley is a former president and long-time trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, and Diane Cooley is a founder and member of the UCSC Opera Circle.</p>
<p>Jock Reynolds (Stevenson '69, psychology), artist and director of the Yale University Art Gallery, will receive the Alumni Achievement Award.</p>
<p>Reynolds has created and shown his own artwork widely while also promoting fellow artists by organizing scores of other exhibitions, publications, and artist-in-residence programs.</p>
<p>He received two National Endowment for the Arts Visual Artists fellowships, among many other grants and honors accorded him.&#160; During the last 25 years, he has directed the highly regarded teaching museums at Andover and Yale, whose collections are among the nation&#8217;s finest.</p>
<p>Howard Haber and Abraham Seiden will be honored as Faculty Research Lecture awardees. Selected by UCSC's Academic Senate to deliver the annual lecture, both Haber and Seiden are celebrated physics professors and researchers.</p>
<p>Haber is particularly well known for his role in developing theories and the attendant phenomenology of the Higgs boson ("phenomenology" involves the application of theory to experiments in high-energy particle physics).</p>
<p>He coauthored the definitive book on searching for the Higgs boson, <em>The Higgs Hunter's Guide</em>, published in 1989. A fellow of the American Physical Society, Haber received a prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Research Award in 2009.</p>
<p>Seiden, distinguished professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, led the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) from its founding in 1981 until 2010, when he stepped down as director to return to full-time teaching and research.</p>
<p>Seiden is currently leading a consortium of U.S. physicists working on a new particle detector that will be the first major upgrade for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's most powerful particle accelerator.</p>
<p>The annual Founders Celebration will continue with the Maitra Lecture December 5, which will be delivered by renowned theater, opera, and festival director <strong>Peter Sellars,</strong> a professor in the department of World Arts and Cultures at UCLA who is a recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, as well as a recent inductee into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>Gehry continues to make front page news with new, ongoing and future projects. Hired by Facebook to design its expansion at its Menlo Park headquarters, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-facebook-frank-gehry-new-york-20130604,0,6416567.story">Gehry will also design Facebook&#8217;s New York City offices.</a>&#160;This summer, the Eisenhower Memorial Commission <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-19/entertainment/40068030_1_eisenhower-memorial-commission-gehry-design-frank-gehry">unanimously approved Gehry&#8217;s design for a memorial to Dwight D.

<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226;&#160;The nighttime Kiosk Guard Program will end effective August 31.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226;&#160;Redeployment of the funding&#160;currently supporting the Kiosk Guard Program will be used to hire two&#160;additional police officers for campus patrol.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; The campus is providing additional funding to&#160;support one new police officer position.&#160;&#160;In summary, we will add three law enforcement officer positions to the&#160;department.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>With these changes, the campus will have increased its&#160;law enforcement staffing to 19.5.&#160;&#160;This will enable us to have a minimum of two officers on duty at all&#160;times with additional&#160;officers in the evenings available for response to our&#160;residential communities, evening events, research lab safety, libraries and for&#160;other areas of campus.&#160;&#160;In my&#160;judgment, increasing&#160;the presence and availability of patrol officers is the&#160;most effective way to deploy department resources and improve public safety&#160;throughout the campus.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>The&#160;decision to redeploy Kiosk Guard Program resources to fund two additional&#160;officers was not an easy one to reach. The review and analysis was conducted in&#160;collaboration with&#160;several key managers across campus and consideration was&#160;given to best practices on other UC campuses.&#160;&#160;In the&#160;end,&#160;&#160;I concluded that having more&#160;police officers in the field and&#160;available to serve the campus in the areas of&#160;patrol, investigations, and during times of emergency response was a higher&#160;operational priority &#8212; and in the best interest of campus&#160;safety.</span></div>

<div><span>The&#160;Kiosk Guard Program has provided a long-standing service to the campus and the staff&#160;who have served in the night guard positions have been very committed and&#160;professional.&#160;&#160;I am very thankful&#160;for the contributions that they have made to the community.</span></div>

<div><span>The&#160;planned elimination of night Kiosk staffing will not change the daytime parking&#160;services provided by TAPS at the main entrance Kiosk.</span></div>
