<p>David Kirk developed video and media libraries at UCSC. Now he's arranged for a planned gift that will support McHenry Library far into the future.</p>
<p>"I just feel that if you've got it, you should share it," said Kirk, retired media specialist for McHenry.</p>
<p>Borrowing and slightly abridging a famous line from the musical Hello Dolly, Kirk said: "Money is like manure. You have to spread it around to make things grow. That's become my little theme. I want to make a gift that keeps on giving, a gift that does not go away."<br/>
<br/>
 Kirk, who won the Outstanding Staff Member of the Year Award in 2000-2001, has a longstanding and affectionate connection to the campus and, in particular, the library.</p>
<p>He started working at UCSC in 1972. Ten years later he started at McHenry, where the media collection included one video machine, one VHS player, and a single videotape given by friends of the library. By the time he retired 30 years later, McHenry had more than 20,000 titles, including an impressive GLBT collection.</p>
<p>Kirk worked closely with professors putting their courses together while consulting with undergraduates working on senior thesis projects and Ph.D. candidates requiring DVDs and other media for their dissertations.</p>
<p>Upon leaving, Kirk wanted to make sure his legacy continued. In addition to the planned gift, he set up a video endowment to protect the future. "The money it generates every year allows staff to buy at least 10 or 12 needed items for faculty."</p>
<p>He also helped support a GLBT book endowment.</p>
<p>Kirk, a book lover since age 4, has left his mark on the library&#8212;and now part of it even bears his name.</p>
<p>Shortly after the gala rededication of McHenry following its renovation and expansion the flashy new media center was named after Kirk to honor his past work at the library as well as his long history of giving. Head Librarian Ginny Steel asked him if he would mind having the Media Center named for him.</p>
<p>"Two seconds later," laughed Kirk, "I said yes."</p>

She was 88 years old and is survived by her husband Glenn, daughters Judith Ball and Rosanne Townsend (both UCSC graduates), sons-in-law Terry Ball (Cowell College 1967) and David Townsend, seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren.</p>
<p>Glenn and Jean Willson regularly hosted all kinds of events for students and faculty at the Provost's House. Jean was known for her animated presence, good humor and sense of style. She always worked to make Stevenson College into a true community. As faculty fellow Ronnie Gruhn recounts, "Jean's sociability, good cheer, graciousness, interest in the arts and engagement with all who crossed her path, served the Stevenson community well." Committed to providing a humane social setting for everyone at the college, Jean enjoyed spending time with the gardeners and maintenance staff as well with homesick freshmen and busy faculty. She lobbied successfully for establishment of the Stevenson Coffee house to provide the community with an informal and comfortable gathering place. Her efforts are acknowledged by a plaque in the coffee house to Jean," the founding mother."</p>
<p>Jean's daughter, Judith, gave a moving eulogy commemorating her mother's life and the joy she spread to all who knew her:</p>
<blockquote>We are here to celebrate the life of Jean, wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother and friend, much loved by all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>She was a complex character, at heart a Scots Puritan and at the same time someone who loved informality and openness.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We remember her warmth, charm, irreverence and wit and particularly enjoyed her sideways humor. She was always a little fey and playful and one of her greatest gifts was her amazing ability to talk easily to anyone, draw them out and listen to them with honest interest and full attention. She was a wonderful mimic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Jean was a matchless, supportive partner to Glenn for nearly 70 years, helping him with his professional responsibilities, not only entertaining countless guests, participating in numerous ceremonies with grace and charm but also, providing sharp and useful critiques of Glenn&#8217;s prose.&#160; While she always&#160;&#160; played the role of hostess with consummate ease, it was in spite of her desire for a more private life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Jean always delighted her children and grandchildren with her imaginative storytelling, creative fantasies, singing and dancing. Sadly her two great grand daughters will not be so privileged. Jean was a great reader and loved books. Her daughters remember many wonderful hours of book discussions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Having lived on four continents over a period of 25 years, Jean amassed an army of friends, all of whom loved her zany comments on life, her support and friendship.</blockquote>
<blockquote>She will be much missed by all.</blockquote>

<p>The fact that Baker, a farmer, is unshod is unusual. But what's even more noteworthy is his age. While the population of U.S. farmers grows older &#8212; the average age is now 57, according to the Department of Agriculture &#8212; Baker is just 29.</p>
<p>"It's really challenging," admits the cultural anthropology and environmental studies major as he stands on the rich, alluvial soil of his Corralitos land. "It's not easy to start the first generation of a farm."</p>
<p>Still, Baker, a 2007 graduate of UC Santa Cruz's Kresge College, is not the kind of guy who gives up.</p>
<p>Baker's introduction to farming came when he was still attending UCSC. He got a job at a cut-flower farm and found himself falling in love with the work. After a stint with Happy Girl Kitchen, where he spent his days buying produce from area farmers and absorbing their knowledge, he decided to go out on his own.</p>
<p>"I had a bit of cash saved up and I bought a 1963 John Deere tractor and just went for it," Baker says.</p>
<p>Baker located a seven-acre parcel of land to lease and named his operation Lonely Mountain Farm after a hill that is home to a clan of dwarves in J.R.R. Tolkien's famous trilogy. (I'm kind of a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> nerd," he admits.) Then, he got to work.</p>
<p>He tilled the soil, dug trenches, and piped water to the plot. He planted potatoes and beans &#8212; crops that had a long shelf life and also filled a market niche. Daily, he fought the unreliable tractor and weeds that rose among the seedlings he planted.</p>
<p>"I was completely flailing around," he says.</p>
<p>"Even in the best conditions, starting a farm is a struggle," says Nesh Dhillon, director of Santa Cruz Community Farmers' Markets where Baker now sells his harvest. "It's weather-dependent, and an organic farm means you can't just solve a problem by putting something on it."</p>
<p>Still, Baker persevered and, four years later, he is selling crops that range from Native American Hidatsa Shield beans to Delicata squash and heirloom tomatoes in four Bay Area farmers' markets. He also is cultivating an additional plot of land his parents bought and where he now lives with his girlfriend, Molly Davenport, and his sister and his brother-in-law, Dawn and Tim Sternadel.</p>
<p>Still, life on the land is not easy. At 6 a.m. Baker makes himself a cup of coffee and goes out to feed the goats, peacocks, and horses that populate his farm. By 7, he's headed for his greenhouse where he figures out the day's agenda based on what he finds. His 10-hour days are filled with weeding, irrigating, planting, harvesting, and dealing with whatever problems arise.</p>
<p>"He's got such drive and desire," says Baker's mother, Kelly, a fifth-grade teacher in Southern California. "He believes in what he does. He's driven by the cause &#8230; of fresh, organic, local food."</p>
<p>Baker gives a tour of his newest farm property as bees dance amid rows of golden sunflowers and his two dogs, an Australian shepherd named Oso and a border collie named Cubby, scramble through acres of tilled soil. There's a large barn, a gypsy wagon he built by hand to serve as a farm stand, an old yellow school bus he uses to haul crops. There is talk of his sister's recent wedding on the farm, and dinners he and his housemates have together most nights: squash stuffed with rice, chard, and goat cheese; big salads; Jerusalem artichokes saut&#233;ed in olive oil.</p>
<p>In time, Baker hopes this acreage, which nestles between two swells of land, will not only grow a rich variety of crops but also serve as an educational venue for kids, hold a goat-cheese production area and a small kitchen, and possibly host events.</p>
<p>"I think I have a good vision," he says. "I can look into the future and see a result."</p>
<p>That's what keeps Baker going. That's what keeps his bare feet firmly planted on the land.</p>

By using the online application, and picking up your permit before September 20th, you&#8217;ll&#160;avoid the &#8220;crush&#8221; of Fall Quarter, and will minimize the amount of time spent standing in line. Due to the heavy volume of permit&#160;applications, please allow up to four business days to process your parking permit.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Permits ordered on-line after tomorrow (September 6th) will not be mailed out, but held for pick up at the TAPS Sales Office between 7:00am-5:00pm,&#160;Monday through Friday. From September 23&#8211;26, a tent will be erected in Lot 116 (intersection of Carriage House and&#160;Ox Team Roads) specifically to distribute these prepaid permits; the tent will be staffed between 7:00am-4:00pm.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 If you use quarterly permits, you can renew up to one month in advance; use the online application, and then bring your permit to the&#160;Sales Office for a new sticker.<br/>

Noyce Scholarships support students who are committed to teaching science or mathematics in high-need school districts upon the completion of a teacher credential program.</p>
<p>The NSF grant provides continued funding for Noyce Scholarships at UCSC and supports partnerships between UCSC, seven community colleges, and four high-need school districts to enhance recruitment and retention of new teachers in key areas of district shortages, said Gretchen Andreasen, director of UCSC's <a href="http://calteach.ucsc.edu/">California Teach Program</a> (Cal Teach) and principal investigator on the grant.</p>
<p>Cal Teach is a successful undergraduate support program for prospective math and science teachers, providing internships, coursework, and scholarships. Between the Noyce Scholarships and the Mark Bruce Fellowships funded by UCSC alumnus Stephen Bruce, Cal Teach has been able provide substantial scholarships for most of the program's graduates who have gone on to earn a teaching credential and M.A. in education at UCSC, Andreasen said.</p>
<p>The new NSF grant will also support transfer students from community colleges who are interested in teaching math and science, providing up to 10 transfer students with 3 years of scholarship support to complete their undergraduate degree plus a graduate credential program. An additional 32 students will receive one year of scholarship support for the credential program.</p>
<p>UCSC's community college partners in this project are Cabrillo College, Ca&#241;ada College, Foothill College, Gavilan College, Hartnell College, Ohlone College, and San Jos&#233; City College. The school district partners are East Side Union High School District, Gonzales Unified School District, Pajaro Valley Unified School District, and Santa Cruz City Schools.</p>
<p>"We have had success so far putting good math and science teachers in schools around the region, and the new Noyce Scholarship funds will help us collaborate effectively with the community colleges," Andreasen said. "Community colleges are often in high-need communities, and the prospective teachers we recruit tend to go back to those communities to teach."</p>
<p>For example, by recruiting students from Hartnell College in Salinas to enter the Cal Teach program, UCSC can support prospective math and science teachers who are likely to return to the area and teach at Gonzales High School, where there is a need for well-prepared math and science teachers, she said.</p>
<p>The new program's recruitment efforts will also extend to Silicon Valley professionals who may be interested in a career-change to teach math or science. They will be able to enroll in UCSC's new Silicon Valley-based teaching credential program starting in the 2014-15 academic year.</p>
<p>Most of the new NSF grant will go toward scholarships. The Noyce funds will also support intensive K-12 teaching experiences for UCSC and community college students in all four partner school districts. So far, about 500 UCSC students have done at least one Cal Teach internship, and of those who have graduated, about 30 percent have gone on to earn a teaching credential, Andreasen said. Cal Teach also has teacher induction programs to support new teachers in the partner districts. More than two dozen former Cal Teach students are now teaching at schools in Watsonville, Santa Cruz, the Salinas Valley, and the San Jose region.</p>
<p>The new NSF grant includes some funding for research on the outcomes of the scholarship program. In addition, separate grants from NSF are funding in-depth research programs on science and math education led by education professors Lora Bartlett and Trish Stoddart.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="09c104058072704649da30c3850bd4c8"><name>constitution-day-2013</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Constitution Day on September 17</title><summary>Federal law requires that all schools receiving federal funds provide information on the United States Constitution every year on Constitution Day, September 17, the anniversary of the signing of our country's founding document.</summary><start-date>1378800000000</start-date><display-name>Constitution Day on September 17</display-name><path>/2013/09/constitution-day-2013</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/09/constitution-day-2013</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1378848146361</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1379522716848</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Campus Updates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/09/images/constitution-day.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/09/images/constitution-day.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>constitution-day.jpg</name><display-name>constitution-day.jpg</display-name><file-size>21310</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div class="article-body">

But help may be on the way: A new crowdsourcing tool developed at UC Santa Cruz lets students get involved in the grading.</p>
<p>CrowdGrader (<a href="http://www.crowdgrader.org">www.crowdgrader.org</a>) allows students to submit their homework online and then distributes the submitted solutions anonymously to other students in the class for grading. Using a novel crowdsourcing algorithm that relies on a reputation system to assess each student's grading accuracy, CrowdGrader combines the student-provided grades into a consensus grade for each submission. As an incentive to take the grading task seriously, each student's overall grade for an assignment depends in part on the quality of his or her work as a grader.</p>
<p>Luca de Alfaro, professor of computer science at UCSC's <a href="http://soe.ucsc.edu">Baskin School of Engineering</a>, worked with graduate student Michael Shavlovsky to develop CrowdGrader. They have been evaluating it for programming assignments (C++, Java, and Android) in computer science classes taught by de Alfaro and others at UCSC and at the University of Naples in Italy. Though still an experimental project, the preliminary results are encouraging, de Alfaro said.</p>
<p>"My impression is that the accuracy is not perfect, but it's no worse than what a TA does. There is always imprecision in grading," he said. "The real benefit is in the learning experience."</p>
<p>Grading other students' work actually helps students develop their programming skills, he said, because they get to see how other students have solved the same problem. Also, because their own work is graded by up to five other students, they get more feedback than they do from a teaching assistant.</p>
<p>"TAs are fairly consistent in the way they grade the homework submissions, but they tend to have schematic grading criteria that focus on some things and might miss others. From what I saw, the feedback from students gave a more holistic evaluation of the students' work," de Alfaro said.</p>
<p>De Alfaro and Shavlovsky described CrowdGrader in a recent technical report (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5273">arxiv.org/abs/1308.5273</a>), which also presents the results of preliminary user studies. While more user studies are under way, de Alfaro said that he was happy with the results so far. He plans to use CrowdGrader in more classes this fall.</p>
<p>Crowdgrader is available online (<a href="http://www.crowdgrader.org">www.crowdgrader.org</a>), and anybody can use it. "It's hosted on a very stable platform, so if anybody wants to try it for their own classes, they can," de Alfaro said.</p>
<p>This work was supported in part by a Google Research Award for de Alfaro's work on crowdsourced ranking.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0e9f643b8072704649da30c39859b32e"><name>kahn-carrie</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Getting at the truth</title><summary>NPR foreign correspondent Carrie Kahn (College Eight '87, biology) braves tough situations to report the news, with both heart and grit.</summary><keywords>Carrie Kahn, NPR</keywords><start-date>1378886400000</start-date><display-name>Getting at the truth</display-name><path>/2013/09/kahn-carrie</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/09/kahn-carrie</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1378929828864</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1378932932588</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/09/images/kahn-carrie.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/09/images/kahn-carrie.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kahn-carrie.jpg</name><display-name>kahn-carrie.jpg</display-name><file-size>40536</file-size><width>300</width><height>401</height></image><image-alt>Carrie Kahn</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/09/images/kahn-carrie-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/09/images/kahn-carrie-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kahn-carrie-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>kahn-carrie-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18363</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Carrie Kahn</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>NPR foreign correspondent Carrie Kahn (College Eight '87, biology) (photo courtesy&#160;<span class="credit">Doby Photography</span><span>/</span><span class="rightsnotice">NPR)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>NPR foreign correspondent Carrie Kahn braves tough situations to report the news, with both heart and grit</article-subhead><article-text><p>As thousands of exhausted survivors from Hurricane Katrina huddled in Houston's Astrodome, Carrie Kahn, a reporter for National Public Radio, noticed a pastor helping refugees into a ratty old van.</p>
<p>The minister told Kahn he was taking people to Sunday service. Kahn decided to tag along, spending the next days reporting the story of how a tiny black church took in as many refugees as it had parishioners: 100 people it fed, clothed, and housed.</p>
<p>"Carrie is more than just a reporter," says the pastor, Ronald Smith of the New Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Houston, remembering how Kahn used her own resources to help reunite a mother with her missing 14-year-old son. "Her heart is in what she does," says Smith. "There's nobody like Carrie."</p>
<p>"Heart" may be how Smith describes Kahn (College Eight '87, biology), now a foreign correspondent for NPR based Mexico City. But listen to Kahn's body of work, and a picture also emerges of a woman who consistently braves tough situations in order to get at the truth.</p>
<p>Kahn has covered stories from modern-day slave farms to the massive earthquake in Haiti to a double-crossing DEA informant and allegations of euthanasia at a New Orleans hospital after hurricane Katrina. For a series on crime and violence in Latin America, Kahn traveled to the world's deadliest city&#8212;San Pedro Sula in Honduras&#8212;where she ventured into a notorious prison and the area's worst neighborhood in order to delve into the cause of that city's brutality.</p>
<p>Kahn, like all good foreign correspondents, has "boundless curiosity, a passion for new places and people, an eye for detail, a sense of humor, and the tenacity to keep asking questions and running down leads to get the most accurate, honest, and impartial version possible," says Didrik Schanche, deputy international editor for NPR.</p>
<p>"I like being in the middle of things and taking people to an event, being the eyes and ears for them," says Kahn, whose familiar voice fills a telephone interview. "My job is challenging and exhausting sometimes, but I also think it's an important role as we lose more and more of that first-person reporting."</p>
<p>Kahn, 50, didn't start out to be an award-winning journalist. At UCSC, she planned to become a research scientist. But after working in a genetics lab in Central America and watching civil war rage in Guatemala and the Iran-Contra scandal emerge in Nicaragua, her focus changed.</p>
<p>She returned to Santa Cruz, where she worked for the bilingual newspaper <em>El Andar</em> and then got an internship with radio station KUSP. Jobs followed at KPBS in San Diego and KQED in San Francisco, as her journalistic star rose.</p>
<p>It was while working in Los Angeles in 2010 that Kahn saw an early report of a massive earthquake in Haiti. She sent an email to an NPR editor.</p>
<p>"I'll go," she said.</p>
<p>Within hours, Kahn was on a plane, becoming the first NPR reporter inside that ravaged country. She followed doctors as they treated wounded survivors and watched dazed relatives wander through bodies stacked three and four deep outside the city's morgue. She slept outdoors wrapped only in a tablecloth for warmth, and returned six times to report on rebuilding efforts and questions about how the Red Cross and other charities were using the money they had collected.</p>
<p>It's that kind of tough, on-the-ground reporting that has made a name for Kahn but also, she admits, it's what has taken a psychological toll. In order to cope with the tragedy and suffering she witnesses, she does things like raise money for a tiny Haitian school and stays in touch with the people whose stories she has covered&#8212;like Pastor Smith at that little Houston church.</p>
<p>"Stuff like that makes me feel better," Kahn says. "I hope I'm not just a journalist who comes in and gets what they want and then leaves."</p>
<p>Now living in Mexico City with her husband, Ramon Beristain; children Isabella, 13, and Mimi, 11; along with a cat named Phebo and a dog named Mona, Kahn is facing the new task of chronicling the economic, educational, and political challenges in a region plagued with poverty, corruption, and drug violence.</p>
<p>Kahn says she doesn't have "any grand illusions of changing the world," but does believe in the importance of exposing corruption, of asking tough questions, and of "holding people's feet to the fire."</p>
<p>"I really believe democracy depends on a free and independent press," Kahn says. "In this time, when the press is becoming very fractured and where newspapers are in great peril, I think it's important there are still reporters out there who have an independent streak and are on the spot doing first-person reporting."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

awarded a 2013 <a href="http://www.pgfusa.com/">Princess Grace Foundation</a> Honorarium in the category of documentary film.</p>
<p>A second-year student in the Arts Division&#8217;s Social Documentation master&#8217;s program, Jackson received the award for her project on the shuttering and privatizing of Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles.<br/> <br/> Miyamoto, who will be a senior this fall in the Film and Digital Media undergraduate program, earned her award for a film exploring the formation of solidarity between native Hawaiians and the U-wa tribe in Colombia as they struggle against extinction.<br/> <br/> The Princess Grace Foundation-USA is a public charity that was created to continue the legacy of Grace Kelly, Princess of Monaco, who anonymously helped emerging artists pursue their goals throughout her lifetime. It awards scholarships, apprenticeships, and fellowships to assist artists at the beginning of their careers.</p>
<p>The Foundation has cultivated a diverse group of over 600 artists to date who continue to advance the field of performing arts with cutting-edge theater, dance, choreography, film, playwriting and design.<br/> <br/> Jackson is a filmmaker who has focused her work on media literacy and documentaries, specifically on youth and community-based issues.<br/> <br/> She is the recipient of several other awards, including a UC Regent&#8217;s Fellowship, a UCSC Porter College Fellowship, and a Florence French Scholarship. Jackson is also a graduate fellow with the UC Center for New Racial Studies.<br/> <br/> Miyamoto has written and illustrated articles for <em>Women&#8217;s Surf Style Magazine</em> in Hawaii and the Third World and Native American Student Press Collective (TWANAS) in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alongside my responsibility as a young Native Hawaiian woman, this film adds to my dedication to use art for social justice,&#8221; said Miyamoto. &#8220;This film is the union of my long term artistic, personal and career goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>UCSC's master's program in social documentation was established in 2005 and was a first in the University of California system. The graduate program is designed to teach students to translate academic knowledge into visual, audio, and print media that will have an impact on the world.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="12b5f9a48072704649da30c3c12fe639"><name>sea-otter-census</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>California's sea otter numbers continue slow climb</title><summary>California sea otter numbers are up, according to the latest population survey led by federal, state, and UCSC scientists. </summary><keywords>sea otters, sea otter population, Tim Tinker, sea otter census</keywords><start-date>1378999800000</start-date><display-name>California's sea otter numbers continue slow climb</display-name><path>/2013/09/sea-otter-census</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/09/sea-otter-census</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1378998417745</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1410902916844</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ben Young Landis, USGS</name><title></title><phone/><email>blandis@usgs.gov</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/09/images/sea-otters-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/09/images/sea-otters-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sea-otters-375.jpg</name><display-name>sea-otters-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>114757</file-size><width>375</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>sea otter with pup</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/09/images/sea-otters-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/09/images/sea-otters-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sea-otters-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sea-otters-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>28845</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>sea otter with pup</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The annual sea otter survey counted a record number of pups, although the number of adult otters was about the same as last year.

The reasons: more pups and the addition of San Nicolas Island sea otters to the population count.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, U.S. Geological Survey scientists have calculated an averaged population index each year for the southern sea otter <em>(Enhydra lutris nereis),</em> a <a href="http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=A0A7">federally listed threatened species</a> found in California. For the 2013 report, USGS lists the population index as 2,941 (<a href="http://www.werc.usgs.gov/project.aspx?projectid=91">data online</a>). For southern sea otters to be considered for removal from threatened species listing, the population index would have to exceed 3,090 for three consecutive years, according to the threshold established under the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/ventura/species_information/so_sea_otter/index.html">Southern Sea Otter Recovery Plan</a> by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<p>"Population growth in central California has faltered recently, so the fact that we're seeing a slightly positive trend is a basis for cautious optimism," said Tim Tinker, a biologist with <a href="http://werc.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz and the USGS Western Ecological Research Center</a> who supervises the annual survey. "Certainly, sea otters have made an impressive recovery in California since their rediscovery here in the 1930s. But as their numbers expand along California's coast, they are facing different 'growing pains' in different locales. Our research partnership is investigating the factors responsible for these local trends."</p>
<p>Researchers from the <a href="http://www.werc.usgs.gov/">USGS</a>, UC Santa Cruz, <a href="http://www.dfg.ca.gov/ospr/">California Department of Fish and Wildlife's Office of Spill Prevention and Response</a>, <a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/sorac.aspx">Monterey Bay Aquarium</a>, and other institutions collaborate annually to conduct the sea otter survey. The population index reported to USFWS is calculated as multiple-year averages of raw data from annual surveys to compensate for year-to-year variability in observation conditions and to give scientists a more reliable picture of sea otter abundance trends.</p>
<p>"We counted a record number of pups this year, which led to the uptick in the 3-year average," said USGS biologist Brian Hatfield, coordinator of the annual survey. "A high pup count is always encouraging, although the number of adult otters counted along the mainland was almost identical to last year's count, so we'll have to wait and see if the positive trend continues."</p>
<p>There is a second reason for the higher population index reported this year. In 2013, the equation for this population index was amended to add sea otters living at San Nicolas Island. One-hundred-and-forty sea otters were introduced to the island in the 1980s as part of a USFWS recovery experiment, but most of them returned to the mainland, died, or simply disappeared. USFWS completed an extensive review of the translocation program in December 2012, resulting in termination of the program. As a consequence, sea otters at San Nicolas Island are no longer considered to be an "experimental" population and will now be included as part of the California-wide population index for southern sea otter recovery. The population at the island is now at 59 individuals.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Statewide Trends and Local Questions</strong></p>
<p>USGS scientists also annually update a database of sea otter strandings, recording the number of dead, sick, or injured sea otters recovered along California's coast each year. In 2012, scientists from CDFW, USGS, Monterey Bay Aquarium, and other institutions came across <a href="http://www.werc.usgs.gov/project.aspx?projectid=232">a total of 368 stranded sea otters</a>.</p>
<p>This stranding number only accounts for sea otters that people find, and past research indicates that possibly less than 50 percent of sea otters that die in the wild end up on the beach. But efforts are made to examine each reported sea otter carcass, and a subset of fresh carcasses are sent to the CDFW <a href="http://www.dfg.ca.gov/ospr/Science/marine-wildlife-vetcare/">Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center</a>, where scientists <a href="http://www.dfg.ca.gov/ospr/Science/marine-wildlife-vetcare/seaotternecropsy.aspx">conduct necropsies to determine the primary causes of death</a> and identify factors that may have contributed to the death of each animal.&#160;</p>
<p>Data from both living and deceased sea otters continues to shed light on sea otter population ecology in different parts of the California coast. For example, a high proportion of sea otter carcasses recovered between Cayucos and Pismo Beach in recent years have white shark bite wounds, a potential explanation for the downward trend in sea otter numbers in that area. In Elkhorn Slough, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/08/sea-otters-seagrass.html">a new study</a> suggests that sea otter appetites for crabs can improve the health of seagrass beds. And at the southern end of their mainland range, researchers are observing sea otter feeding and movement behavior to understand their slow southward expansion.</p>
<p>"Overall trends are important, but they can mask problems that may be affecting only a portion of the population," says Lilian Carswell, Southern Sea Otter Recovery Coordinator for USFWS. "These regional research projects help us understand the effects of local influences, whether human-caused or natural, and inform the overall southern sea otter recovery strategy."</p>
<p><strong>Survey Methodology</strong></p>
<p>&#8226;&#160; The annual population index is calculated from visual surveys conducted along the California coastline by researchers, students and volunteers from USGS, CDFW's Office of Spill Prevention and Response, Monterey Bay Aquarium, UC Santa Cruz, USFWS, U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and Santa Barbara Zoo.</p>
<p>&#8226;&#160; Surveys are conducted via telescope observations from shore and via low-flying aircraft, typically from April through June. This year, the surveyed coastline spanned Point San Pedro in San Mateo County, south to Rincon Point near the Santa Barbara/Ventura County line, and also included San Nicolas Island.</p>
<p>&#8226;&#160; The annual survey was interrupted in 2011, when weather conditions prevented the mainland survey's completion.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Otter Facts</strong></p>
<p>&#8226;&#160; Sea otters were presumed extinct in California after the fur trade years, but were rediscovered in the 1930s by the public, when as few as 50 animals were documented persisting in nearshore areas off the coast of Big Sur.</p>
<p>&#8226;&#160; Sea otters are considered a keystone species of the kelp ecosystem because they prey on herbivorous invertebrates that, if left unchecked, can decimate kelp beds and the fish habitat they provide.</p>
<p>&#8226;&#160; Scientists also study sea otters as an indicator of nearshore ecosystem health, since sea otters feed and live near the coast and often are the first predators exposed to pollutants and pathogens washed down from coastlands, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/otter-toxin.html">such as the microbial toxin microcystin</a>.</p>

<p>Program director Brenda Romero (formerly Brenda Brathwaite) came to UC Santa Cruz in January 2013 as the first <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/12/brenda-romero.html">game designer in residence</a> at the <a href="https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/games-and-playable-media">Center for Games and Playable Media</a>, where she has been teaching and advising students. A game designer, artist, writer, and creative director who entered the video game industry in 1981 at the age of 15, she received the 2013 Women in Games Lifetime Achievement Award from Microsoft for her contributions to the game industry.</p>
<p>John Romero is well-known as a programmer, game designer, and artist whose development work spans more than 100 commercially published games and includes iconic games such as Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM, and Quake. He has cofounded eight successful game companies, including id Software, Gazillion Entertainment, and Loot Drop, and remains active in the game industry. As creative director of the Games and Playable Media master's program at UCSC, he will teach courses, mentor students, and help shape the overall creative vision for the program.</p>
<p>"We are very excited to have two highly accomplished veterans of the game industry coming on board to direct our new professional degree program," said Jim Whitehead, professor and chair of the Computer Science Department. "They have been involved in the development of a huge number of games and game studios, and they have created some of the most influential games, both in mainstream culture and in the art world."</p>
<p>Both John and Brenda Romero also have experience leading well-regarded game programs at other universities. Brenda Romero served as chair of the Savannah College of Art and Design's Interactive Design and Game Development department, while John Romero helped establish the Digital Games Guildhall program at Southern Methodist University.</p>
<p>As program director at UCSC, Brenda Romero oversees the curriculum and instructors, teaches and mentors students, and builds connections with companies in the computer game industry. The program's advisory board features leading game developers, including Will Wright (Stupid Fun Club), Harvey Smith (Arkane), Derek Yu (Spelunky), Robin Hunicke (Funomena), Ben Prunty (FTL), and Brian Schwab (Blizzard).</p>
<p>"Industry connections are very important for this program, so that students can interact with people in the game industry through visiting speakers, master classes, internships, and other opportunities," she said. "The individuals on our advisory board represent a diverse cross-section of the game industry, from the hard-core AAA space to those defining the indie space."</p>
<p>The <a href="http://gpm.soe.ucsc.edu">M.S. in games and playable media</a> is a yearlong (12-month) degree focused on combining technical and design innovation. The program includes a project-oriented, yearlong course sequence in which students work in teams to create innovative games, critiqued and mentored by the creative director.</p>
<p>John Romero's role as creative director will be to push students beyond what they already know to create novel possibilities for playable experiences. "In creating games, I look for innovative ways to explore spaces and game mechanics, doing things other games have not done," Romero said. "In working with UCSC, my goal is to push students toward innovation while working on my own new indie projects alongside them."</p>
<p>The computer games industry has been growing rapidly. In 2010, U.S. consumers bought $25 billion worth of computer games and equipment, up from $8 billion in 2000. UCSC launched its highly successful undergraduate degree in computer game design in 2006. According to Whitehead, demand for graduates from that program has been high, even in a depressed economy, with average starting salaries around $80,000. The new M.S. degree program addresses a similar need at the graduate level, he said.</p>
<p>Brenda Romero noted that it will be important for the program's curriculum to adapt as the game industry changes over time. "I'll be looking ahead at what's going to be happening in the industry two years down the road, so we can prepare students for that," she said.</p>
<p>Brenda Romero has worked with a variety of digital game companies as a game designer or creative director, including Atari, Sir-tech Software, Electronic Arts and numerous companies in the social and mobile space. In recent years, she has become known for an award-winning series of non-digital games titled "The Mechanic is the Message." She has served on the board of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) and chaired the IGDA&#8217;s Women in Games Special Interest group, and currently serves on the advisory board of the International Center for the History of Electronic Games at the Strong Museum of Play. She was named one of Forbes magazine's "12 Women in Gaming to Watch" in 2013.</p>
<p>John Romero is considered to be among the world's top game designers and programmers, and his products have won every major award. One of the earliest independent developers, he began working in the game space in 1979 on mainframes before moving to the Apple II in 1981.

Some of the images were never published before, particularly from his life in Algeria,&#8221; Hull added. <br/> <br/> Coded QR codes allow the viewer to select the nature of the information experienced (magenta equals context/background; codes with a symbolic eye equal zoom in; with a quotation mark equal citations; and with an arrow in a white circle equal audio or video).<br/> <br/> Recordings include Camus&#8217;s Nobel acceptance speech in Stockholm, and zooms include articles he wrote anonymously during WWII for an underground paper and copies of manuscript pages.<br/> <br/> Hull added that viewers will also have the chance to upload their own picture with a time and location stamp onto a&#160; global mosaic which will be scrollable and accessible to anyone who has downloaded the exhibit&#8217;s app.<br/> <br/> This exhibit is free and open to the public. It runs through November 14. Open hours are 9 a.m.to 4:30 p.m.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="289787f58072704649da30c359ff6881"><name>move-in-2013</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz prepares to welcome new, returning students for fall 2013</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz students are scheduled to begin moving into university housing Wednesday, September 18, in anticipation of fall quarter for the 2013-14 school year.

"Move-in" for students living on campus will continue through Sunday, September 22.<br/> <br/> Approximately 4,300 new undergraduate students are expected when fall-quarter classes begin Thursday, September 26. UCSC is also expecting approximately 420 new graduate students.<br/> <br/> Of the new undergraduate students, 3,300 will be new freshmen and 1,000 new junior-level transfers; with nearly 98 percent of transfer students coming directly from California's community colleges. Cabrillo College accounts for the largest number of transfer students with 144 joining the campus this fall.<br/> <br/> &#8220;The start of a fall quarter is truly an exciting time,&#8221; said Michael McCawley, UCSC&#8217;s director of admissions. &#8220;We were more selective in admissions for both frosh and transfers this year, so our incoming students are academically talented and well-prepared to succeed in their studies.</p>
<p><strong>More globally diverse</strong><br/> &#8220;We have students coming from throughout California, from other states, and other countries, making for a more globally diverse class,&#8221; McCawley said. &#8220;California students make up more than 90 percent of our incoming frosh and we have transfer students coming from 95 of the state's 112 community colleges &#8211; those numbers reflect our commitment to California residents.&#8221; &#160;<br/> <br/> Almost 40 percent of the 2013 freshman class will be comprised of students from ethnic backgrounds that have been traditionally underrepresented within the UC system &#8211; African-American/Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Hispanic ethnicities.The 39.8 percent is slightly higher than last fall's 39.2 percent, continuing an upward trend. Fall 2011's class included 33.9 percent of students from underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/> This fall's freshman class is also expected to comprise 34 percent from Hispanic or Latino backgrounds and 28 percent who are Asian American. Approximately 31 percent identify themselves as white/Caucasian. The percentage of African American students is expected to increase to 4.8 percent from 4 percent a year ago and from 3.6 percent two years ago. Unknown or unspecified ethnicity is 1.5 percent.<br/> <br/> "That we were able to slightly increase our ethnic diversity is a tribute to all the hard work of our campus community, especially our students,&#8221; McCawley said. &#8220;We must continue to be attentive to the ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity of our incoming students.&#8221;<br/> <br/> Forty-four percent of incoming frosh are first-generation students where neither parent has a four-year college degree. Students coming from low-income households (below $40,000 annually) comprise a little more than 33 percent of incoming frosh.<br/> <br/> Non-resident students, those coming from other states and other countries, will make up slightly more than 8 percent of the new frosh.<br/> <br/> <strong>Academic interests</strong><br/> More than one-quarter (28.3 percent) of the incoming freshman class has yet to declare a major.<br/> <br/> Among the frosh who have indicated a major:</p>
<ul>
<li>23.6 percent intend to major in the Physical &amp; Biological Sciences &#8211; most popular major: molecular, cell, and developmental biology;</li>
<li>22.9 percent in the Social Sciences &#8211; most popular: psychology;</li>
<li>16.2 percent in Engineering &#8211; most popular: computer science;</li>
<li>5.2 percent in Humanities &#8211; most popular: literature;</li>
<li>3.8 percent in the Arts &#8211; most popular: film &amp; digital media.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/> <strong>2013&#8211;2014 projected enrollment</strong><br/> Final enrollment for the fall quarter will not be known until after the third week of classes.&#160; UCSC's three-quarter average enrollment for the 2013-2014 academic year is projected to be 16,450, approximately 300 fewer than were enrolled in the 2012-2013 academic year.<br/> <br/> <strong>Housing UCSC students</strong><br/> UCSC has assigned approximately 8,100 of the nearly 8,400 bed spaces available in university provided housing this fall. Included are about 4,100 continuing students who will be living in campus-provided housing again this year.</p>
<p>At Merrill College, a renewal project began this summer that includes a facelift for the exteriors of the nearly 45-year-old Merrill A and B residence halls. Inside, 215 rooms were updated with new paint, carpet, lighting, windows, and furniture; new lounges and social spaces were created and improvements added for energy efficiency. The project includes completely renovated bathrooms, new accessible bathrooms, expanded laundry rooms in A, and new card access door locks.<br/> <br/> A welcome for new students and opening day activities are scheduled at Merrill for Saturday.<br/> <br/> <strong>Move-in schedule</strong><br/> Detailed information about move-in activities may be found at: <a href="http://housing.ucsc.edu/move-in/">housing.ucsc.edu/move-in/</a> Information about transportation, parking lot availability, and closures is available at: <a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/">taps.ucsc.edu/</a><br/> <br/> <strong>Welcome Week activities</strong><br/> Once new students arrive, numerous events and activities are planned to welcome them to campus, as well as welcome back returning students. Sessions include tours of the library and other campus resources, as well as academic advising.<br/> <br/> Specific activities include the annual back-to-school trip to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, Monday evening, September 23, and the OPERS Fall Festival, Tuesday, September 24. Details on the many activities are available at: <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/orientation/">admissions.ucsc.edu/orientation/</a>.</p>

<div><br/>
 This is an exciting period for our students and their families, and an excellent opportunity for us to welcome them to our University and community.&#160;However, residential Move In has impacts on campus parking and traffic and we ask for your patience and flexibility. It is important to note the following&#160;restrictions and alternative parking options:&#160;<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>&#8226; Most of the lots near colleges, and all three remote lots, will be restricted for Move In purposes on different days during Move In.</strong><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 <strong>&#8226; Vehicles without a valid Move In permit will be cited if they park in restricted lots.</strong>&#160;(Vehicles with disability-related permits or placards are the&#160;exception to this rule.)<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>&#8226; Because of these restrictions, those with A, B, or R permits may need to find alternative parking.</strong>&#160;Please check the day-specific maps for non-restricted parking options listed above. Those with R permits will be able to park in&#160;<a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/ermap.pdf">East Remote Overflow Lots&#160;4 and 5</a>&#160;during Move In.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>&#8226; From Wednesday through Sunday, one-way traffic controls will be in place on Porter-Kresge Road.&#160;</strong>Traffic will only be allowed to go from Kresge to Porter; no traffic will be allowed to drive into the Porter entrance.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>&#8226; From Friday through Sunday, Hagar Drive will be closed to downhill traffic at Steinhart Way.</strong><br/>
</div>
We anticipate thousands of additional vehicles on campus for the move-in period; this creates a significant challenge for the campus community, particularly&#160;on Friday. Principal officers and managers are encouraged to consider alternative work sites for staff members at the discretion of the supervisor,&#160;if&#160;operationally feasible. We strongly encourage the use of alternative transportation options to get to campus (such as sharing a ride with a friend or&#160;colleague) to help accommodate the new student traffic.<br/>
 <br/>
 If you have questions about these changes to parking and traffic flow, please contact Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) at 459-2190 or&#160;<a href="mailto:taps@ucsc.edu">taps@ucsc.edu</a>.&#160;&#160;Thank you in advance for helping to support a smooth start to the new academic year.<br/>

Others have pledged to don a Sammy the Banana Slug costume, give up coffee, and wear a tutu to work for a month.</p>
<p>The reason for all this odd behavior? It's part of a creative crowdfunding effort taking place from Sept. 18 to Oct. 30 at UCSC and throughout the rest of the University of California system.</p>
<p>The goal is to raise need-based scholarships and grants for Californian students hit by rising college costs &#8212; especially those from middle-class families who don't qualify for as much traditional financial aid.</p>
<p>For generations, the University of California has provided the brightest Californians access to a world-class education at an affordable price. But state cutbacks over the past five years have meant that instead of California covering 78 percent of a student's education costs, it now covers just 39 percent.</p>
<p>At UCSC, nearly 78 percent of students apply for some kind of need-based financial aid. Many take on loans and part-time jobs to pay for their education.</p>
<p>That's why UC Santa Cruz is participating in the system-wide <a href="http://www.promiseforeducation.org/">Promise for Education</a> effort, which will provide <b>direct scholarships and grants</b> to undergraduates from California who need financial help. The dollars raised will be <b>in addition to</b> money students already receive from traditional financial aid programs.</p>
<p>The idea is simple &#8212; and fun.</p>
<p>1.)&#160; Starting Sept. 18 alumni, students, faculty, staff, celebrities, and political leaders &#8212; anyone, really &#8212; can log on to PromiseForEducation.org and make a promise. The promises can be inspiring, quirky, motivating, or adventurous. Learn Klingon? Run a marathon? Any creative undertaking works.</p>
<p>2.)&#160; &#160;The promise-maker sets a crowdfunding goal. It can be any amount, from $100 to $25,000.</p>
<p>3.)&#160; The promise-maker blasts their promise and fundraising goal via social media like Facebook or Twitter, and/or email.</p>
<p>4.)&#160; Recipients are directed to a promise-maker's personalized page on PromiseForEducation.org where they can contribute money toward the set goal.</p>
<p>5.)&#160; Funds may be designated for a particular campus like UC Santa Cruz, or the entire UC system, and will go directly to help fund scholarships for students.</p>
<p>6.)&#160; When the fundraising goal is met, the promise-maker must perform his or her promise! Promisors are asked to share proof of the completion of the promise on the website so all of their supporters can see.</p>
<p>UCSC Chancellor Blumenthal has set a <a href="http://promises.promiseforeducation.org/Georgespromise">personal fundraising goal</a> of $10,000 and is already warming up his voice. He's also urging others to either create their own promises and begin fundraising themselves, or log onto <a href="http://www.promiseforeducation.org/">PromiseForEducation.org</a> and find a promise that inspires them to give.</p>
<p>It's a great way to make a difference in a deserving student's life.</p>

The total is down 6 percent from the previous year, a reflection of the impact on funding agencies of the federal budget cuts known as the sequester.</p>
<p>Although the sequester did not officially take effect until March 1, 2013, federal agencies began to change their funding patterns months in advance of that date in anticipation of the reductions in their budgets.</p>
<p>The fiscal impact of the sequester on UC and other research institutions nationwide has been estimated at a drop of 6 to 8 percent in the level of federal support, according to Scott Brandt, vice chancellor for research. "Despite this drop, our five-year trend is positive, and this is the eighth consecutive year that UCSC grants and contracts awards exceeded $100 million," he said.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, UCSC has received nearly $667 million in research funding.</p>
<p>During fiscal year 2013, the federal government funded 88.1 percent of the grants and contracts awarded to the campus, while private foundations accounted for 6.3 percent. The single largest funding source was the <a href="http://nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a> ($33 million), followed by <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> ($32 million) and the <a href="http://nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> ($25 million). The <a href="http://www.moore.org/">Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</a> was the campus's largest source of private funding, with awards totaling more than $2.5 million.</p>

Fairlie has conducted research in labor economics for more than 20 years. <br/><br/>Alejo's bill passed the Assembly in May. Last week, the Senate passed the bill with amendments on a vote of 26-11; the Assembly later approved the amended version. Gov. Jerry Brown is expected to sign it. <br/><br/>If the bill becomes law, the current $8-an-hour minimum wage in California will jump to $9 in July 2014 and to $10 in January 2016, the highest in the nation. The federal minimum wage is $7.25. <br/><br/>The increases in the amended bill are greater and come sooner than in Alejo's original bill. The Senate further removed a provision that called for annual adjustments based on inflation after 2017. <br/><br/>In his testimony, Fairlie said a California worker making the current $8 minimum wage would have to work 58 hours per week for an entire year to be at the federal poverty line of $23,283 a year.<br/><br/>Fairlie said 10 states currently index their minimum wage to cost of living<br/>changes. These include Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. <br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/09/documents/fairlie-ca-min-wage-testimony.pdf</url><title>Professor Rob Fairlie's Senate testimony</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="327069dd8072704649da30c3f3c719c9"><name>diller-gift</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> UCSC to receive $500,000 in support of endowed chair in Jewish Studies</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has announced a major new gift to support the campus’s Jewish Studies Program. </summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, jewish studies, ucsc jewish studies, ucsc center for jewish studies, murray baumgarten </keywords><start-date>1379615100000</start-date><display-name> UCSC to receive $500,000 in support of Jewish Studies</display-name><path>/2013/09/diller-gift</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/09/diller-gift</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1379530729894</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1382123015533</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Jewish Studies</value><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport </name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/09/images/Diller-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/09/images/Diller-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Diller-200.jpg</name><display-name>Diller-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>48160</file-size><width>200</width><height>210</height></image><image-alt>Helen Diller</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/09/images/diller-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/09/images/diller-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>diller-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>diller-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21044</file-size><width>81</width><height>81</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Helen Diller</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Helen Diller (Photo by r.r. jones)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, has announced a major new gift to support the campus&#8217;s Jewish Studies Program. <br/><br/>The Helen Diller Family will contribute $500,000 toward the establishment of a new <em>Baumgarten Endowed Chair in Jewish Studies</em>.<br/><br/>A previous gift from the Dillers in 1997 established the Helen Diller Family Endowment for Jewish Studies at UCSC. &#160;<br/><br/>That initial seed funding helped to create UCSC&#8217;s <em>Center for Jewish Studies</em>&#8212;which has evolved over the past 16 years into a sophisticated center of research and learning, serving the largest number of enrolled undergraduates in Jewish Studies at any Northern California post-secondary institution. <br/><br/>A $1 million fundraising effort is currently underway to establish the Baumgarten Endowed Chair. The Chair will be held by a senior level faculty scholar who will guide a mature and expanding Center for Jewish Studies.<br/><br/>The Dillers&#8217; latest gift now raises the total of designated funds to $700,000.<br/><br/>&#8220;We are delighted to receive this generous gift from the Dillers to support our expanding Jewish Studies program,&#8221; said UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal. &#8220;Their new gift celebrates the legacy they helped to create and assures the future vitality of our Center for Jewish Studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that their lead gift will motivate others to step forward and help us fully fund the chair,&#8221; he added. <br/><br/>The Baumgarten Chair will honor the accomplishments of Jewish Studies scholar and teacher Murray Baumgarten, whose interdisciplinary vision of Jewish Studies has guided the program at UCSC for nearly three decades. <br/><br/>Baumgarten, along with UCSC history professor Peter Kenez, still teaches the annual upper division course <em>The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry</em> that was created in the mid-1980s and is now also an online class reaching nearly 18,000 people in 58 countries, and he had an essential role in developing UCSC&#8217;s new B.A. degree in Jewish Studies which the university began offering in 2010. <br/><br/>&#160;&#8220;Murray Baumgarten&#8217;s unique leadership made the establishment of a premier Jewish Studies program at UC Santa Cruz a reality,&#8221; the Dillers noted. &#8220;We are pleased to be able to honor his vision.&#8221; <br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/06/3899.html</url><title>UC Santa Cruz approves new major in Jewish Studies</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/09/images/helen-diller-216.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/09/images/helen-diller-216.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>helen-diller-216.jpg</name><display-name>helen-diller-216.jpg</display-name><file-size>14195</file-size><width>216</width><height>90</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Helen Diller</thumb-alt><title>The Helen Diller Family</title><description>The Helen Diller Family will contribute $500,000 toward the establishment of a new Baumgarten Endowed Chair in Jewish Studies.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="32c7a7498072704649da30c3e7ebc83b"><name>deer-rutting-season</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Deer Alert - Rutting Season </title><summary>This time of year drivers and cyclists need to be extra vigilant about deer darting into roadways. </summary><start-date>1379491200000</start-date><display-name>Deer Alert - Rutting Season </display-name><path>/2013/09/deer-rutting-season</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/09/deer-rutting-season</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1379536447225</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1379536447225</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>This time of year drivers and cyclists need to be extra vigilant about deer darting into roadways. It is deer rutting season, when the bucks are in hot pursuit of mates. Deer will often run across roads, appearing to come out of nowhere as the mating season progresses. <br/> <br/>Please drive cautiously, especially along wooded roadways with little visibility. Even in open spaces, deer can be running at top speed, oblivious to oncoming vehicles. With the return of students to campus this fall, especially new students unfamiliar with the campus, the risk of hitting a deer or causing an accident by stopping suddenly or swerving is at its peak. <br/> <br/>Various local organizations and campus departments assume responsibility for providing some animal services and or advice. If the animal appears to be a danger, is injured or may be injured, please call the campus police at (831) 459-2231, if there is an immediate danger, dial 9-1-1. <br/> <br/>Another resource is Native Animal Rescue, (831) 462-0726. They will not pick up wildlife, it must be transported to them. <br/>For more information see the UCSC Police Department&#8217;s Animal Control website at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://police.ucsc.edu/services/animal.html">http://police.ucsc.edu/services/animal.html</a></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>UCSC Grounds Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="36f76a278072704649da30c316d1228e"><name>deep-earthquake</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Seismologists puzzle over largest deep earthquake ever recorded</title><summary>A magnitude 8.3 earthquake that struck deep beneath the Sea of Okhotsk on May 24 was the largest deep earthquake ever recorded.</summary><keywords>deep earthquakes, Sea of Okhotsk earthquake, Thorne Lay</keywords><start-date>1379613600000</start-date><display-name>Seismologists puzzle over largest deep earthquake ever recorded</display-name><path>/2013/09/deep-earthquake</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/09/deep-earthquake</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1379606686100</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1379613397878</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/09/images/slab-diagram-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/09/images/slab-diagram-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>slab-diagram-375.jpg</name><display-name>slab-diagram-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>75698</file-size><width>375</width><height>356</height></image><image-alt>diagram of subduction zone</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/09/images/figure-1-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/09/images/figure-1-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>figure-1-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>figure-1-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>31016</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>map of earthquake</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The world's largest recorded deep earthquake occurred on May 24, 2013, at a depth of 609 km in the subducting Pacific plate beneath the Sea of Okhotsk near Kamchatka, Russia, as shown in the schematic vertical cross-section above and on the map below.

At a depth of about 609 kilometers (378 miles), the intense pressure on the fault should inhibit the kind of rupture that took place.</p>
<p>"It's a mystery how these earthquakes happen. How can rock slide against rock so fast while squeezed by the pressure from 610 kilometers of overlying rock?" said Thorne Lay, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Lay is coauthor of a paper, published in the September 20 issue of <i>Science,</i> analyzing the seismic waves from the Sea of Okhotsk earthquake. First author Lingling Ye, a graduate student working with Lay at UC Santa Cruz, led the seismic analysis, which revealed that this was the largest deep earthquake ever recorded, with a seismic moment 30 percent larger than that of the next largest, a 1994 earthquake 637 kilometers beneath Bolivia.</p>
<p>Deep earthquakes occur in the transition zone between the upper mantle and lower mantle, from 400 to 700 kilometers below the surface. They result from stress in a deep subducted slab where one plate of the Earth's crust dives beneath another plate. Such deep earthquakes usually don't cause enough shaking on the surface to be hazardous, but scientifically they are of great interest.</p>
<p>The energy released by the Sea of Okhotsk earthquake produced vibrations recorded by several thousand seismic stations around the world. Ye, Lay, and their coauthors determined that it released three times as much energy as the 1994 Bolivia earthquake, comparable to a 35 megaton TNT explosion. The rupture area and rupture velocity were also much larger. The rupture extended about 180 kilometers, by far the longest rupture for any deep earthquake recorded, Lay said. It involved shear faulting with a fast rupture velocity of about 4 kilometers per second (about 9,000 miles per hour), more like a conventional earthquake near the surface than other deep earthquakes. The fault slipped as much as 10 meters, with average slip of about 2 meters.</p>
<p>"It looks very similar to a shallow event, whereas the Bolivia earthquake ruptured very slowly and appears to have involved a different type of faulting, with deformation rather than rapid breaking and slippage of the rock," Lay said.</p>
<p>The researchers attributed the dramatic differences between these two deep earthquakes to differences in the age and temperature of the subducted slab. The subducted Pacific plate beneath the Sea of Okhotsk (located between the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Russian mainland) is a lot colder than the subducted slab where the 1994 Bolivia earthquake occurred.</p>
<p>"In the Bolivia event, the warmer slab resulted in a more ductile process with more deformation of the rock," Lay said.</p>
<p>The Sea of Okhotsk earthquake may have involved re-rupture of a fault in the plate produced when the oceanic plate bent down into the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone as it began to sink. But the precise mechanism for initiating shear fracture under huge confining pressure remains unclear. The presence of fluid can lubricate the fault, but all of the fluids should have been squeezed out of the slab before it reached that depth.</p>
<p>"If the fault slips just a little, the friction could melt the rock and that could provide the fluid, so you would get a runaway thermal effect. But you still have to get it to start sliding," Lay said. "Some transformation of mineral forms might give the initial kick, but we can't directly detect that.

<p>The teams from Europe, Australia, and New Zealand had corporate sponsors. Others had members that came from wealthy families with resources at the ready.</p>
<p>Not the American Youth Sailing Force, which had three members who are either current or former UC Santa Cruz students. This scrappy group of nine 19- to 24-year-olds needed to raise about $250,000 themselves in order to compete. So, the young sailors held auctions, networked, and learned how to make fundraising speeches. They slept on the floor of an office building while they trained, and lived off eggs and PBJ sandwiches.</p>
<p>Not only did team American Youth Sailing Force win the inaugural race of the four-day series but, by the third day, it was tied for first position. One bad race and high winds that cancelled the final event left the team with a fifth-place finish &#8212; just three points out of second.</p>
<p>"It was the most amazing sailing campaign I've ever been involved in," said 22-year-old Cooper Dressler (Oakes '13, Earth sciences) of the Americas-Cup-like event. "It was kind of a bucket-list thing that I didn't even realize I wanted, until I did it."</p>
<p>Dressler and his UCSC teammates &#8212;&#160;21-year-old Mikey Radziejowski (Merrill '14, history) and 22-year-old Tommy Pastalka, who graduated from UCSC with a degree in environmental studies &#8212; had lots of experience racing high-performance skiffs. But the Youth Americas Cup's AC45s were like something out of a James Bond movie. The high-tech catamarans carried a 72-foot wing sail &#8212; basically an upright airplane wing that can push the boat to speeds of 35 mph &#8212; and had a carbon fiber body that made them light and maneuverable.</p>
<p>"It's kind of like sitting on top of a car that's flying down a parkway," Dressler said of sailing the speedy vessels. "But the whole time the car is moving, you have to get up and do these jobs."</p>
<p>Because the AC45s require such precision and physical stamina to sail, Team American Youth Sailing Force spent four months of 12-hour days preparing for the race. Each day, they sailed the San Francisco Bay, held strategy sessions, and worked out at a nearby gym &#8212; sometimes fitting in two sessions of weight-lifting and cardiovascular conditioning.</p>
<p>"When you sail an AC45, especially when you race, it's kind of like doing a full sprint the whole time &#8212; except it's with your upper body," Dressler said. "You are constantly close to your maximum heart rate of 190 beats per minute. You're on the brink of exhaustion the whole time, but you have to make tactical decisions too."</p>
<p>According to Dressler and Radziejowski, the races were adrenalin-filled battles of timing and tactics. Seawater dashed over the hulls and the boat's underwater foils hummed almost to a scream as the crew worked the winches and adjusted the sails while trying to outmaneuver the competition.</p>
<p>Once, a member of the American Youth Sailing Force team fell off the boat mid-race, forcing the crew to instantly have to redistribute all its tasks. Another time, the boat snagged a race buoy, causing the craft to nearly stand up on its bow before the sailors brought it back under control.</p>
<p>"It was a huge group effort," said Radziejowski, who hopes to become a professional sailor some day. "All nine of us really got along well. We had fun and pushed each other. Everyone worked really hard and no one slacked. That was the biggest success of our team."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

14.<br/><br/>Titled <em>Sliver of a Full Moon</em>, the play documents the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, signed into law by President Obama on March 7, 2013. <br/><br/>The Act recognizes the inherent sovereignty in American Indian Nations to prosecute non-Indians who commit acts of domestic violence on Native lands.<br/><br/>&#8220;This is a wonderful opportunity for both our center and UCSC to have this type of involvement in national policy issues regarding American Indian issues,&#8221; Dunn noted. <br/><br/>The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), founded in 1944, is the oldest, largest, and most representative American Indian and Alaska Native organization serving the broad interests of tribal governments and communities.<br/><br/>&#8220;In participating with both NCAI and the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center, this will bring our American Indian Resource Center to a new level of national recognition and networking that we have not achieved until now,&#8221; Dunn added.<br/><br/>Dunn is a poet, playwright, and musician, as well as the author of two volumes of poetry,<em> Outfoxing Coyote</em> (2001) and<em> Echolocation:

She said that UCSC AIRC students will have the opportunity to contribute to that project in areas ranging from writing and editing to production.<br/><br/>Dunn will also be teaching a course on feminism and Native American literature at UCSC in the spring.<br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3c8f82ac8072704649da30c3196d94c2"><name>marcum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>John A.

<hr/>
<p><br/>John A. Marcum, international educator and renowned Africa scholar, died September 12 in Santa Cruz.&#160; The cause was complications following cancer surgery.&#160; He was 86 years old.<br/><br/>Marcum was part of a small but passionate group of activist-scholars who helped shape and chronicle American relations with Africa during the collapse of colonialism and the birth of independent Africa.&#160; His influence extended from academics and policy makers in Western capitals to emerging leaders of Africa&#8217;s pre-independence nationalist movements such as Patrice Lumumba and Eduardo Mondlane. He was also deeply involved in efforts to end apartheid in South Africa for more than three decades.<br/><br/>Marcum was one of the world&#8217;s foremost experts on Angola and Mozambique.&#160; When war broke out in Angola in 1961 Marcum traveled behind enemy lines with nationalist guerrillas to deliver medicines to villagers and soldiers.&#160; He is widely credited with writing &#8220;the bible&#8221; on the Angolan revolution. According to <em>The New York Review of Books</em>, when the first volume, <em>The Angolan Revolution: The Anatomy of an Explosion (1950-1962)</em>, was published in 1969, it &#8220;immediately became the main source for anyone trying seriously to understand Angolan nationalism, including Portuguese officials in Lisbon and revolutionaries in Angola.&#8221;&#160; At the time of his death he was completing the final edits on a history of the Mozambican revolution based on a trove of original documents and interview notes dating back to the late 1950s. <br/><br/>Marcum began his teaching career at Colgate University in the late 1950s. During the 1960 presidential campaign he advised candidate John Kennedy and traveled to the continent with Averell Harriman at Kennedy&#8217;s behest.&#160; In 1961, he moved to Lincoln University the first degree-granting historically black university in the U.S.&#160; There he worked with the newly installed Kennedy administration to create and then direct a training program for African refugees &#8211; many leading members of nationalist movements &#8211; fleeing from colonial conflict on the continent. He served as the president of the Africa Studies Association in 1975. <br/><br/>In 1972, Marcum joined the faculty of UC Santa Cruz as a professor of politics (1972-2007), and provost of Merrill College (1972-1977).&#160; He later served as academic vice chancellor (1979-1984).&#160; In 1990, he became director of the Education Abroad Program for the University of California system (1990-2007), a position that allowed him to promote his twin passions for internationalism and higher education.&#160; Later, he assumed the additional role of Associate Provost for International Academic Activities in the University of California, Office of the President (2001-2007). Under his leadership, the number of students studying abroad increased substantially, and UC partnered with leading universities in Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe to create new and more diverse opportunities for students to study, research and do overseas internships.&#160; Marcum returned to UC Santa Cruz as professor emeritus of politics in 2007.<br/><br/>Born in 1927 in San Jose and raised in Napa, Marcum earned a B.A. (1949) and Ph.D. (1955) from Stanford University and an M.A. from Columbia University (1951).&#160; He first became involved in sub-Saharan Africa after receiving a Fulbright scholarship and studying French colonial involvement in West Africa at the University of Paris, Institut d&#8217;Etudes Politiques (1952-1954) and later received a Ford Foundation fellowship to continue his studies and travel in Africa. <br/><br/>John Marcum is survived by his wife of 49 years, Gwen, and children, Andrea and her husband Dom Pietrangelo, Edmund and his wife Deeksha and daughter Jaya, and Arthur and his sons Jackson and Jasper. &#160;<br/><br/>A memorial celebration of his life will be held in Santa Cruz at a time and place to be announced.&#160; Contributions in John&#8217;s memory may be made to a charity of the donor&#8217;s choice.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3d07966b8072704649da30c317c58de5"><name>move-in-feature-story-2013</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Students flock to campus during move-in week </title><summary>New students and families flocked to UC Santa Cruz this week, getting to know the scenic campus and meeting roommates during move-in week.</summary><start-date>1379725200000</start-date><display-name>Move-in week 2013</display-name><path>/2013/09/move-in-feature-story-2013</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/09/move-in-feature-story-2013</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1379708409391</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1380055489762</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/09/images/move-in-201-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/09/images/move-in-201-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>move-in-201-350.jpg</name><display-name>move-in-201-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>52903</file-size><width>247</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/09/images/move-in-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/09/images/move-in-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>move-in-80.jpg</name><display-name>move-in-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>16932</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>A team of enthusiastic greeters helped new students find their way around campus and move into the residence halls.

<p>New students and their families flocked to UC Santa Cruz this week, bringing lava lamps, toiletries, enormous cartons of Sprite and Aquafina, and Rubbermaid containers large enough to contain an entire person.</p>
<p>It was all part of the annual move-in ritual at UCSC. About 4,300 new undergraduate students are expected when fall-quarter classes start up again on Thursday, September 26.</p>
<p>The move-in continues through Sunday, September 22. Expect to see more students making their way across campus, clutching boxes of toothpaste, Advil and Alka Seltzer, dozens of artificial roses to brighten up the rooms, and posters to cover up every inch of wall space.</p>
<p>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway was on hand &#8211; as she is every year &#8211; to greet students and help with the move-in. So was a small army of volunteers who made sure students boarded the correct shuttle buses. A few of the greeters held &#8220;welcome&#8221; banners, drawing waves and honks from every passing motorist.</p>
<p>Students moving into Oakes College over the weekend took advantage of a full menu of activities including a showing of the recent Pixar hit movie, &#8220;Monsters University,&#8221; an art party, and a &#8220;bonding" fire, featuring horchata and free s&#8217;mores.&#160; Others planned to embark on a night hike on campus, and take part in a walking tour of downtown Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Everywhere you looked at Oakes, emotional hellos and goodbyes were taking place. Parents &#8211; a large number of them whose children would be the first to attend a four-year university &#8211; wished them luck, while roommates met for the first time.</p>
<p>Caillan Bower, 18 &#8211; who is leaning toward majoring in sociology &#8211; brought her entire family for the big move-in, all the way from Lotus, in the Sierra foothills. This is a big deal for her, she said. Bower is not a big traveler. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been on a plane before,&#8221; she said. But she was glad to report that her room has a great view, and that her aunt lives just 20 minutes from campus</p>
<p>Guadalupe Munoz, 18, lives much closer, in Morgan Hill.&#160; Still, the occasion was dramatic for her and her family. She is the first in her family to attend a four-year university. While she admitted to being nervous about living away from home, she was also very excited. &#8220;I want to set a good example for my nephew,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Of the new undergraduate students, 3,300 will be new freshmen and 1,000 new junior-level transfers; with nearly 98 percent of transfer students coming directly from California's community colleges. Cabrillo College accounts for the largest number of transfer students with 144 joining the campus this fall.</p>
<p>Almost 40 percent of the 2013 freshman class will be comprised of students from ethnic backgrounds that have been traditionally underrepresented within the UC system &#8211; African-American/Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Hispanic ethnicities.The 39.8 percent is slightly higher than last fall's 39.2 percent, continuing an upward trend. Fall 2011's class included 33.9 percent of students from underrepresented groups.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3d5f8baa8072704649da30c3aa9f8528"><name>move-in-photos-2013</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Photos from move-in 2013</title><summary>Photos of new students and families as they get to know the scenic campus and meet roommates during move-in week.</summary><start-date>1379664000000</start-date><display-name>Move-in photos 2013</display-name><path>/2013/09/move-in-photos-2013</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/09/move-in-photos-2013</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1379714173799</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1380063460217</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/09/images/move-in-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/09/images/move-in-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>move-in-80.jpg</name><display-name>move-in-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>16932</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Photos by Carolyn Lagattuta</article-subhead><article-text><p>New students and their families arrive at UCSC on Friday morning to move into their rooms at Oakes College.</p>

(Photo by S. McCabe)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The May 2013 Camarillo Springs Fire in Ventura County burned the entire habitat of a federally listed threatened plant species, a succulent known as Verity's liveforever <i>(Dudleya verityi).</i> Stephen McCabe, research director at the <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">UC Santa Cruz Arboretum</a>, has been working with National Park Service ecologist John Tiszler to study the plants and their potential for recovery in the aftermath of the fire.</p>
<p>In some areas where the succulents once grew, the fire was so hot that no plants could be found, according to McCabe and Tiszler. At other sites, the percentage of plants that appears to have survived is very small. In one area where 1,500 plants were counted in 2009, only 10 appeared un-scorched.</p>
<p>Because these plants can appear alive for awhile after their roots have been killed, researchers are hesitant to conclusively assess all the damage until after the first heavy fall rains. The fire occurred during the flowering period for these plants, but very few flowers have been seen since the fire on any of the Verity's liveforevers, so there might have been very little seed set this year.</p>
<p>While experts prefer to see a threatened species survive on its own, in this case the Verity's liveforever may need some help. Seed collected from garden-grown plants at the UCSC Arboretum could potentially be used to help restore the wild populations. No decisions have been made yet, however, about the best ways to facilitate the recovery.</p>
<p>Verity&#8217;s liveforever is only known from six reported occurrences in the western Santa Monica Mountains. It is listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, in part due to the potential loss to quarrying, housing development, fire, and collecting. Air pollution, non-native weeds, and trampling of habitat during recreational use may also be threats.</p>
<p>There is often debate about whether or not chance events could really have an effect on an endangered species that has more than one occurrence. Unfortunately, this is a case where a single event has adversely affected an entire species, McCabe said.&#160;</p>
<p>The Springs fire started along Highway 101 and within several hours had burned the entire 5,000-acre area over which the <i>Dudleya</i> populations are dispersed. The fire ultimately burned 24,000 acres over three days. Like almost all fires in the Santa Monica Mountains, it was a manmade fire, started by an automobile. Its occurrence during the spring growth and flowering period, rather than the late summer dormancy period, was unusual.&#160;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some climate-change models predict that conditions for such early fires will become more common. At the same time, increasing human populations make additional fire starts inevitable. The proximity to urbanization of all six occurrences of Verity's liveforever makes it likely that there will be damaging fires in the future.</p>
<p>Fire experts and public agencies remind the public to be especially careful not to start fires in a dry year like this one. They also emphasize the need for interagency cooperation to protect and restore endangered species that grow on a mix of different public and private lands.</p>
<p>The Arboretum maintains back-up collections for many species from around the world for events just such as this and encourages people to help the wild populations survive.</p>
<p>The UCSC Arboretum relies on gifts, memberships, and gift shop sales to pay for salaries, plants, supplies, and technology. The Arboretum is open every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. More information is available online at<a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu"> arboretum.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>

This framework for studying and treating cancer has made sense for generations, but molecular analysis now shows that cancers of different organs have many shared features, while cancers from the same organ or tissue are often quite distinct.</p>
<p>The Pan-Cancer Initiative, a major effort to analyze the molecular aberrations in cancer cells across a range of tumor types, has yielded an abundance of new findings reported in 18 forthcoming papers, including four published in the October issue of <i>Nature Genetics</i>. The initiative, launched in October 2012 at a meeting in Santa Cruz, California, is part of <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)</a> project led by the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute.</p>
<p>Josh Stuart, professor of biomolecular engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, helped organize the Pan-Cancer Initiative and is lead author of a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.2764">commentary in <i>Nature Genetics</i></a> giving an overview of the project and its initial findings.</p>
<p>"For years we've been looking at one tumor type at a time, but there are patterns you can only spot by making connections across different tissues and tumor types. Finding these similarities across tissues can have important implications for treatment," Stuart said.</p>
<p>For example, some types of bladder cancer look very similar to certain lung and head-and-neck cancers, and recognizing those similarities may open up new therapeutic options. "This could allow oncologists to apply all they know about treating head-and-neck squamous cell tumors to the ten percent of bladder cancers that have the same characteristics," Stuart said.</p>
<p>TCGA is generating comprehensive maps of the key genomic changes in major types and subtypes of cancer, eventually covering at least 20 different cancer types. TCGA researchers are profiling thousands of tumors to discover molecular aberrations at the DNA, RNA, protein, and epigenetic levels. The Pan-Cancer Initiative has done comparative analyses of the first 12 tumor types profiled by TCGA.</p>
<p>The analyses show that the tissue of origin is an important factor, producing a dominant signal that groups tumors mostly according to their tissue of origin. But the data also reveal a number of interesting signals that cut across tumor types and suggest new ways of categorizing tumors, Stuart said. In addition, the statistical power gained by combining all of the data available from different tumor types has enabled researchers to see new patterns of genomic aberrations.</p>
<p>"In ovarian cancer, for example, we were able to identify mutations that correlate with the response to treatment, but only by using data from other types of cancer," Stuart said.</p>
<p>A persistent problem in cancer genomics has been distinguishing "driver" mutations from "passenger" mutations. Cancer cells often accumulate large numbers of genetic mutations that do not play a role in driving the uncontrolled cell growth that is a hallmark of cancer. These passenger mutations greatly complicate efforts to identify the genomic drivers of cancer. Aggregating data from the 12 tumor types gave Pan-Cancer researchers enough statistical power to see patterns that weren't apparent before. One of the forthcoming papers identifies with high confidence many new genomic drivers of cancer, Stuart said.</p>
<p>The Pan-Cancer analyses have also revealed the importance of new classes of mutations, such as those that affect how a cell's DNA is packaged in the chromosomes. As cells differentiate into specialized cell types during an organism's development, some genes are turned off and others are turned on depending on how the DNA is packaged together with specialized proteins to make "chromatin." Genomic changes (gene amplification, deletion or mutation) affecting genes that control the packaging of DNA can disrupt this key regulatory mechanism. One of the <i>Nature Genetics</i> papers (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.2760">Zack et al.</a>) analyzed amplifications and deletions and found 104 novel regions that had not been associated with cancer previously, and these regions contain a rich supply of genes involved in "epigenetic" modifications of chromatin.</p>
<p>"There are so many different ways to mess up the packaging of DNA that the mutations look random in any one tumor type, but now we have enough data to see that chromatin remodeling is a big factor in a lot of these tumors," Stuart said.</p>
<p>Stuart played a central role in creating the organizational framework that made the Pan-Cancer analyses possible. The project started as an informal collaboration among members of the TCGA research network, but then quickly expanded to include many other interested researchers. Coordinating all these efforts was a major task. Stuart worked with the bioinformatics company Sage Bionetworks to create a data repository called Synapse for the project. To ensure that everyone was working from the same data set, a data "freeze" was established in December 2012. But Stuart realized that many important analyses would depend on the results of other analyses carried out by different research groups.</p>
<p>"The interdependencies are so complicated that everybody had to abide by a schedule in order to play the game," Stuart said. "The system worked really well, and the project has ballooned because there are so many interesting things to look at. We have 18 papers coming out in this first release, and there are 60 more Pan-Cancer papers coming that I'm currently tracking."</p>
<p>The Synapse system created by Sage Bionetworks is described in one of the <i>Nature Genetics</i> papers (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.2761">Omberg et al.</a>). "This beautifully organized data repository is now available for scientists around the world to use to go beyond these initial analyses and discover even more about cancer," Stuart said.</p>
<p>Researchers will continue to use the framework and procedures Stuart established as they integrate new tumor types and new data from TCGA, as well as data from other cancer genomics projects. Stuart has just been named, along with Gad Getz of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, to lead an international pan-cancer initiative that will combine TCGA data with data from other cancer genomics efforts around the world.</p>
<p>The hope is that these cross-tumor investigations will lead to new and improved cancer treatments. One goal is to identify biomarkers that can be used across a range of tumor types to indicate which therapies are likely to be most effective. The results of these studies may also point toward targets for novel therapeutic agents that can be tested clinically.</p>
<p>"These initial papers are just the first step, and we expect much more to come from the Pan-Cancer Initiative," Stuart said. "With the infrastructure now in place, we can scale up to look at more types of data, especially whole genome sequencing data, and to include many more tumor types, including rare tumors."</p>

<p>On Tuesday, October 8, UCSC's&#160;Institute of the Arts and Sciences will present the campus&#8217;s inaugural LASER event, hosting an evening of speakers who will lay the foundation for a new UCSC series by speaking about the intertwining of art and science.</p>
<p>John Weber, founding director of the Institute, noted that the main themes of the event--such as "why art and science" and "why now"--will provide context to show how the new series will serve as a local forum for presenting art and science projects underway throughout the University of California, in the Bay Area, and beyond.</p>
<p>Titled <em>Exploring the Frontiers of Knowledge and Imagination</em>, the October 8 event will take place at UCSC&#8217;s Digital Arts and Research Center (DARC) in Room 108, beginning at 6:45 p.m.</p>
<p>&#160;Participants will include:</p>
<p>&#160;&#8226; <strong>Piero Scaruffi</strong>&#8212;founder of the Leonardo Art/Science Evenings (LASERS), cognitive scientist, author, and cultural historian. <strong><em>Topic: &#8220;A Brief History of Creativity from Cheops Pyramid to Silicon Valley: 5000 years of Art/Science Misunderstandings.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>&#8226;<strong> Ken Goldberg</strong>&#8212;professor of New Media at UC Berkeley, where he and his students investigate robotics, art, and social media. <strong><em>Topic: &#8220;Sensitivity Analysis: Arts, Robots, and Nature."</em></strong></p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Jennifer Gonzalez</strong>&#8212;professor in the History of Art and Visual Culture Department at UCSC, and at the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program in New York, she writes about contemporary art with an emphasis on installation art, digital art, and activist art. <em><strong>Topic: &#8220;Artists Interrogating Democracy.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Greg Laughlin</strong>: professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at UCSC, he works on the detection and characterization of planets orbiting nearby stars. <em><strong>Topic: &#8220;The Three Body Problem (No Longer a Proof Walking on Stilts).&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Gail Wight</strong>: professor of experimental media art at Stanford University, with a focus on issues of biology and the cultural impact of science and technology. <strong><em>Topic: &#8220;Scenic Overlook.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Leonardo is a long-established, international organization devoted to furthering dialogue and work in the arts and sciences, and our talks will be publicized both regionally and nationally through their network,&#8221; said Weber.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a way to get people together who might otherwise not meet, create connections, and lay the seeds for future collaborations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weber added that future LASER events at UCSC will deliberately mix speakers from on and off campus and will feature work from a variety of different fields.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are inviting some speakers working in areas we are particularly interested in, such as health and water, and we are also paying attention to fields that UCSC is particularly strong in, such as astronomy, said Weber.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beyond that, we will simply be working to identify really intriguing research happening here and elsewhere, as well as good speakers.&#8221; <br/><br/>Future LASER events at UCSC are scheduled for November, 5, January 28, February 25, April 8, and May 6. Speakers TBA.</p>

of his work</article-subhead><article-text><p><em>Formal Complexity</em>, a new exhibition at the Sesnon Gallery, highlights UCSC&#8217;s permanent collection of figurative works by the late artist Charles Griffin Farr (1908-1997). <br/><br/>A painter in the American Realist tradition, Farr&#8217;s influences range from classical Renaissance through 17th century Dutch painting, to contemporary ideas of visual perception. <br/><br/>His work can be found in the collections of the National Museum of American Art, Washington D.C.; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Oakland Museum of California; Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento--and at UC Santa Cruz. <br/><br/>&#8220;After his death, Mr. Farr gifted many paintings and drawings to UCSC, some of which are also on display at the University Center,&#8221; noted Sesnon Gallery director Shelby Graham.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dynamic group of paintings at our exhibition represents the full spectrum of his artistic career,&#8221; she added. &#8220;A few special surprise loans are also on view.&#8221;<br/><br/>Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Farr studied in New York City and at the Academie Americaine in Paris. He moved west after World War II and taught at the San Francisco Art Institute.</p>
<p>Farr also became renowned in San Francisco for the figure drawing sessions he held in his studio on Potrero Hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farr has long been recognized for helping to preserve the Potrero Hill Library by organizing a group exhibition with his students starting in 1958, which continues today as the oldest annual art show in San Francisco,"&#160;Graham noted. "It owes its longevity to a group of artists who painted with, or were under the tutelage, of Farr.&#8221;</p>
<p>Graham said that the gallery will host a free public reception on October 9 from 5 to 7 p.m. that will feature stories about Farr and the creative neighborhood of Potrero Hill in San Francisco.</p>
<p>She added that in conjunction with the exhibition, free figure drawing events will also take place throughout the month of October at the Sesnon.</p>

I want to extend a special welcome to all our new students, including 3,300 frosh and 1,100 transfer students. I'm happy you've joined us, and I want you to know this campus is committed to your success. <br/><br/>This is going to be a good year. Students won't face a tuition increase, and UC's budget picture is finally stabilizing. This is also a pivotal moment for the campus, and I am focused on promoting UCSC's distinctive character and achievements on the national stage.<br/><br/>I want you also to be aware of four important initiatives regarding sustainability, strategic planning, fundraising, and promotion:<br/><br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;For years, UCSC students have taken the lead on campus sustainability efforts, and I am happy to support their work this year by launching the <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/get-involved/challenge/index.html">Chancellor's Sustainability Challenge</a>. My goal is to move us closer to becoming a "zero waste" campus by reducing the amount of trash that goes to the landfill. You'll hear more about this soon.<br/><br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Strategic planning is a focused, campuswide effort that will shape the future of UCSC, building on our strengths and positioning us to increase our impact. Everyone will have an opportunity to participate, and I hope you will. You'll hear more about this key effort soon, too.<br/><br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Fundraising is going to be a top priority this year. UCSC is a university like no other, and philanthropic support will be key to our ability to realize our ambitions. I look forward to sharing our story more broadly as we seek private funds to support the people, programs, research, and facilities that make this place special.<br/><br/>&#8226;&#160;&#160; &#160;Over the summer, Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway and I worked with alumni, Foundation trustees, and others to capture the essence of UCSC in a bold <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/features/original/poster.html">advertisement</a> that debuts today in the first of four national publications. This ad speaks to UCSC's core identity as a place with an unshakable commitment to students and to the fearless, bold inquiry that propels pathbreaking research. Our students learn how to think, not what to think. We care about social justice and the health of our planet. These qualities define UCSC's distinctive culture, and these ads are part of an overarching campus strategy to raise awareness and build our national profile in an era when fundraising is more important than ever. Check it out and let me know what you think. <br/><br/>Write to me at chancellor@ucsc.edu. And again, best wishes to all our new and returning Banana Slugs!<br/><br/></p>

<p>30 de septiembre de 2013<br/><br/>Encargadas y encargados de unidad: Por favor env&#237;en o entreguen una copia de este mensaje en su &#225;rea para las personas que no tienen acceso regular a una computadora.<br/><br/>Para: la comunidad de la Universidad de California en Santa Cruz<br/>De parte de: Chancellor Blumenthal<br/>Sobre: Bienvenidas y bienvenidos al trimestre del oto&#241;o<br/><br/>&#161;Bienvenidas y bienvenidos al trimestre del oto&#241;o! Quiero dar una especial bienvenida a todas nuestras estudiantes nuevas y a todos nuestros estudiantes nuevos, incluyendo a 3.300 frosh (estudiantes de primer a&#241;o) y 1.100 estudiantes de transferencia. Me alegra mucho de que est&#233;n con nosotras/os y quiero que sepan que este campus est&#225; comprometido con el &#233;xito de ustedes.<br/><br/>Este va a ser un buen a&#241;o. Las y los estudiantes no se enfrentar&#225;n con un aumento de matr&#237;cula y el cuadro del presupuesto de la UC finalmente est&#225; estabiliz&#225;ndose. Este es tambi&#233;n un momento crucial para el campus, y estoy enfocado en promover el car&#225;cter &#250;nico y los logros distintivos de la UCSC en la esfera nacional.<br/><br/>Quiero tambi&#233;n que est&#233;n al tanto de cuatro iniciativas importantes en materia de sostenibilidad, planificaci&#243;n estrat&#233;gica, recaudaci&#243;n de fondos y promoci&#243;n:</p>
<p>&#8226; Durante a&#241;os, las y los estudiantes de la UCSC han tomado la delantera en los esfuerzos de sostenibilidad del campus, y estoy contento de apoyar el trabajo este a&#241;o con el lanzamiento del Desaf&#237;o del Chancellor para la Sostenibilidad (<a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/get-involved/challenge/index.html">Chancellor&#8217;s Sustainability Challenge</a>). Mi objetivo es llegar m&#225;s cerca a convertirnos en un campus &#8220;cero residuos&#8221;, al reducir la cantidad de basura que va al vertedero. Ustedes pronto oir&#225;n m&#225;s sobre esto.<br/><br/>&#8226; La planificaci&#243;n estrat&#233;gica es un esfuerzo centrado, de todo el campus, que le dar&#225; forma al futuro de la UCSC, aprovechando nuestras fuerzas y posicion&#225;ndonos para aumentar nuestro impacto. Todas y todos tendr&#225;n la oportunidad de participar y espero que lo hagan. Ustedes pronto va a oir m&#225;s tambi&#233;n sobre este esfuerzo.</p>
<p>&#8226; La recaudaci&#243;n de fondos va a ser una prioridad m&#225;xima este a&#241;o. La UCSC es una universidad como ninguna otra, y el apoyo filantr&#243;pico ser&#225; clave para nuestra capacidad de hacer realidad nuestras aspiraciones. Espero poder compartir nuestra historia de manera m&#225;s amplia a medida que buscamos fondos privados para apoyar a las personas, programas, investigaci&#243;n y servicios que hacen que este lugar sea especial.</p>
<p>&#8226; Durante el verano, Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway y yo trabajamos con las/os ex alumnas/os, las/os fideicomisarias/os de la Fundaci&#243;n y otras personas para captar la esencia de la UCSC en un anuncio audaz (<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/features/original/poster.html">advertisement</a>) que aparece hoy en la&#160; primera de cuatro publicaciones nacionales. Este anuncio se refiere a la identidad central de la UCSC como un lugar con un compromiso inquebrantable con las/os estudiantes y con la valiente, audaz capacidad inquisitiva que impulsa la investigaci&#243;n pionera. Nuestras/os estudiantes aprenden c&#243;mo pensar, no qu&#233; pensar. Nos preocupamos por la justicia social y la salud de nuestro planeta. Estas cualidades definen la cultura distintiva de la UCSC, y estos anuncios son parte de una estrategia integral del campus para crear conciencia y construir nuestro perfil nacional, en una &#233;poca en que la recaudaci&#243;n de fondos es m&#225;s importante que nunca. Compru&#233;benlo ustedes mismas/os y h&#225;ganme saber lo que piensan.<br/><br/>Escr&#237;banme a chancellor@ucsc.edu. Y de nuevo, &#161;mis mejores deseos para todas nuestras nuevas y todos nuestros nuevos Banana Slugs y para las y los Banana Slugs que regresan!<br/><br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6fe0bce28072704649da30c3a736d13f"><name>beware-of-scams</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Beware of Scams</title><summary>With the beginning of the academic year, the Police Department and Information Technology Services want to take this opportunity to remind you to beware of scams.</summary><start-date>1380528000000</start-date><display-name>Beware of Scams</display-name><path>/2013/09/beware-of-scams</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/09/beware-of-scams</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1380561501337</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1380561501337</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">With the beginning of the academic year, the Police Department and Information Technology Services want to take this opportunity to remind you to beware of scams.<br/> <br/> Unscrupulous people are constantly coming up with scams designed to trick you.

<p>The planet is marked by high clouds in the west and clear skies in the east. Previous studies from Spitzer have resulted in temperature maps of planets orbiting other stars, but this is the first look at cloud structures on a distant world.</p>
<p>"These clouds may well be composed of rock and iron, since the planet is over 1000 degrees Fahrenheit," said Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and coauthor of a paper on the findings that has been accepted for publication in the <i>Astrophysical Journal Letters</i>. Fortney is a member of the Kepler science team.</p>
<p>Brice-Olivier Demory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is lead author of the paper. "By observing this planet with Spitzer and Kepler for more than three years, we were able to produce a very low-resolution 'map' of this giant, gaseous planet," Demory said. "We wouldn't expect to see oceans or continents on this type of world, but we detected a clear, reflective signature that we interpreted as clouds."</p>
<p>Kepler has discovered more than 150 exoplanets, which are planets outside our solar system, and Kepler-7b was one of the first. The telescope's problematic reaction wheels prevent it from hunting planets any more, but astronomers continue to pore over almost four years' worth of collected data.</p>
<p>Kepler's visible-light observations of Kepler-7b's moon-like phases led to a rough map of the planet that showed a bright spot on its western hemisphere. But these data were not enough on their own to decipher whether the bright spot was coming from clouds or heat. The Spitzer Space Telescope played a crucial role in answering this question.</p>
<p>Like Kepler, Spitzer can fix its gaze at a star system as a planet orbits around the star, gathering clues about the planet's atmosphere. Spitzer's ability to detect infrared light means it was able to measure Kepler-7b's temperature, estimating it between 1,500 and 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (1,100 to 1,300 Kelvin). This is relatively cool for a planet that orbits so close to its star--within 0.6 astronomical units--and, according to astronomers, too cool to be the source of light Kepler observed. Instead, they determined, light from the planet's star is bouncing off cloud tops located on the west side of the planet.</p>
<p>"Kepler-7b reflects much more light than most giant planets we've found, which we attribute to clouds in the upper atmosphere," said Thomas Barclay, Kepler scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center. "Unlike those on Earth, the cloud patterns on this planet do not seem to change much over time--it has a remarkably stable climate."</p>
<p>The findings are an early step toward using similar techniques to study the atmospheres of planets more like Earth in composition and size.</p>
<p>"With Spitzer and Kepler together, we have a multi-wavelength tool for getting a good look at planets that are trillions of miles away," said Paul Hertz, director of NASA&#8217;s Astrophysics Division in Washington. "We're at a point now in exoplanet science where we are moving beyond just detecting exoplanets, and into the exciting science of understanding them."</p>
<p>Kepler identified planets by watching for dips in starlight that occur as the planets transit, or pass in front of their stars, blocking the light. This technique and other observations of Kepler-7b previously revealed that it is one of the puffiest planets known: if it could somehow be placed in a tub of water, it would float. The planet was also found to whip around its star in just less than five days.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="855af85b8072704649da30c3e104b3f6"><name>cover-crop-workshop</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cover crop workshop covers how to protect and improve your soil</title><summary>Gardeners, don’t put away your spade and fork just yet.

<p>On Saturday, October 12 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., Martin will share his enthusiasm for these soil-building crops at a workshop on &#8220;Choosing and Using Cover Crops in the Home Garden and Orchard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cover crops, often referred to as &#8220;green manures,&#8221; are crops such as bell beans and oat grass that are planted in the fall and grown over the winter, then either worked into the soil in the spring to decompose before spring and summer planting, or harvested for compost.</p>
<p>Martin will discuss the cover crop species best suited to the Central Coast, along with how much seed you&#8217;ll need for your garden or tree crops, and how best to time cover crop plantings in the fall and &#8220;plough downs&#8221; in the spring. Workshop participants will get a chance to practice planting cover crops in the garden beds and orchards at the Chadwick Garden.&#160;</p>
<p>Cost of the cover crop workshop is $30 for the general public, $20 for Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden members, and $5 for UCSC students. Memberships are available at the workshop. Register online at&#160;<a href="http://covercrops.bpt.me/">http://covercrops.bpt.me</a>, or pay at the door with cash or check.</p>
