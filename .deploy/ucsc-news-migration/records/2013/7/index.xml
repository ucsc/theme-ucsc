These behavioral changes may cause them to alter diving behavior or temporarily avoid important feeding areas, according to experiments conducted by an international team of marine scientists.</p>
<p>The Southern California Behavioral Response Study (SoCal-BRS) exposed tagged blue whales in the California Bight to simulated mid-frequency (3.5-4 kHz) sonar sounds at several orders of magnitude lower power than the military uses.</p>
<p>Animal-borne tags attached with non-invasive suction cups recorded acoustic data and high-resolution animal movements as the animals were exposed to the controlled sounds. The tags enabled researchers to see that some of the whales that had been engaged in deep feeding stopped eating and either sped up or moved away from the source of the noise.</p>
<p>"The tag technology we use offers a unique glimpse into the underwater behavior of whales that otherwise would not be possible," said Ari Friedlaender, a research scientist at the Duke Marine Laboratory and an adjunct researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC).</p>
<p>The study, which was funded by the U.S. Navy Chief of Naval Operations Environmental Readiness Division and the U.S. Office of Naval Research, appears July 3 in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society - B.</em></p>
<p>Not all the whales responded to the noise, and not all responded in the same way.</p>
<p>"Whales clearly respond in some conditions by modifying diving behavior and temporarily avoiding areas where sounds were produced," said lead author Jeremy Goldbogen of Cascadia Research. "But overall the responses are complex and depend on a number of interacting factors," including whether or not they were feeding and, if they were feeding, how deep they were.</p>
<p>John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research, one of the project's lead investigators, noted that blue whales are the largest animal that has ever lived and their populations globally remain at a fraction of their former numbers prior to whaling. "They appear regularly off the southern California coast, where they feed. But that area of the ocean is also the site of military training and testing exercises that involve loud mid-frequency sonar signals," he said. "Such sonar exercises have been associated with several unusual strandings of other marine mammal species (typically beaked whales) in the past. Until this study, almost no information was available about whether and how blue whales respond to sonar."</p>
<p>The SoCal-BRS chief scientist is Brandon Southall, president of SEA, Inc., and an adjunct researcher at both UC Santa Cruz and Duke University. "These are the first direct measurements of individual responses for any baleen whale species to these kinds of mid-frequency sonar signals," he said. "These findings help us better understand risks to these animals from human sound and inform timely conservation and management decisions."</p>
<p>A related paper published by this research team in the journal <em>Biology Letters</em> has shown clear and even stronger responses of Cuvier's beaked whales to simulated mid-frequency sonar exposures at much lower sound exposure levels than expected. Beaked whales showed a variety of responses to both actual military sonar in the distance and nearby simulated sonar. What the beaked whales were doing at the time appeared to be a key factor affecting their reactions.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1765/20130657</url><title>Study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a5760638807270463215b74b749f3cdf"><name>irion-nat-geo-cover</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cover coup</title><summary>A childhood dream of gracing the cover of National Geographic comes true for Rob Irion.</summary><keywords>National Geographic, Rob Irion, UCSC Science Communication Program, chaos</keywords><start-date>1372838400000</start-date><display-name>Cover coup</display-name><path>/2013/07/irion-nat-geo-cover</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/07/irion-nat-geo-cover</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1372870542854</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1515104157372</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value><value>Science Communication Program</value><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/07/images/Irion Rob.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/07/images/Irion Rob.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Irion Rob.jpg</name><display-name>Irion Rob.jpg</display-name><file-size>63867</file-size><width>300</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt>Rob Irion</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/07/images/NatGeo cover thumb.png</path><link>site://news/2013/07/images/NatGeo cover thumb.png</link><site>news</site><name>NatGeo cover thumb.png</name><display-name>NatGeo cover thumb.png</display-name><file-size>16201</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Rob Irion National Geographic cover</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Rob Irion (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/07/images/NatGeo cover.png</path><link>site://news/2013/07/images/NatGeo cover.png</link><site>news</site><name>NatGeo cover.png</name><display-name>NatGeo cover.png</display-name><file-size>112110</file-size><width>300</width><height>204</height></image><image-alt>National Geographic cover</image-alt><image-caption>The July 2013 issue of <em>National Geographic</em> featuring Irion's cover story</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>A childhood dream of gracing the cover of National Geographic comes true for Rob Irion</article-subhead><article-text><p>As a kid growing up in Vermont, Rob Irion would snuggle into his father's recliner and pore through the pages of <em>National Geographic</em> magazine. He'd marvel at stories of exploration and scientific achievement, and dream that, one day, he'd see his own name on the cover of the venerable magazine.</p>
<p>Forty years later, Irion's dream came true. The director of UC Santa Cruz's Science Communication Program saw his 18-page <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/125-solar-system/irion-text">article on the violent origins of our solar system</a> grace the cover of this month's <em>National Geographic.</em></p>
<p>It's an achievement Irion &#8212; who has penned stories for <em>Discover, Smithsonian, New Scientist,</em> and <em>Sky &amp; Telescope</em> magazines, among others &#8212; calls the pinnacle of his career and a story that was a decade in the making.</p>
<p>Irion began his life's work with a bachelor's degree in Earth and planetary sciences at MIT and plans to get a Ph.D. in astrophysics. But his love of writing soon drew him toward journalism and a reporting job at two small Boston-area newspapers: the <em>North Reading Transcript</em> and the <em>Lynnfield Villager</em>.</p>
<p>There, Irion honed his skills on stories of town meetings, high school basketball games &#8212; and one play review that drew the ire of a local mom who bristled when Irion noted her daughter seemed a little too aware of her surroundings in her role as the blind Helen Keller.</p>
<p>Moving to California in 1987, Irion studied under John Wilkes in UCSC's Science Communication Program. After nine years as the science writer for UCSC's campus news office, he soon began filling his portfolio with magazine articles &#8212; stories of galaxies, asteroids, and the universe.</p>
<p>But a trip to Barrow, Alaska, where Irion strapped on a bear rifle and rode toboggans over the rough ice for a <em>Discover</em> magazine story about scientists exploring the possibility of life on Jupiter's icy moon Europa, focused his attention on our solar system. <em>Smithsonian</em> articles on planets and hazardous near-Earth objects followed.</p>
<p>"It began to gel in my mind that our concept of the solar system as a familiar, unchanging place was not correct," says the 49-year-old. "Early in its history, it actually was a very changeable, violent, and unstable place."</p>
<p>Pitching that story of our solar system's wild birth and adolescence to editors at <em>National Geographic,</em> Irion was given the go-ahead for a story that would lead him to a close encounter with the very beginnings of life &#8212; a 4.55 billion-year-old dust particle snagged from a comet by the NASA spacecraft Stardust.</p>
<p>Examining that speck through a University of Washington electron microscope gave Irion chills. "It's rare you get to stare at your own origins," he says.</p>
<p>The finished article &#8212; which was crafted with the help of UCSC Astronomy Department Chair Greg Laughlin and <em>National Geographic</em> senior editor Rob Kunzig, and includes stunning illustrations by space artist Dana Berry &#8212; took two-and-a-half years from pitch to publication. But, notes Irion, it was actually a decade of research and writing that led him to it &#8212; a fact he impresses on his UCSC students.</p>
<p>Science writing is not always quick or easy.</p>
<p>It is a lesson Sci-Comm's 300 graduates have taken to heart as they move through a rigorous series of newspaper, online news and university internships that are at the heart of the program. With alumni like <em>National Geographic'</em>s Jane Lee and the entire science-writing staff of Wired.com in San Francisco, the program has nearly a 100 percent success rate of students working in the business, according to Irion.</p>
<p>So why spend years researching and writing about science?</p>
<p>"Because it fosters a sense of wonder in people," says Irion. "And that's worth something."</p>

<br/>
Titled <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/holocaust"><em><strong>The Holocaust</strong></em></a>, the course traces the destruction of the Jews and Jewish life in Europe by Nazi Germany, drawing on major works of history, literature, and film.<br/>
<br/>
It explores not only the destruction of European Jewry, but also the shifting historical conditions from which the Holocaust emerged.</p>
<p>Students taking the 10-week class will study memoirs, historical documents, poetry, documentary footage, films, novels, and other media that help to illustrate the variety of human experience during this important historical episode.</p>
<p>It is designed to provide participants with an expanded knowledge and understanding of Eastern and Western Jewish communities, the origins and development of anti-Semitism, the formation and operation of concentration camps, resistance movements, and the Holocaust as a problem for world history.</p>
<p>The course will be taught by professors Murray Baumgarten and Peter Kenez, based on their acclaimed UC Santa Cruz class that regularly draws more than 300 students each year. The course is supported by UCSC&#8217;s Neufeld-Levin Chair in Holocaust studies.</p>
<p>Baumgarten (B.A. Columbia, Ph.D. Berkeley) is a distinguished professor of English &amp; contemporary literature, co-director of Jewish Studies, and founding director of The Dickens Project at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
He has published books and articles on modern Jewish and English writing, as well as original fiction and translation. Baumgarten&#8217;s recent work has focused on the Jews of Venice and the afterlife of the Ghetto. He is the recipient of a campus award for excellence in teaching.</p>
<p>Kenez is a professor emeritus in the History Department at UC Santa Cruz and a founding faculty member of UCSC's Stevenson College. Kenez is a native of Hungary and a Holocaust survivor. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University and has been teaching Russian and modern European history at UCSC since 1966.</p>
<p>Kenez is the author of eight books, including <em>A History of the Soviet Union from the Beginning to the End</em> and the autobiographical <em>Varieties of Fear: Growing Up Jewish Under Nazism and Communism</em>. His most recent work is titled <em>From Antisemitism to Genocide; the Origins of the Holocaust.</em></p>

<br/>
This award was established in 1997 to recognize teachers who have contributed to and encouraged the study of anthropology. The successful teaching of anthropology is at the core of producing successful anthropologists, the anthropology association states. The award will be presented at the AAA's annual meeting in Chicago in November.<br/>
<br/>
"This is an incredible honor and so richly deserved," said anthropology department chair Danilyn Rutherford.<br/>
<br/>
"Professor Pandey is a charismatic and beloved teacher whose courses are incredibly popular and consistently receive rave reviews in formal evaluations submitted by students," Rutherford wrote in a nominating letter. "In these documents, students often note that he is the very best teacher that they have ever had and that he represents all that a university professor should be."<br/>
<br/>
UCSC's anthropology department files indicate Pandey has taught nearly 5,000 undergraduates in more than 300 courses since he joined the faculty in 1973. More than two dozen alumni submitted letters of support adding to a trove of unsolicited letters received over the years.<br/>
<br/>
Several of the writers noted that they were inspired to enter the field of anthropology because of his classes.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Pandey won a Chancellor&#8217;s Achievement Award for Diversity. In 2005, he won the UCSC Division of Social Sciences Distinguished Teaching Award, known as the "Golden Apple Award."<br/>
<br/>
Last year, he won the Mahatma Gandhi Pravasi Medal give by the NRI Welfare Society of India to recognize outstanding services and achievements by Indians in the international arena.<br/>
<br/>
Pandey's areas of research include the religion and politics of the Pueblo Indians of the American southwest and the tribal peoples of Himalayan Terai and northeast India. He has done fieldwork among the Zuni, Hopi, and the Navajo in the southwest, and more recently among the Tharus of India and Nepal, and among the Khasi, Garo, and Naga in&#160; northeastern India.<br/>
<br/>
"Professor Pandey is an extraordinary teacher for all the right reasons," Rutherford wrote. "He loves his subject matter and genuinely cares about his students and what they learn. We agree with one of his students who described him as 'a jewel of the campus.' We would go further &#8211; he&#8217;s a jewel of the discipline."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c4db0db7807270463215b74b108f07cb"><name>teaching-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus honors 'best of the best' with year-end teaching awards</title><summary>Seven faculty members from UCSC received the 2012-13 Excellence in Teaching Awards during a recent campus ceremony.</summary><keywords>UC Santa Cruz, Excellence in Teaching Awards, 2012-13, Academic Senate</keywords><start-date>1373356800000</start-date><display-name>Distinguished teachers</display-name><path>/2013/07/teaching-awards</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/07/teaching-awards</link><created-by>jrburns</created-by><created-on>1373397257580</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1373583482685</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/07/images/teaching-awards.536.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/07/images/teaching-awards.536.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>teaching-awards.536.jpg</name><file-size>216560</file-size><width>536</width><height>325</height></image><image-alt>Photo of teaching award recipients</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/07/images/teaching-awards.72.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/07/images/teaching-awards.72.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>teaching-awards.72.jpg</name><display-name>teaching-awards.72.jpg</display-name><file-size>18078</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Illustration of apple and book</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Committee on Teaching chair Charlie McDowell (fourth from left) and Chancellor Blumenthal are flanked by UCSC's 2012-13 Excellence in Teaching Award recipients: (l&#8211;r) Susan Strome, Lindsay Knisely, Vilashini Cooppan, Stefano Profumo, Raoul Birnbaum, Shelly Grabe, and Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz.

At the end of the academic year, seven teachers were recognized for inspiring students with a passion that comes straight from the heart.</p>
<p>This year's recipients work across the disciplines, from literature to physics, united by a willingness to experiment and challenge themselves in pursuit of excellence. As Chancellor George Blumenthal told this year's recipients during a recent reception to present the 2013 awards, "Excellent teaching is a core value at UC Santa Cruz. It's central to the student experience. You give life to our values."</p>
<p>Administered by the Academic Senate's Committee on Teaching, the awards are presented annually to "the best of the best." For the first time, finalists this year were asked to provide a statement of their teaching philosophy, and department chairs submitted letters of support for each finalist. Winners were selected from among more than 150 nominees submitted by students.</p>
<p>Most of the teaching awards include a prize of $500, with the exception of the Ron Ruby Award for Teaching Excellence in the Physical and Biological Sciences, which includes a $750 prize.</p>
<p>Recipients of the UC Santa Cruz 2013 Excellence in Teaching Awards are:</p>
<p><strong>Raoul Birnbaum<br/>
</strong><em>Professor of History of Art and Visual Culture<br/>
</em>Professor Birnbaum teaches Buddhist studies, with a focus on China. This multidisciplinary field combines religion, ethnography, and visual culture; there was no template for teaching in the field. Birnbaum said he initially relied as much on enthusiasm as any formal technique, but that changed over his 40-year career. He credits three sources with inspiring his ascent as a teacher: <em>The Art of Teaching</em> by Gilbert Highet, which he still rereads sections of every few years; saxophonist and improviser Lee Konitz, with whom he studied in the 1980s, who impressed upon him that no matter how familiar the material is, "it has to be alive;" and Chinese Buddhist scholar-monk Ven. Miaojing, who stressed the importance of framing key questions. Students praised Birnbaum and many thanked him for pushing them to excel, to set higher standards, and to achieve more.</p>
<p><strong>Vilashini</strong> <strong>Cooppan<br/>
</strong><em>Associate professor of literature<br/>
</em>Imagine a professor whose students bemoan the brevity of the quarter system because they want to keep learning from her. That's Professor Cooppan. She earns accolades from students in physics, neuroscience, biology, marine biology, and psychology, as well as literature, and they describe her classroom as a "two-way street"&#8212;a balance of lecture and discussion. Cooppan&#160;has wanted to be a literature professor since 10th grade, when an inspiring teacher helped her see that good teachers could be like magicians, helping students make connections and making invisible things visible. Her subject matter&#8212;slavery, colonization, imperialism, apartheid, and their aftermath&#8212; concerns what she calls "the heavy weight of historical trauma," and she challenges her students to leave behind their familiar ways of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Shelly Grabe<br/>
</strong><em>Assistant professor of psychology<br/>
</em>In her personal statement about teaching, Professor Grabe wrote that teaching can be about conformity, or it can encourage the "practice of freedom." She chooses the latter, encouraging her students to allow themselves to be transformed&#8212;inspired and empowered--by the study of transnational feminist psychology. She views learning as a collaborative endeavor and, cognizant of the diversity of life experiences and learning styles within every classroom, she tailors her teaching in ways designed to optimize student engagement. Professor Grabe was described by students as "exceptional," "energetic," "generous," and "engaged." One student wrote that she "refused to make college easy, while simultaneously supporting us the whole way through and giving us a sense of agency over our own learning."</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Knisely<br/>
</strong><em>Lecturer, Oakes College<br/>
</em>Lindsay Knisely, who teaches the core course at Oakes College, believes the ability to write well is the foundation of future success. To that end, she builds her curriculum around student interests, creating a course called "Youth Identity in a Networked Culture" and developing a peer-to-peer student mentoring program. She sets high expectations and is a "warm demander," as one student put it. Knisely works with the most needy students, including English language learners and those on academic probation, and students respond: At graduation, Oakes College asks each student who was especially important to their success at UCSC, and Knisely tops that list every year.</p>
<p><strong>Stefano</strong> <strong>Profumo<br/>
</strong><em>Associate professor of physics<br/>
</em>In Italy, where Professor Profumo studied, students typically had minimal contact with their instructors&#8212;often only interacting during a single hour-long oral final exam. Upon landing his first faculty appointment on campus, Profumo admits he felt intimidated. Today, Profumo is one of the campus's most popular and effective physics teachers, and teaching is a source of enormous professional fulfillment. To succeed, he learned a whole new skill set and embraced UCSC's student-centered approach: He modifies his teaching to meet student needs and focuses on delivering engaging, high-quality lectures, seeking inspiration from books that include <em>The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs</em>. He encourages students to work together in small groups, rewards participation, and integrates research into teaching. The result? Students call his classes relaxing and fun.</p>
<p><strong>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz<br/>
</strong><em>Professor of astronomy and astrophysics<br/>
</em>Professor Ramirez-Ruiz received the 2013 Ron Ruby Award for Teaching Excellence in the Physical and Biological Sciences, an award created by the family of founding physics faculty member Ron Ruby. Ramirez-Ruiz says his teaching is based on his core belief that the key to learning physics is persistence. He emphasizes problem solving above all else, including getting the right answer, and focuses on concepts to underscore that physics is more than memorizing a set of facts and equations. He wants to foster a love of learning and a passion for pursuing intellectual challenges; he builds confidence by providing positive feedback and rewarding effort. Ramirez-Ruiz&#160;approaches lectures as "guided conversations" and encourages students to participate in peer discussion&#8212;the beginning of what he calls professional-style communication that can lead to collaboration outside of class. Department Chair Greg Laughlin describes Ramirez-Ruiz as "tireless," noting that he teaches a full range lower-division through graduate courses, advised an "unprecedented" 17 undergraduates during the past three years, and is the only professor with the stamina and breadth of ideas to advise seven graduate students.</p>
<p><strong>Susan Strome<br/>
</strong><em>Professor of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology<br/>
</em>Professor Susan Strome was recruited from Indiana University in 2007 because of her portfolio of research accomplishments and her leadership in the development of new and innovative strategies for teaching genetics. More than 1,000 students at UCSC take genetics each year, yet it's challenging to create an outstanding learning environment in a large class without lab sections. Enter Susan Strome, who uses clickers to stimulate discussion, overhauled homework assignments to challenge students to think creatively about abstract concepts, and whose in-class demonstrations are legendary: She uses pipe cleaners, beads, pool noodles, and glow sticks to model key concepts and developed skits to act out biological processes. She reinforces classroom learning by offering hands-on workshops outside of class and is a dedicated mentor to both undergraduate and graduate students. Students describe her as kind, helpful, respectful, available, approachable, eager to help students, and fair. In perhaps the most telling testament, one wrote that she "really seems to love teaching."</p>

His team is returning to a set of six borehole observatories they installed in the seafloor off the coast of British Columbia during earlier expeditions in 1996, 2004, and 2010. Using the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) <em>Jason,</em> they will collect samples and data and conduct new experiments.</p>
<p>The public can follow the expedition online starting July 12 at the <a href="http://explorationnow.org/atlantis/"><em>Atlantis</em> Live web site</a>, which features a live video feed, highlight videos, blog posts, and other information. In addition, the <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> will be hosting a talk with Fisher via a live connection to the R/V <em>Atlantis</em> on Sunday, July 21, at 1 p.m. as part of the center's <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/learn/ongoing-education/science-sundays/">Science Sunday</a> lecture series.</p>
<p>Massive flows of warm water move in and out of the seafloor, exchanging heat and chemical compounds between the volcanic ocean crust and the overlying ocean. These flows influence seafloor processes, the evolution of the oceans and the crust, and the development and maintenance of a poorly understood microbial biosphere deep below the seafloor. Experiments conducted during the 2013 expedition will include tracer and flow tests, to determine rates and directions of fluid movement, and microbial colonization experiments to determine what kinds of life inhabit the volcanic ocean crust.</p>
<p>"Recent and ongoing surveys, experiments, and modeling studies are transforming our understanding of these complex hydrothermal systems and revealing flows that are more vigorous, dynamic, and extensive than previously thought," said Fisher, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences.</p>
<p>The UCSC team accompanying Fisher on the expedition includes Dustin Winslow, a graduate student in Earth and planetary sciences, postdoctoral researcher Rachel Lauer, and Jackie Lopez, who earned her B.S. in Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC in 2012 and is now a graduate student in the Education Department's masters degree/teaching credential program.</p>
<p>Fisher is the chief scientist for the expedition, with co-principal investigators from the University of Hawaii, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, UC Santa Barbara, and University of Miami. The borehole observatories are located on the seafloor about 100 miles west of Vancouver, B.C., at a depth of 1.5 miles. This is Fisher's ninth research expedition to this field site.

<br/>
The competitive program awarded 21 fellowships nationwide this year representing universities from New York to Hawaii. Falc&#243;n is one of only two professors in the UC system to win one. Falc&#243;n, who joined the UCSC faculty in 2010, plans to use the time to finish revisions to her book <em>Expanding Racisms: Transnational Feminisms, Intersectionality Politics, and Human Rights in the Am&#233;ricas</em> about the role of women in United Nations forums on racism.<br/>
<br/>
Falc&#243;n said she also plans to write an article based on her extensive archival research about the 1945 U.N. Conference on International Organization, which led to the founding of the U.N.&#160; In her research, Falc&#243;n found that only four of 800 signatories for the U.N. Charter were women; three of those came from the Americas region &#8211; the United States, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic; the fourth delegate was from China.<br/>
<br/>
She said found the Latin American delegates from the 1945 conference "embraced a more explicit and unapologetic feminist politics than the delegate from the U.S., who appears to have been deliberately selected by the U.S. government because she largely distanced herself from any feminist movement."&#160; Yet at the same time, Falc&#243;n said, the Latin American delegates did not denounce overt racism of the time.<br/>
<br/>
A third project for the year ahead will look at the building of a &#8220;human rights culture&#8221; in Peru by focusing on Andean domestic workers seeking knowledge about labor rights, Afro-Peruvians organizing against racial/gender inequalities, and activists/artists seeking to instigate a public conversation about human rights based on the findings from the 2003 Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission.<br/>
<br/>
The Career Enhancement Fellowship, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and administered by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, creates career development opportunities for selected faculty fellows to aid in attaining tenure. The program provides each fellow with a six-month or one-year sabbatical stipend up to $30,000; a research, travel or publication stipend up to $1,500; mentoring; and participation in a fall retreat.<br/>
<br/>
The retreat, an integral part of the program, provides opportunities for fellows to meet at length with their mentors&#8212;senior academics who help advise the early-career faculty on next steps in professional development. Fellows also have the opportunity to connect with Career Enhancement Fellows from past years and other guest scholars.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.mmuf.org/post-doctorates/woodrow-wilson-national-fellowship-foundation</url><title>Mellon

<p>&#8220;Peak oil&#8221; prognosticators have painted pictures of everything from a calm development of alternatives to calamitous shortages, panic and even social collapse. But, according to the study by researchers at Stanford University and UC Santa Cruz, those scenarios assume that an increasingly wealthy world will immediately use all oil pumped out of the ground. Instead, the historical connection between economic growth and oil use is breaking down&#8212;and will continue to do so&#8212;because of the limits of consumption by the wealthy, better fuel efficiency, lower priced alternative fuels and the world&#8217;s rapidly urbanizing population.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an overabundance of concern about oil depletion and not enough attention focused on the substitutes for conventional oil and other possibilities for reducing our dependence on oil,&#8221; said study lead author Adam Brandt, professor of energy resources engineering at Stanford University's School of Earth Sciences.</p>
<p><strong>Variety of mechanisms</strong></p>
<p>The study, published in <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es401419t"><em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em></a><em>,</em> describes a variety of mechanisms that could cause society&#8217;s need for oil to peak around 2035 and then decline. Several earlier studies have suggested that passenger land travel has already plateaued in industrialized countries and is no longer hitched to economic growth. Passenger land travel accounts for about half of global transportation energy demand currently. Even in developing countries, economic growth has been less oil intensive than was seen in the West the past century. China, for example, sells 20 million electric scooters to its citizens a year as part of the government&#8217;s policy to reduce air pollution. That exceeds total U.S. passenger vehicle sales annually.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen explosive growth in car ownership in countries such as China,&#8221; said co-author Adam Millard-Ball, UCSC assistant professor of environmental studies. &#8220;However, those cars will be more efficient than those of the past, and travel demand will eventually saturate as it has in rich countries such as the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Freight and air travel</strong></p>
<p>Freight and air travel have shown no such break from economic growth. Rich people may not drive more beyond a certain income level, but they do fly more and buy more stuff, as do people moving out of poverty. Even in air travel and freight, though, energy efficiency has begun to improve after decades of stagnation, which is lowering oil dependence, according to the new study.</p>
<p>&#8220;A major uncertainty is whether demand to move goods around the world will eventually saturate, as we&#8217;ve seen in the case of passenger transport,&#8221; said Millard-Ball.</p>
<p>Price-competitive alternatives are another factor behind the peak in demand for conventional oil. Increasing quantities of conventional oil substitutes are being produced, including low-quality fuel from oil sands, liquid fuels from coal, natural gas, biofuels, hydrogen and electricity. Technological advances and the high price of oil are helping most such alternatives compete on price. In 2010, the world produced 1.8 million barrels a day of biofuels, six times the amount in 2000. In Argentina, natural gas fuels 15 percent of all cars, due to policies meant to favor the domestic natural gas industry.</p>
<p>The researchers did not try to forecast peak demand&#8217;s impact on oil prices. But even if oil prices spend much time above the historical upper range of $140 a barrel, the peak in demand will only come sooner than they forecast.</p>
<p>&#8220;If prices rise above their current levels for an extended period, we&#8217;re likely to see even more efforts to improve efficiency and exploit alternatives to conventional oil,&#8221; Millard-Ball said. &#8220;That would hasten the onset of a demand-driven peak.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Oil alternatives</strong></p>
<p>The new research, though encouraging, does not describe a transportation future free of worry. Instead, the researchers recommend a shift in attention to the various alternatives to conventional oil. Policymakers should not rely on oil scarcity to constrain damage to the world&#8217;s climate, for example. Alternatives to conventional oil, such as oil sands, liquids from coal and natural gas, biofuels and electricity from renewable sources emit very different amounts of greenhouse gases. At the same time, large scale production of biofuels could have a disruptive impact on food prices and on local ecosystems where the plants are grown.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you care about the environment, you should care about where we are getting these fuels, whether we use the oil sands or biofuels,&#8221; said Brandt. &#8220;Our study is agnostic on what mix of oil substitutes emerges, but we do know that if we don&#8217;t manage them well, there will be big consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study forecasts global oil demand every five years through 2100, under a variety of scenarios for economic growth, population, efficiency gains and fuel substitution.

It can produce nearly 2.2 million pounds of hot water in an hour, enough to power a 30-megawatt power plant.</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An analysis of earthquakes in the area around the Salton Sea Geothermal Field in southern California has found a strong correlation between seismic activity and operations for production of geothermal power, which involve pumping water into and out of an underground reservoir.</p>
<p>"We show that the earthquake rate in the Salton Sea tracks a combination of the volume of fluid removed from the ground for power generation and the volume of wastewater injected," said Emily Brodsky, a geophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and lead author of the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/07/10/science.1239213.abstract">study, published online in <em>Science</em></a> on July 11.</p>
<p>"The findings show that we might be able to predict the earthquakes generated by human activities. To do this, we need to take a large view of the system and consider both the water coming in and out of the ground," said Brodsky, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>Brodsky and coauthor Lia Lajoie, who worked on the project as a UCSC graduate student, studied earthquake records for the region from 1981 through 2012. They compared earthquake activity with production data for the geothermal power plant, including records of fluid injection and extraction. The power plant is a "flash-steam facility" which pulls hot water out of the ground, flashes it to steam to run turbines, and recaptures as much water as possible for injection back into the ground. Due to evaporative losses, less water is pumped back in than is pulled out, so the net effect is fluid extraction.</p>
<p>During the period of relatively low-level geothermal operations before 1986, the rate of earthquakes in the region was also low. Seismicity increased as the operations expanded. After 2001, both geothermal operations and seismicity climbed steadily.</p>
<p>The researchers tracked the variation in net extraction over time and compared it to seismic activity. The relationship is complicated because earthquakes are naturally clustered due to local aftershocks, and it can be difficult to separate secondary triggering (aftershocks) from the direct influence of human activities. The researchers developed a statistical method to separate out the aftershocks, allowing them to measure the "background rate" of primary earthquakes over time.</p>
<p>"We found a good correlation between seismicity and net extraction," Brodsky said. "The correlation was even better when we used a combination of all the information we had on fluid injection and net extraction. The seismicity is clearly tracking the changes in fluid volume in the ground."</p>
<p>The vast majority of the induced earthquakes are small, and the same is true of earthquakes in general. The key question is what is the biggest earthquake that could occur in the area, Brodsky said. The largest earthquake in the region of the Salton Sea Geothermal Field during the 30-year study period was a magnitude 5.1 earthquake.</p>
<p>The nearby San Andreas fault, however, is capable of unleashing extremely destructive earthquakes of at least magnitude 8, Brodsky said. The location of the geothermal field at the southern end of the San Andreas fault is cause for concern due to the possibility of inducing a damaging earthquake.</p>
<p>"It's hard to draw a direct line from the geothermal field to effects on the San Andreas fault, but it seems plausible that they could interact," Brodsky said.</p>
<p>At its southern end, the San Andreas fault runs into the Salton Sea, and it's not clear what faults there might be beneath the water. A seismically active region known as the Brawley Seismic Zone extends from the southern end of the San Andreas fault to the northern end of the Imperial fault. The Salton Sea Geothermal Field, located on the southeastern edge of the Salton Sea, is one of four operating geothermal fields in the area.</p>

<p>The full Board of Regents will act on the recommendation Thursday, July 18, during a special meeting following the board&#8217;s regular bimonthly meeting in San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>'Distinguished public servant'</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Secretary Napolitano is a distinguished and dedicated public servant who has earned trust at the highest, most critical levels of our country&#8217;s government,&#8221; Lansing said in a statement. &#8220;She has proven herself to be a dynamic, hard-working and transformative leader.</p>

<div class="callout-right"><a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/07/napolitano-bio.html">Biography of Janet Napolitano</a><a></a></div>
<p>&#8220;As governor of Arizona, she was an effective advocate for public education, and a champion for the life-changing opportunities that education provides&#8230;Those who know her best say that a passion for education is in her DNA.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
She added: &#8220;As Secretary of Homeland Security, she has been an ardent advocate for the federal Dream Act and the architect of a policy that protects from deportation young undocumented immigrants who are pursuing a college education.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Takes on the toughest challenges</strong></p>
<p>Board Chair Bruce Varner, who served as vice chair of the search committee, noted in a separate statement:&#160; &#8220;Throughout her noteworthy career, Secretary Napolitano has built a track record for taking on and tackling the toughest of challenges. She has a reputation for seeing things through, no matter how difficult the effort.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;She has the intellectual curiosity, leadership qualities, personal charm and discipline needed to navigate any future challenges that await this university.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I anticipate learning much from Secretary Napolitano, given her experience leading large, complex organizations.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Robert Powell, chair of UC&#8217;s systemwide Academic Senate and a faculty representative on the Board of Regents, praised the choice: "In my discussions with her, Secretary Napolitano clearly articulated the view that the University of California must do all it can to ensure not only that it remains the greatest public university in the world in the 21st century, but also that it moves to new heights.<br/>
<br/>
"She has deep respect for the faculty, and she will listen to what we say. She knows that, as the core of what makes UC great, the faculty must have an environment in which they can thrive as scholars and teachers.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>First woman president</strong></p>
<p>If the regents approve the appointment, Napolitano would become the first woman in the university&#8217;s 145-year history to serve as president. She would succeed Mark G. Yudof, who announced in January that he would step down at the end of August after serving for more than five years.<br/>
<br/>
As the twice-elected governor of Arizona, serving from 2003 to 2009, Napolitano was a consistent champion of public education, protecting funding of the state&#8217;s universities even as she addressed a $1 billion deficit upon assuming office. By 2006, she had turned the deficit into a $300 million surplus without raising taxes.<br/>
<br/>
Chosen by President Barack Obama to serve as the third Secretary of Homeland Security, Napolitano leads a complex array of efforts to safeguard the nation &#8211; counterterrorism, border security, immigration enforcement, cybersecurity and disaster preparedness, response and recovery. Homeland Security is the third largest federal department, with a budget of $60 billion, 240,000 employees and 22 agencies and directorates, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Customs and Border Protection, Citizenship and Immigration Services, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Coast Guard and Secret Service.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I am both honored and excited by the prospect of serving as president of the University of California,&#8221; said Napolitano.</p>
<p><strong>'Non-traditional candidate'</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I recognize that I am a non-traditional candidate,&#8221; she added. &#8220;In my experience, whether preparing to govern a state or to lead an agency as critical and complex as Homeland Security, I have found the best way to start is simply to listen.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;If appointed, I intend to reach out and listen to chancellors, to faculty, to students, to the state&#8217;s political leaders, to regents, to the heads of the other public higher education systems and, of course, to President Yudof and his team, who have done so much to steer the University of California through some extremely rough waters.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
As UC president, she would lead a system of 10 campuses, five medical centers, three affiliated national laboratories and a statewide agriculture and natural resources program. The UC system has more than 234,000 students, about 208,000 faculty and staff, more than 1.6 million living alumni and an annual operating budget of more than $24 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Santa Clara University grad</strong></p>
<p>Napolitano, 55, was born in New York City and grew up in Pittsburgh, Pa., and Albuquerque, N.M., before coming to California for her college education. She was graduated from Santa Clara University with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in political science. She was selected as the university&#8217;s first female valedictorian, and also won a Truman Scholarship, a prestigious fellowship for college students who possess leadership potential and an interest in government or public service.<br/>
<br/>
After earning her law degree from the University of Virginia, she went to Arizona in 1983 to serve as a clerk for Judge Mary M. Schroeder of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and later practiced law in Phoenix at the firm of Lewis and Roca, where she became a partner in 1989. She was the first female Attorney General of Arizona, from 1998 to 2003, and served as U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona from 1993 to 1997.<br/>
<br/>
Napolitano was named one of the top five governors in the country by Time magazine. As the first woman to chair the National Governors Association, she launched the &#8220;Innovation America&#8221; initiative to align K-12 and higher education curricula to better prepare students for a global economy and strengthen the nation&#8217;s competitiveness by improving its capacity to innovate.<br/>
<br/>
At the Department of Homeland Security, she has championed cutting-edge research and development, investing more than $2.2 billion in state-of-the-art solutions at national labs and universities across the country to protect people and critical infrastructure.<br/>
<br/>
Under her leadership, Homeland Security also has strengthened its outreach efforts to academic institutions through the establishment of the Office of Academic Engagement, and she created the Homeland Security Academic Advisory Council, involving leadership from more than 20 universities and colleges around the country.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Outreach to education</strong></p>
<p>She has repeatedly testified about the need for comprehensive immigration reform and, earlier this year, she served as the Administration's sole witness in the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill.&#160; She also testified before the Senate in support of the Dream Act and defended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals process in a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee.<br/>
<br/>
The Special Committee to Consider the Selection of a President, assisted by the national executive search firm Issacson, Miller, was involved in recruiting, screening and interviewing candidates. More than 300 possible candidates were considered.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to Varner and Lansing, the immediate past Board of Regents chair, the committee members were Regents Richard Blum, Russell S. Gould, George Kieffer, Bonnie Reiss, and Fred Ruiz. Jonathan Stein (the student regent) and Ronald Rubenstein (the alumni regent) also served on the committee. Gov. Jerry Brown was an ex officio member. An Academic Advisory Committee was appointed to assist the regents' Special Committee. Student, staff and alumni advisory committees joined the Academic Advisory Committee in making recommendations on selection criteria.</p>
<hr/>
<p>(<strong>Note to reporters:</strong> Out of respect for the appointment process, neither Napolitano nor the University of California will comment further until after the Regents have acted on her recommended

<p>With existing 3D television displays, viewers must wear stereo glasses to get the effect of seeing images on the screen in three dimensions, while viewers without the glasses see a blurry image. That's because the 3D TV shows a different image to each eye through the stereo glasses, and a viewer without the glasses sees both images superimposed, resulting in "ghosting."</p>
<p>"There are a lot of reasons why it would be desirable to not need the glasses," said James Davis, associate professor of computer science in the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> at UC Santa Cruz, who led the project. "They can be expensive, so you wouldn't want to buy extra pairs, and they can interfere with other activities."</p>
<p>Davis developed the new technique with UCSC graduate students Steven Scher, Jing Liu, Rajan Vaish, and Prabath Gunawardane. His team will present their 3D+2D TV technology at <a href="http://s2013.siggraph.org/">SIGGRAPH 2013</a>, the 40th International Conference and Exhibition on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, on Thursday, July 25, in Anaheim. They have also described it in a <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2487229&amp;CFID=346689896&amp;CFTOKEN=35106515">paper in the June issue of <em>ACM Transactions on Graphics</em></a>.</p>
<p>Davis's 3D+2D TV shows separate left and right images when viewed through glasses, but those without glasses see only the left image. The system also displays a third image, which is not seen through either lens of the glasses. The third image is the negative of the right image--bright where the right is dark, and dark where the right image is bright--canceling out the right image so those without glasses see only the left image.</p>
<p>With this simple version of the system, 2D viewers see a low-contrast image, because the darkest pixel is relatively bright. To restore acceptable contrast to 2D viewers, the researchers allowed the images seen by the left and right eyes of 3D viewers to have unequal brightness, where the left becomes brighter and the right dimmer. Then they conducted several experiments to determine the optimal brightness ratio between right and left images. They found that brightness ratios in the range between 20 percent and 60 percent were acceptable for viewers both with and without glasses.</p>
<p>The researchers also conducted experiments to quantify the "Pulfrich effect," which slightly distorts depth perception of moving objects when one eye sees a darker image than the other, as if the darker image had been delayed a few milliseconds. They found that this "virtual time delay" is similar in magnitude to the actual time delay experienced with sequential-frame 3D displays, which show left-right image pairs with an 8 millisecond delay between left and right images on a 120-Hz display.</p>
<p>Their findings indicate that the Pulfrich effect is not an obstacle to using unequal brightness for right and left eyes in a 3D+2D TV. In fact, they found that the virtual time delay of the Pulfrich effect can be used to cancel the effect of the actual time delay in a sequential-frame stereo display.</p>
<p>The researchers built a prototype of their 3D+2D TV by aligning a 3D projector with a second, polarized projector used to project the negative of the right image. The image from the polarized projector is not visible through the LCD active shutter glasses synchronized to the 3D projector.</p>
<p>The researchers have filed a patent application, and one of Davis's students, Jing Liu, has been working with students at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business to look into starting a company based on this technology. They are off to a promising start, garnering positive feedback at Stanford's "Startup Weekend" business plan event, Davis said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d3b0e2c7807270463215b74bb9f8b75c"><name>napolitano-bio</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Biography of UC President-Nominee Janet Napolitano</title><summary>A New York City native, Janet Napolitano grew up in Pittsburgh, Pa., and Albuquerque, N.M., where her father was dean of the University of New Mexico School of Medicine.

She received her J.D. degree in 1983 from the University of Virginia School of Law. Napolitano holds honorary degrees from several universities and colleges, including Santa Clara University, Emory University and Pomona College.&#160; In 2010, she was awarded the prestigious Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal (Law), the University of Virginia&#8217;s highest external honor.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d41862f8807270463215b74bb41ad4e0"><name>blumenthal-napolitano</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Homeland Security Chief Janet Napolitano nominated to be next UC president</title><summary>Chancellor Blumenthal shares the news that Homeland Security Chief Janet Napolitano has been nominated to be the next UC president.</summary><start-date>1373616000000</start-date><display-name>Blumenthal-Napolitano</display-name><path>/2013/07/blumenthal-napolitano</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/07/blumenthal-napolitano</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1373652935360</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1373653262074</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Regents today <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/07/uc-president-nomination.html">announced</a> the nomination of U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to be the next president of the University of California. I spoke with Napolitano this morning and look forward to working with our new president, whose nomination will be voted on by the full Board of Regents on July 18.<br/>
<br/>
I am confident that, under Napolitano's leadership, UC will remain the preeminent public research university in the world. She is uniquely positioned to build support for the university, and it's my firm hope that our elected representatives will renew their commitment to the current and future students of this state. Additionally, I look forward to Napolitano's emergence nationally as an advocate both for students and for the research conducted at public universities in general, and at the University of California, in particular.<br/>
<br/>
With her appointment, Napolitano will become the first woman to lead the UC system. Throughout her career, which includes serving as governor of Arizona from 2003 to 2009, she has advocated for public education, university research, and educational opportunities for undocumented immigrants, all of which align with UC Santa Cruz's values. I have invited her to visit our campus as soon as her schedule allows, as I am eager to share our story of excellence and innovation with her. I feel confident our campus will thrive under her leadership.<br/>

<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; Send a representative to a Brown Bag lunch session about the 50th&#160;on July 29.</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; Think of ways your unit or program might help celebrate the 50th.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>The Campus Coordinating Committee has been formed to help organize UCSC's 50th Anniversary, a celebration that will honor the campus' glorious past, its innovative present, and its exciting future.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>The official anniversary season runs from January 2015 through June 2016, under the banner of "50 Years of Innovation and Education for a Global Society."<em>&#160;</em><span>&#160;</span>Our Annual Founder's Day Event in October 2015 will be a key focal point for the acknowledgement of our 50-year milestone.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Please join with us, by&#160;<span>sharing information about campus events or activities</span>&#160;you may already be planning during the celebration window that might be given an anniversary flavor.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>It's up to you (divisions, departments, programs, colleges, student organizations) to identify the special reasons and events for celebrating your program, but we are ready to help.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>Collaboration across units is especially welcome for our campus that has built a reputation for "interdisciplinary."</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>We have begun compiling a preliminary&#160;<a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/resources/timeline.pdf" moz-do-not-send="true">calendar of campus anniversaries</a>&#160;within the 18-month timeframe, to give you an idea of the range of possibilities and to stimulate more ideas and suggestions for 50th&#160;Anniversary enhancements to current plans. We anticipate that some of these programs will want to celebrate their anniversary during this time period.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>If so, please share your prospective initiatives by visiting our website&#160;<a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/" moz-do-not-send="true">50years.ucsc.edu</a><span><span>&#160;and submitting the form on the link under "Getting Ready."</span></span>&#160;We will update our events calendar as we hear from you.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>We are also identifying a variety of ongoing campus events, such as Dean Lecture Series and the Faculty Research Lectures<a id="_GoBack" moz-do-not-send="true" name="_GoBack"></a>&#160;that could be specially adapted as occasions for celebrating the 50th.<span>&#160;&#160;</span><strong>Our goal is to integrate the anniversary with events that are already part of the present fabric of the campus. &#160;</strong>Again, whether your event happens each year or will be developed especially for the 50th, please let us know about it by using this&#160;<a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/event-form/" moz-do-not-send="true">online&#160;form</a>.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Finally, two events to watch for during the summer and early fall.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>First, we are holding an&#160;<strong>informal brown bag lunch on Monday, July 29, from noon to 1 p.m. in the Fireside Lounge of the Graduate Student Commons Building (Quarry Plaza)</strong>&#160;to brainstorm with members of the campus community who are here over the summer.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>Please join us, hear more about current plans, and bring your ideas and questions.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>Second, this fall we will roll out an interactive timeline, putting UCSC history in its national and world context, along with a special section for user-generated content. Stay tuned for more information on when this interactive timeline will be shared.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>We encourage every group on campus to use the umbrella of the 50th for a celebration that will inspire strong support for both our present and future.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>We look forward to hearing your plans and creating an outstanding season of celebration together!</span></div>

<p>&#8220;This was a fantastic opportunity to take everything we&#8217;ve learned over the last years and greatly improve the audience experience,&#8221; noted SSC designer Michael Ganio.</p>
<p>Barricelli added: "I'm very pleased that we were able to build a new structure that offers directors, actors, and designers the space and expanse to fully execute their artistic visions."<br/> <br/> Barricelli will return to the SSC stage in <strong><em>Henry V</em></strong>-- the final play in SSC&#8217;s making-of-a-king trilogy&#8212;which opens on August 6. Actor Charles Pasternak also returns for the title role in <em>Henry V</em>, as the three-year history cycle comes to a close.<br/> <br/> This summer&#8217;s Fringe show will be <strong><em>Tom Jones</em></strong>, adapted by Jon Jory from the classic Henry Fielding novel. A bawdy and rollicking comedy, this play will be directed by SSC alumna and UCSC Theater Arts faculty member, Patty Gallagher. It makes its West Coast premiere for two performances only, August 20 and 27.<br/> <br/> Shakespeare Santa Cruz also has a number of educational events available to the public this summer in addition to the plays.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s much more to Shakespeare Santa Cruz than just attending a performance or two,&#8221; noted Barricelli. &#8220;We want our community to meet the artists, learn about the plays and processes, and have the opportunity to ask questions and have a voice in what we do.&#8221;</p>
<p>These events include SSC&#8217;s free discussion series at the Nickelodeon Theater in downtown Santa Cruz, where community members have the opportunity to meet SSC actors and directors as they discuss each production and answer questions from the audience.</p>
<p>The director and cast of <em>Henry V&#8232;</em> will be at the &#8220;Noon at the Nick&#8221; series on July 19, and the director and cast of <em>Tom Jones</em> are scheduled for July 28. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Backstage tours will also be available every Saturday from July 27 to August 31, beginning at 11:45 a.m. The cost is $5 (payable by cash or check), or free for donors contributing $75 and up. To make reservations contact Gina Marie Hayes at 831-459-5109 or gmhayes@ucsc.edu.</p>
<p>Tickets for the 2013 Shakespeare Santa Cruz summer festival can be purchased online at <a href="http://www.shakespearesantacruz.org/tickets/">http://www.shakespearesantacruz.org/tickets/</a> or by calling 831-459-2159. The season runs through September 1.</p>

observation</article-subhead><article-text><p>Standing in the colorful toddler room of UC Santa Cruz's Early Childhood Education Center, a small girl discovers a view of her elbow in a pink hand mirror. Her brow furrows as she studies the previously unexamined joint. She turns the mirror toward her toes, then her knees &#8212; and breaks into a grin.</p>
<p>It's one of those wonderful moments in childhood development that might have gone unnoticed &#8212; except for a new child-study observation room installed last year at UCSC's busy Early Childhood Education Center as part of a $165,000 grant from the Claire Giannini Fund.</p>
<p>The room, remodeled at a cost of $30,000, not only allows UCSC advanced developmental psychology students a place to readily practice scientific observation but also lets Early Childhood Education Center staff hone their skills, permits parents to observe their children, and facilitates faculty research.</p>
<p>"It's a bridge to research and teaching," says Early Education Services Director Sohyla Fathi.</p>
<p>For years, UCSC's developmental psychology students have had to drive halfway across the county to Cabrillo College to experience the rigors of scientific observation &#8212; "a fundamental skill of scientific practice," according to Emerita Professor of Psychology Catherine Cooper.</p>
<p>While the large number of beginning students still can't be accommodated at the new child-study center, advanced students can simply walk to Family Student Housing, where the center is located, in order to hone their research abilities.</p>
<p>Sitting in the small room, which is equipped with a one-way mirror, three sets of headphones and an unassuming writing table, advanced students in classes taught by professors Nameera Ahktar and Su-hua Wang spend 30 minutes at a time carefully observing the behavior of children from 11-24 months of age. They study physical and language development, they watch how children play, how teachers guide their charges. Students are then called upon to analyze what they have seen &#8212; the way any scientific researcher would.</p>
<p>"It sharpens the eye and the ear," says Cooper of the skills students learn at the center. "It attunes them to patterning in human behavior."</p>
<p>It's a proficiency, she says, students can take into the real world.</p>
<p>For Fathi, who directs the program, the observation room provides a way for teachers to sharpen their skills and improve curriculum design. The observation room also opens opportunities for other potential funding because the program now has a research lab attached to it. Setting up the room has been at the top of her priority list since she took over the program two years ago, Fathi says, and wouldn't have been possible without the Claire Giannini grant.</p>
<p>Betsy Buchalter Adler (Cowell, '70, psychology), one of the trustees of the $29-million Claire Giannini Fund, says the opportunity to support not only UCSC's observation room but also to increase hours so student-parents don't have to miss late-afternoon or early-morning classes is something Claire Giannini Hoffman would have appreciated.</p>
<p>The daughter of Bank of America founder A.P. Giannini and a businesswoman in her own right, Giannini specified that her trust be spent on the health, wellbeing and education of children under the age of 18.</p>
<p>"Good early childhood education is one of the best investments you can make in a community," says Buchalter Adler, who notes the trust does not accept unsolicited proposals.</p>
<p>The grant also has allowed faculty and staff to provide workshops for parents on topics like toddlers and media, and on bilingual education.</p>
<p>"This is a learning community," Cooper says as she stands in the new observation room, "and we're all learning together."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page

governor takes over in September as the University of California's 20th president</article-subhead><article-text><p>The University of California Board of Regents July 18 appointed Janet Napolitano, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a two-term governor of Arizona, as the 20th president of the University of California.</p>
<p>Napolitano, the first female president in UC's 145-year history, succeeds Mark G. Yudof, who steered the university through the depths of California's financial crisis that led to sharp cutbacks in state support for public higher education.</p>
<p>Yudof, 68, served for more than five years and will remain on the job until Napolitano begins her tenure in late September. Napolitano was appointed during a special meeting of the board following a recommendation by the regents' special search committee last week.</p>
<p>"I am humbled by your support and look forward to working with you to build further on the excellence of UC," Napolitano said after the regents appointed her president.</p>
<p><strong>Unanimous choice</strong></p>
<p>Napolitano, 55, an accomplished public sector leader with a long-standing interest in education, was the search committee's unanimous choice from among more than 300 prospective candidates. As UC's president, she will oversee 10 campuses and five medical centers &#8212; plus a new medical school at UC Riverside &#8212; as well as three affiliated national laboratories and a statewide agriculture and natural resources program.</p>
<p>The University of California, widely considered the nation's premier public university system, enrolls more than 234,000 students, employs about 208,000 faculty and staff, and counts more than 1.6 million living alumni. Its annual operating budget stands at more than $24 billion.</p>
<p>UC Regent Sherry Lansing, who chaired the presidential search committee, called Napolitano a transformative leader and tireless champion for the life-changing opportunities that education provides. She and other regents praised her intellectual curiosity, political acumen, personal dynamism and willingness to tackle complicated issues as attributes that will serve her &#8212; and the University of California &#8212; well.</p>
<p>"As governor of Arizona, Napolitano was a strong advocate for public education, from K-12 to the university level," said UC Regents Chair Bruce Varner. "She appreciates the importance of public research universities, faculty scholarship and research, and UC's role in shaping California.</p>
<p>"I am confident that she has the background and attributes needed to build upon the excellent work of her predecessor, Mark G. Yudof, and to lead the university forward to even greater achievements."</p>
<p>President Barack Obama, who chose Napolitano to head Homeland Security &#8212; the third largest federal department &#8212; praised her remarkable career of public service after it was announced she was leaving his cabinet to lead the University of California. He emphasized her leadership skills, tireless work ethic, judgment and advice, as well as the value of her friendship.</p>
<p><strong>Santa Clara University valedictorian</strong></p>
<p>Napolitano was born in New York City and grew up in Pittsburgh, Pa., and Albuquerque, N.M., before coming to California to attend college. She earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Santa Clara University, where she was named the university's first female valedictorian. She also won a Truman Scholarship, a prestigious fellowship for college students who have demonstrated leadership and an interest in government or public service.</p>
<p>After earning her law degree from the University of Virginia, she went to Arizona in 1983 to serve as a clerk for Judge Mary M. Schroeder of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and later practiced law in Phoenix at the firm of Lewis and Roca, where she became a partner in 1989. She was the first female attorney general of Arizona, from 1998 to 2003, and served as U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona from 1993 to 1997.</p>
<p>Napolitano was twice elected governor of Arizona, serving from 2003 to 2009, and was named one of the top five governors in the country by Time magazine. As the first woman to chair the National Governors Association, she launched the "Innovation America" initiative to align K-12 and higher education curricula to better prepare students for a global economy and strengthen the nation's competitiveness by improving its capacity to innovate.</p>
<p>At the Department of Homeland Security, she has championed cutting-edge research and development, investing more than $2.2 billion in state-of-the-art solutions at national labs and universities across the country to protect people and critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>Under her leadership, Homeland Security also has strengthened its outreach efforts to academic institutions through the establishment of the Office of Academic Engagement; and she created the Homeland Security Academic Advisory Council, involving leadership from more than 20 universities and colleges around the country.</p>
<p><strong>Immigration reform advocate</strong></p>
<p>Napolitano has repeatedly testified about the need for comprehensive immigration reform and, earlier this year, she served as the Obama administration's sole witness in the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill. She also testified before the Senate in support of the Dream Act and defended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals process in a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>UC's Special Committee to Consider the Selection of a President, assisted by the national executive search firm Isaacson, Miller, was involved in recruiting, screening and interviewing candidates for the university's top administrative position.</p>
<p>In addition to Varner and Lansing, the immediate past Board of Regents chair, the committee members were regents Richard Blum, Russell S. Gould, George Kieffer, Bonnie Reiss and Fred Ruiz. Jonathan Stein (student regent) and Ronald Rubenstein (alumni regent) also served on the committee. Gov. Jerry Brown was an ex officio member. An academic advisory committee was appointed to assist the regents' special committee. Student, staff and alumni advisory committees joined the Academic Advisory Committee in making recommendations on the selection criteria.</p>
<p>As UC president, Napolitano will receive a base salary of $570,000. Her predecessor's annual base salary was $591,084, plus an auto allowance of $8,916. She also will receive an auto allowance of $8,916. Her salary is below the 25th percentile of cash compensation for comparable systemwide university presidents, which stands at $617,000. That means more than 75 percent of university system leaders nationally earn more than her annual salary.</p>
<p>As a condition of her employment and for the convenience of the university, Napolitano will be required to live in housing leased by UC or later, if one becomes available, a university-owned home.</p>
<p>She also will receive a one-time relocation fee of $142,500 which is 25 percent of her annual base salary. Under UC policy, this amount is intended to reimburse one-time and ongoing, unreimbursed expenses associated with the transition and will be paid as a lump sum. If Napolitano leaves her position within four years, these funds must be repaid to the university according to the following schedule: 100 percent if separation occurs within the first year of employment, 60 percent if separation occurs within the second year of employment, 30 percent if separation occurs within the third year of employment, and 10 percent if separation occurs within the fourth year of employment.</p>
<p>Napolitano will receive standard health and retirement benefits, and a contribution of 5 percent of her salary to the Senior Management Supplemental Benefit Program. By virtue of her appointment beginning after July 1, 2013, she will be included under the new tier of the UC Retirement Program.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.ucop.edu/napolitano/index.html</url><title>About Janet Napolitano</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/07/varner-letter.html</url><title>Letter from UC Regents Chair Bruce Varner</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/07/blumenthal-napolitano.html</url><title>Chancellor Blumenthal's message on Napolitano's nomination</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f3eb3281807270463215b74b7198030d"><name>varner-letter</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Letter from UC Board of Regents Chairman Bruce Varner</title><summary>As chairman of the UC Board of Regents, I am pleased to announce that today (July 18) U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano was appointed as the 20th president of the University of California.</summary><start-date>1374184800000</start-date><display-name>Regents Chair's letter</display-name><path>/2013/07/varner-letter</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/07/varner-letter</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1374186844745</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1374188339497</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear UC Colleagues,<br/>
<br/>
As chairman of the UC Board of Regents, I am pleased to announce that today (July 18) U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano was appointed as the 20th president of the University of California.<br/>
<br/>
She will take office in late September, bringing extensive experience in tackling tough challenges and leading large, complex organizations. The Special Committee to Consider the Selection of a President unanimously chose Secretary Napolitano from a dynamic pool of more than 300 potential candidates. We were all impressed with her extraordinary character, intellectual curiosity and commitment to higher education.<br/>
<br/>
As governor of Arizona, Napolitano was a strong advocate for public education, from K-12 to the university level. She appreciates the importance of public research universities, faculty scholarship and research and UC's role in shaping California.<br/>
<br/>
I am confident that she has the background and attributes needed to build upon the excellent work of her predecessor, Mark G. Yudof, and to lead the University forward to even greater achievements.<br/>
<br/>
Already, she has expressed an eagerness to join the UC community and to get to know the stellar faculty, staff, students and alumni who make this University great. I am looking forward to working with her and benefitting from her vast stores of expertise.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Bruce D. Varner<br/>

<br/>
The display is drawn from Auger&#8217;s photography-based project incorporating text and video: <em>This Is Not Me: Enduring Syria&#8217;s War</em>&#8212;currently on exhibition at the Gulf and Western Gallery at New York University through August 2013.<br/>
<br/>
Auger&#8217;s project documents the lives of two Syrian men now living outside their home country.</p>
<p>It looks beyond the physical destruction caused by the war to focus on the emotional and mental toll of those displaced by the violence.<br/>
<br/>
Auger received her Master&#8217;s degree in Social Documentation from UC Santa Cruz in 2011 and is now an independent media artist living in Beirut, Lebanon.<br/>
<br/>
She works as a still photographer and videographer, covering breaking news, and also does camera work for documentary films.<br/>
<br/>
Auger&#8217;s work has been published by <em>CNN, Syria Today, The Guardian, The Daily Beast, The Christian Science Monitor, GlobalPost</em>, the I<em>nternational Organization for Migration</em>, and the <em>UN Refugee Agency</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Her work has taken her to a variety of countries, including Egypt, Oman, Libya, Lebanon, Iraqi Kurdistan, Kashmir, Mongolia, China, as well as the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
In 2011, Auger was following women activists in Egypt&#8217;s Tahrir Square when they came under fire during a clash between protesters and police.<br/>
<br/>
Auger&#8217;s video of that incident was featured on the <em>Daily Beast</em> and posted on the Center for Investigative Reporting&#8217;s <em>GlobalPost</em> site.<br/>
<br/>
B. Ruby Rich, co-director of the Social Documentation program in UCSC&#8217;s Film and Digital Media Department, noted that &#8220;many remember Auger&#8217;s amazing photographs and short film in our grad exhibition of 2011 on Syrian refugees living in San Diego.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Prior to her UCSC graduate work, Auger earned a degree in photography and imaging from New York University&#8217;s Tisch School of the Arts.<br/>

<br/>
The study by Berry Brosi, an assistant professor at Emory University, and Heather Briggs, a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz, was published Monday in the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/07/17/1307438110">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>. It focused on interactions between bumblebees and larkspur wildflowers in Colorado&#8217;s Rocky Mountains.<br/>
<br/>
The results show how reduced competition among pollinators disrupts floral fidelity, or specialization, among the remaining bees in the system, leading to less successful plant reproduction.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We found that these wildflowers produce one-third fewer seeds in the absence of just one bumblebee species,&#8221; said Brosi, an ecologist. &#8220;That&#8217;s alarming, and suggests that global declines in pollinators could have a bigger impact on flowering plants and food crops than was previously realized.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Community ecologist</strong><br/>
<br/>
Co-author Briggs, a doctoral candidate in environmental studies at UCSC, said floral fidelity clearly benefits plants, because a pollinator visit will only lead to plant reproduction when the pollinator is carrying pollen from the same plant species.&#160; &#8220;When bees are promiscuous, visiting plants of more than one species during a single foraging session, they are much less effective as pollinators,&#8221; she said.<br/>
<br/>
Briggs is a community ecologist whose work focuses primarily on plant-pollinator interactions and their resilience to environmental changes. The study was funded by the National Science Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
Briggs, who received her B.S. at the University of Nevada Reno and M.S. at the University of Michigan, said she came to UCSC for her doctorate "because it is a highly interdisciplinary department in which I can pursue my passion for ecology and natural resource science while learning how to communicate the importance of my findings to a broader audience. "<br/>
<br/>
She said her experience "has taught me to frame my ecological questions in a way that is engaging for not only ecologists, but also environmental policymakers, and land managers."<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Plant-animal connecction</strong><br/>
<br/>
About 90 percent of plants need animals, mostly insects, to transfer pollen between them so that they can fertilize and reproduce. Bees are by far the most important pollinators worldwide and have co-evolved with the floral resources they need for nutrition.<br/>
<br/>
During the past decade, however, scientists have reported dramatic declines in populations of some bee species, sparking research into the potential impact of such declines.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Some studies have indicated that plants can tolerate losing most pollinator species in an ecosystem as long as other pollinators remain to take up the slack. Those studies, however, were based on theoretical computer modeling.<br/>
<br/>
Brosi and Briggs were curious whether this theoretical resilience would hold up in real-life scenarios. Their team conducted field experiments to learn how the removal of a single pollinator species would affect the plant-pollinator relationship.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Serial monogamists</strong><br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Most pollinators visit several plant species over their lifetime, but often they will display what we call floral fidelity over shorter time periods,&#8221; Brosi said. &#8220;They&#8217;ll tend to focus on one plant while it&#8217;s in bloom, then a few weeks later move on to the next species in bloom. You might think of them as serial monogamists.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The researchers conducted their experiments at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory near Crested Butte, Colo. Located at 9,500 feet, the facility&#8217;s subalpine meadows are too high for honeybees, but they are buzzing with bumblebees during the summer months. The experiments focused on the interactions of the insects with larkspurs, dark-purple wildflowers that are visited by 10 of the of the 11 bumblebee species there.<br/>
<br/>
The researchers studied a series of 20-meter square wildflower plots, evaluating each one in both a control state, left in its natural condition, and in a manipulated state, in which they used nets to remove the bumblebees of just one species.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Flight of the bumblebee</strong><br/>
<br/>
The researchers then observed the bumblebee behavior in both the controlled plots and the manipulated plots. &#8220;We&#8217;d literally follow around the bumblebees as they foraged,&#8221; Briggs said. &#8220;It&#8217;s challenging because the bees can fly pretty fast.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the researchers could only record between five and 10 movements, while in other cases they could follow the bees to 100 or more flowers.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Running around after bumblebees in these beautiful wildflower meadows was one of the most fun parts of the research,&#8221; said Brosi.<br/>
<br/>
The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory is exacting about using non-destructive methodologies so that researchers don&#8217;t have a negative impact on the bumblebee populations. &#8220;When we caught bees to remove target species from the system, or to swab their bodies for pollen, we released them unharmed when our experiments were over,&#8221; Brosi says. &#8220;They&#8217;re very robust little creatures.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Across the steps of the pollination process, from patterns of bumblebee visits to plants, to picking up pollen, to seed production, the researchers saw a cascading effect of removing one bee species. While about 78 percent of the bumblebees in the control groups were faithful to a single species of flower, only 66 percent of the bumblebees in the manipulated groups showed such floral fidelity. The reduced fidelity in manipulated plots meant that bees in the manipulated groups carried more different types of pollen on their bodies than those in the control groups.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Reduced seed production</strong><br/>
<br/>
These changes had direct implications for plant reproduction: Larkspurs produced about one-third fewer seeds when one of the bumblebee species was removed, compared to the larkspurs in the control groups.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The small change in the level of competition made the remaining bees more likely to &#8216;cheat&#8217; on the larkspur,&#8221; Briggs said.<br/>
<br/>
While previous research has shown how competition drives specialization within a species, the bumblebee study is one of the first to link this mechanism back to the broader functioning of an ecosystem.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Our work shows why biodiversity may be key to conservation of an entire ecosystem,&#8221; Brosi says. &#8220;It has the potential to open a whole new set of studies into the functional implications of interspecies interactions.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/07/17/1307438110</url><title>Original paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0d860c0e807270463215b74b4fecbe6e"><name>our-university-july</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Our University - July 2013</title><summary>The July issue of Our University, the systemwide newsletter for faculty and staff, is now available.</summary><start-date>1374566400000</start-date><display-name>Our University - July 2013</display-name><path>/2013/07/our-university-july</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/07/our-university-july</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1374616423381</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1374616899574</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div><span>July 23, 2013<br/>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz professor Mark Fathi Massoud's family fled Sudan in 1983 when he was a boy. He returned to his homeland more than two decades later, while a Berkeley Ph.D. student, as the nation was ending Africa's longest civil war.<br/>
<br/>
Now a lawyer and assistant professor of politics and legal studies at UCSC, Massoud has published his first book, <em>Law&#8217;s Fragile State: Colonial, Authoritarian, and Humanitarian Legacies in Sudan</em> (<a href="http://www.cambridge.org/9781107026070">Cambridge University Press, 2013</a>), examining how legal order and the rule of law develop in war-torn settings.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
<em>Law&#8217;s Fragile State</em> comes out as Sudan marks a series of important anniversaries. July 1 commemorates the country&#8217;s 1956 independence from the British, the first sub-Saharan African country to break from British rule. July 9, 2005 was the beginning of a transitional government that ended Sudan&#8217;s 23-year civil war; and two years ago, July 9, 2011, saw the secession of South Sudan, the world&#8217;s newest country. (In a power struggle this week, South Sudan&#8217;s president dismissed his first vice president and all 29 government ministers.)<br/>
<br/>
Massoud spent 15 months between 2005 and 2010 conducting research in Sudan and in Sudan's 20th-century colonial masters &#8211; England and Egypt. He uncovered the ways different political actors &#8211; colonial administrators, postcolonial governments, and international aid agencies &#8211; use legal resources to promote stability and their own visions of the rule of law amid political violence and war.<br/>
<br/>
"I wrote the book to investigate the nature of the law and how law is used both to develop and to disrupt authority," Massoud said. "I also wrote the book to understand Sudan."<br/>
<br/>
Massoud said the law is essential to, not missing from, states fighting for political stability. "What I learned surprised me. Contrary to the conventional wisdom of a legal vacuum in 'failed' or fragile states, the law matters immensely," he said. "Governments &#8211; colonial, democratic, and authoritarian &#8211; and civic organizations &#8211; regardless of their orientation &#8211; all seek to promote law and legal progress. They have constructed law schools, educated people about the law, built courts, and drafted constitutions to help them promote their political goals and achieve social or economic stability."<br/>
<br/>
Massoud continues to be drawn to the world&#8217;s toughest places. For the past two months he's been in Somaliland, a self-declared independent country that the rest of the world considers the northern region of Somalia.<br/>
<br/>
Somalia was recently <a href="http://ffp.statesindex.org/rankings-2013-sortable">ranked the world's most failed state</a>, just ahead of Sudan, ranked third, and South Sudan, which debuted this year at fourth.<br/>
<br/>
"These are the places where I have sought to investigate the dynamic nature, purpose, and functions of law," Massoud said, "and the role of legal professionals in constructing states out of war-torn regions."<br/>
<br/>
Massoud said promoting the rule of law cuts two ways. "Certainly under the right conditions it can help to establish democracy. But the building blocks of the rule of law &#8211; stable government, courts, law schools, and prison systems &#8211; can also be the bedrock of authoritarian rule."<br/>
<br/>
He said governments, even dictatorial ones, want to ensure that people&#8217;s disputes are resolved and that grievances against the state are processed. "Getting the job done quickly enhances social stability."<br/>
<br/>
During the 1990s at the height of Sudan&#8217;s civil war, the government of President Omar al-Bashir made huge investments in its judiciary, the likes of which had not been seen since British colonial officials arrived a century earlier. Law&#8217;s Fragile State details the emergence of hundreds of new courts and more than a dozen new law schools around the country.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;And that was just the beginning,&#8221; Massoud said. State development under Bashir has been rooted in both law and religion &#8211; a vision of Islamic law that demands adherence because of its claims to divine authority and because of the people&#8217;s profound piety.<br/>
<br/>
Massoud returns to UCSC this fall. His research and writing have been supported by fellowships from Fulbright-Hays, Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation, UC Santa Cruz, UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and McGill University.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.cambridge.org/9781107026070

Center</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Helen Shapiro, provost of Colleges Nine and Ten at UC Santa Cruz, has been named executive director of the <a href="http://www.ucdc.edu/who-we-are/">University of California's Washington Center</a> known as UCDC.&#160;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Shapiro, a UCSC professor of sociology, takes over September 1 for an initial five-year term. She succeeds UCSC professor Melanie DuPuis, who has served as interim executive director for the past year after Bruce Cain, the longtime executive director, retired in June 2012.<br/>
<br/>
Shapiro, selected after a systemwide search, will be responsible for management and operation of the UCDC center, an 11-story residential facility, and also will oversee the center's academic program. She'll collaborate with the UC nine undergraduate campuses on academic programming and faculty hiring, fundraise for the center, and interact with agencies and the local community to sustain and further UCDC programs.<br/>
<br/>
The position is unique within the UC system, said <a href="http://www.ucdc.edu/who-we-are/executive-directors-page">Susan Carlson, UC vice provost for academic affairs, in making the announcement</a>.<br/>
<br/>
UCDC, opened in 2001 and located near Washington's Dupont Circle, can house more than 270 students and provides students and faculty with opportunities to study, research, work, and live within the capital's cultural, political and international heritage. Undergraduates typically spend an academic quarter taking classes and completing internships. UC professors can use the center as a base while conducting research in Washington.<br/>
<br/>
"UCDC provides students with life-changing experiences in Washington, DC.,"&#160; said Shapiro, who served as a visiting professor there for two-terms in 2004-05. "I am very much looking forward to working with the UCDC staff and faculty, as well as with each campus, to ensure that the program thrives and is accessible to all qualified students."<br/>
<br/>
Shapiro said she loved being provost at Colleges Nine and Ten where she served since 2006 and that the experience made her a serious candidate for the UCDC job. She also served as associate dean for the Division of Social Sciences. From 1997 to 2006, she taught UCSC undergraduate courses in Latin American and Latino studies, economics, and sociology. She also taught at the Harvard Business School from 1988-1996<br/>
<br/>
Shapiro holds a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University. Her research interests focus on economic policy and international relations, and she has published extensively in the area of economic development in Latin America.<br/>
<br/>
Sheldon Kamieniecki, the dean of Social Sciences, said a search would be launched to find a replacement for Shapiro as provost. He said anthropology professor Matthew J. Wolf-Meyer will serve as interim provost beginning August 1 and through the fall quarter. Psychology professor Campbell Leaper, the founding provost at Nine and Ten, will serve as provost during the winter and spring quarters.<br/>
<br/>
Kamieniecki thanked Shapiro for her service to the Social Sciences division, praising her efforts to navigate around many budget reductions the campus has experienced. "She has done a wonderful job modifying the curricula at Colleges Nine and Ten, organizing extremely interesting and sometimes provocative conferences, meetings, and forums on critical social, political, cultural, and economic topics, fundraising for both Colleges, and providing visionary leadership," he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.ucdc.edu/who-we-are/</url><title>University of California Washington Center</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.ucdc.edu/who-we-are/executive-directors-page</url><title>UC Academic Affairs Vice Provost Susan Carlson's announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="17d215ab807270463215b74be4f7a19a"><name>in-memoriam-shayne-coppedge</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam – Shayne Coppedge</title><summary>We regret to tell you that Shayne Marie Coppedge, a recent graduate of the University and a member of Porter College, died unexpectedly on July 3, 2013, from a pulmonary embolism. </summary><start-date>1374739200000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam – Shayne Coppedge</display-name><path>/2013/07/in-memoriam-shayne-coppedge</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/07/in-memoriam-shayne-coppedge</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1374789178736</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1374789295704</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div><span class="Apple-style-span">We regret to tell you that Shayne Marie Coppedge, a recent graduate of the University and a member of Porter College, died unexpectedly on July 3, 2013, from a pulmonary embolism.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>Shayne majored in Ecology &amp; Evolution, was employed in one of the Department&#8217;s labs, and aspired to work in the area of conservation.<span>&#160;&#160;</span>As befits a member of Porter College, Shayne also loved the arts, especially painting, writing, and music, and she shared these passions with everyone who knew her.</span></div>

<br/>
The new research indicates that dance marking--loosely practicing a routine by &#8220;going through the motions&#8221;-- may improve the quality of dance performance by reducing the mental strain needed to perfect the movements.<br/>
<br/>
The new findings in the top journal of the <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/">Association for Psychological Science</a>, suggest that marking may lessen the conflict between the cognitive and physical aspects of dance practice, allowing dancers to memorize and repeat steps more fluidly.<br/>
<br/>
Researcher <a href="http://theater.ucsc.edu/faculty/ted-warburton">Edward Warburton</a>, a former professional ballet dancer and professor of theater arts (Dance) at UC Santa Cruz, noted that he and his colleagues were interested in exploring what he terms the &#8220;thinking behind the doing of dance.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It is widely assumed that the purpose of dance marking is to conserve energy,&#8221; said Warburton. &#8220;But elite-level dance is not only physically demanding, it&#8217;s cognitively demanding as well. Learning and rehearsing a dance piece requires concentration on many aspects of the desired performance.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Warburton added that marking involves a run-through of the dance routine, but with a focus on the routine itself, as opposed to making the perfect movements.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;When marking, the dancer often does not leave the floor, and may even substitute hand gestures for movements,&#8221; said Warburton. &#8220;One common example is using a finger rotation to represent a turn while not actually turning the whole body.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The study involved asking a group of talented dance students to learn two routines: practicing one at performance speed and the other one by marking.<br/>
<br/>
Although the routines were relatively simple and designed to be learned quickly, differences emerged when the judges looked at the quality of performance.<br/>
<br/>
The dancers were judged significantly higher on the routine that they had practiced with marking--their movements on the marked routine appeared to be more seamless and the sequences more fluid.<br/>
<br/>
Warburton said that the study suggests that practicing at performance speed didn&#8217;t allow the dancers to memorize and consolidate the steps as a sequence, affecting their performance.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;By reducing the demands on complex control of the body, marking may reduce the multi-layered cognitive load used when learning choreography,&#8221; said Warburton <br/>
<br/>
He added that marking could be strategically used by teachers and choreographers to enhance memory and integration of multiple aspects of a piece--precisely at those times when dancers are working to master the most demanding material.<br/>
<br/>
Warburton observed that this area of research could also possibly extend to other kinds of activities, including language acquisition.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Smaller scale movement systems with low energetic costs such as speech, sign language, and gestures may likewise accrue cognitive benefits, as might be the case in learning new multisyllabic vocabulary or working on one&#8217;s accent in a foreign language.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Co-authors on the study include UC Santa Cruz associate professor of psychology Margaret Wilson, and Molly Lynch and Shannon Cuykendall of the University of California, Irvine.<br/>

<p><em><span>Susan and Ty</span></em></p>
<p><span>Dear colleagues,</span></p>
<p><span>We write as co-chairs of the 50th&#160;Anniversary Campus Coordinating Committee to update the campus community on planning for a season of celebrations in 2015 and to encourage ideas for events and projects.&#160;As you read ahead, please consider two things:</span></p>
<p><span>&#8226; Send a representative to a Brown Bag lunch session about the 50th&#160;on July 29.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8226; Think of ways your unit or program might help celebrate the 50th.</span></p>
<p><span>The Campus Coordinating Committee has been formed to help organize UCSC's 50th Anniversary, a celebration of our past 50 years as they illuminate the future at this moment half-way to the completion of our first century. The official anniversary season runs from January 2015 through June 2016, under the banner of "50 Years of Innovation and Education for a Global Society."<em>&#160;</em>&#160;The Annual Founders Day event in October 2015 will be a key focal point for the acknowledgement of our 50-year milestone.</span></p>
<p><span>Please join with us, by&#160;sharing information about campus events or activities&#160;you may already be planning during the celebration window that might be given an anniversary flavor.&#160;&#160;It's up to you (divisions, departments, programs, colleges, student organizations) to identify the special reasons and events for celebrating your program, but we are ready to help.&#160;&#160;Collaboration across units is especially welcome for our campus that has built a reputation for the interdisciplinary.</span></p>
<p><span>We have begun compiling a preliminary&#160;</span><a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/resources/timeline.pdf"><span>calendar of campus anniversaries</span></a><span>&#160;within the 18-month timeframe, to give you an idea of the range of possibilities and to stimulate more ideas and suggestions for 50th&#160;Anniversary enhancements to current plans. We anticipate that some of these programs will want to celebrate their anniversary during this time period.&#160;&#160;If so, please share your prospective initiatives by visiting our website&#160;</span><a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/"><span>50years.ucsc.edu</span></a><span>&#160;and submitting the form on the link under "Getting Ready."&#160;We will update our events calendar as we hear from you.</span></p>
<p><span>We are also identifying a variety of ongoing campus events, such as Dean Lecture Series and the Faculty Research Lectures&#160;that could be specially adapted as occasions for celebrating the 50th.&#160;&#160;<strong>Our goal is to integrate the anniversary with events that are already part of the present fabric of the campus. &#160;</strong>Again, whether your event happens each year or will be developed especially for the 50th, please let us know about it by using this&#160;</span><a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/event-form/"><span>online&#160;form</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, two events to watch for during the summer and early fall.&#160;&#160;First, we are holding an&#160;<strong>informal brown bag lunch on Monday, July 29, from noon to 1 p.m. in the Fireside Lounge of the Graduate Student Commons Building (Quarry Plaza)</strong>&#160;to brainstorm with members of the campus community who are here over the summer.&#160;&#160;Please join us, hear more about current plans, and bring your ideas and questions.&#160;&#160;Second, this fall we will roll out an interactive timeline, putting UCSC history in its national and world context, along with a special section for user-generated content. Stay tuned for more information on when this interactive timeline will be shared.</span></p>
<p><span>We encourage every group on campus to use the umbrella of the 50th for a celebration that will inspire strong support for both our present and future.&#160;&#160;We look forward to hearing your plans and creating an outstanding season of celebration together!</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>Susan Gillman and Tyrus Miller, Co-Chairs, UCSC 50th Anniversary Campus Coordinating Committee</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2b19f27680727046587bc9a9b9e21d98"><name>tmt-master-agreement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scientific authorities sign TMT master agreement </title><summary>The scientific authorities of the Thiry Meter Telescope partners have signed a master agreement defining the project goals and establishing a governance structure.</summary><keywords>Thirty Meter Telescope, TMT, Sandra Faber, UCO, UC Observatories</keywords><start-date>1375084800000</start-date><display-name>Scientific authorities sign TMT master agreement </display-name><path>/2013/07/tmt-master-agreement</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/07/tmt-master-agreement</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1375112655409</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1375113416803</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/07/images/signing-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/07/images/signing-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>signing-400.jpg</name><display-name>signing-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>89062</file-size><width>390</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt>signing ceremony</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/07/images/signing-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/07/images/signing-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>signing-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>signing-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>30374</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>signing ceremony</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Scientific authorities of the TMT partners signed the master agreement at a meeting in Hawaii.

<p><span>"The signing of this master agreement marks a major milestone in the official commitment to and formalization of this global collaboration, ensuring that the TMT project is on schedule and progressing smoothly," said Henry Yang, Chair of the TMT Collaborative Board. "We have been working towards this moment for a long time and this is a special day for astronomy's next-generation observatory."</span></p>
<p><span>The master agreement brings together the TMT partners for the purpose of developing, designing, financing, constructing, commissioning, operating and decommissioning a next-generation, thirty-meter-class astronomical observatory.</span></p>
<p><span>"In simple terms, the Hubble Space Telescope brought the universe ten times closer than existing ground telescopes in the 1970's and 1980's, and TMT will bring the universe twelve times closer than that," said UCSC astronomer Sandra Faber, interim director of the University of California Observatories (UCO), which oversees UC's participation in TMT.</span></p>
<p><span>"We are pleased with this vote of confidence from the scientific authorities," said Edward Stone, vice chair of the TMT Board. "Their signing of this Master Agreement is a key endorsement of TMT's scientific merits as well as the project's overall implementation plan."</span></p>
<p><span>Looking ahead, the next step will be for the financial authorities of the partners to similarly sign the document and finalize the funding plan.</span></p>
<p><span>"With the scientific authorities now all on board, we welcome and look forward to the critical support of the remaining financial authorities in advancing the TMT project," said Yang.</span></p>
<p><span>2013 has been a busy and successful year for TMT, and the signing of the master agreement is a major step forward in the creation of a revolutionary astronomical facility. Construction of TMT is planned to begin in April 2014 and TMT is scheduled to begin scientific operations in 2022 on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.</span></p>

<br/>
This year, two prominent members of the Dickens family will come to Santa Cruz for another event honoring Mr. Dickens.&#160;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Gerald Dickens, the great-great-grandson, and Lucinda Dickens Hawksley, the great-great-great-granddaughter of Dickens, will speak and perform as part of the annual <a href="http://dickens.ucsc.edu/">Dickens Universe</a> program, running August 4-10 on the UC Santa Cruz campus.<br/>
<br/>
Sponsored by the <a href="http://dickens.ucsc.edu/">Dickens Project</a>, an international research group headquartered at UCSC, the Dickens Universe brings together scholars, teachers, and members of the general public for a week of talks, classes, and festive events centered around the works of Dickens.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;This year, the program will focus on two novels, <em>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</em>, left unfinished when Dickens died suddenly in 1870, and <em>The Moonstone</em> by Dickens's friend Wilkie Collins, often considered the first detective novel in English,&#8221; noted UCSC literature professor and Dickens Project director, John Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
Jordan said that on Tuesday evening, August 6, Gerald Dickens will present a dramatic reading from Dickens' works, &#8220;including selections from some of his best-loved novels and featuring the little-known story "Doctor Marigold's Prescriptions."<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Mr. Dickens has appeared on stages around the world wherever the novels of Dickens are being discussed,&#8221; Jordan added.<br/>
<br/>
On Thursday afternoon, August 8, author and art historian Lucinda Dickens Hawksley will present a talk about her family&#8217;s history.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Ms. Hawksley is a well-known lecturer and author, who has written widely about Dickens, including most recently, a biography of Dickens's daughter Kate,&#8221; Jordan noted.</p>
<p>For the past decade, she has also been a Patron of the Charles Dickens Museum in London. She is additionally the author of a recent bicentenary edition of <em>Charles Dickens</em>, a biographical book containing facsimiles ranging from letters and manuscripts, to Dickens's will.</p>
<p>Although these special appearances are free to enrolled participants in the weeklong Dickens Universe, members of the public may also attend and get a taste of the Dickens Universe by contacting the project office at (831) 459-2103 and donating a minimum of $50 to the Friends of the Dickens Project. These seats are limited.</p>

<p>A popular speaker, Murayama is an expert in the theory of elementary particle interactions, including the mysterious nature of dark matter in the universe. He is a professor of physics at UC Berkeley and director of the Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (IPMU) at the University of Tokyo.</p>
<p>The universe was once much smaller than the size of an atom. Small things mattered in the small universe, where quantum physics dominated the scene. In his talk, Murayama will address fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and discuss the efforts of physicists to solve remaining major puzzles.</p>
<p>"He is one of the very best science communicators that I have ever known," said Young-Kee Kim, deputy director of Fermilab. "He has the incredible ability of energizing and exciting the public all the way from elementary school students and graduate students to senior citizens."</p>
<p>Murayama's public talk is part of the biennial meeting of the Division of Particles and Fields of the <a href="http://www.aps.org/">American Physical Society</a> (APS), which is being held this year at UC Santa Cruz from August 13 through 17. The meeting is hosted by the <a href="http://scipp.ucsc.edu/">Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics</a> (SCIPP) at UCSC. This meeting brings together junior and senior researchers from across the many disciplines related to particle physics.</p>

(Photo by P. Madau)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>NSF-funded 'Hyades' supercomputer is paired with a Huawei UDS petabyte storage system for data archiving and sharing</article-subhead><article-text><p>State-of-the-art computer systems have been instrumental in making UC Santa Cruz one of the world's leading centers for computational astrophysics and planetary science. A new supercomputer recently installed on campus provides an order of magnitude improvement in the ability of researchers to address fundamental questions in cosmology and astrophysics. Its value is further enhanced by a high-capacity data storage system for archiving and sharing the results of astrophysical simulations.</p>
<p>The powerful new "Hyades" supercomputer will be used by UCSC researchers to simulate phenomena such as exploding stars, black holes, magnetic fields, planet formation, the evolution of galaxies, and how structure emerged in the cosmos after the big bang. The $1.5 million machine was funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Major Research Instrumentation grant of $910,000, augmented by campus contributions and favorable deals from vendors such as Dell and Intel.</p>
<p>Paired with the supercomputer is a Huawei Universal Distributed Storage (UDS) system that provides one petabyte of high-performance storage capacity. The Huawei UDS cloud storage system, on loan to the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/03/storage-systems.html">Center for Research in Storage Systems</a> (CRSS) at the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>, is expected to become one of the largest repositories of astrophysical data outside of national facilities. Shawfeng Dong, scientist and computing cluster administrator for the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, oversaw the installation and integration of the Hyades supercomputer and Huawei storage system.</p>
<p>Piero Madau, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and principal investigator on the NSF grant, said, "Hyades is more than ten times better than our previous machine, and with the Huawei system providing storage for our simulation results, we can maximize the value of those results by making them available to the astrophysics community."</p>
<p>Joel Primack, professor of physics at UCSC and director of the <a href="http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/">UC High-Performance AstroComputing Center</a> (UC-HiPACC), explained that supercomputer simulations can generate such huge amounts of complex data that it becomes difficult to analyze them on the fly. An enormous amount of storage capacity is needed for the output of these simulations so that the results can be studied and shared with other researchers.</p>
<p>"The Huawei system will be used to store our astrophysics results, not only from Hyades but also from simulations that we run at the big national supercomputing facilities, such as at NASA Ames or Oak Ridge National Laboratory," Primack said. "Those facilities can only store the results for a limited time, and they also restrict access to them. Now, with the Huawei storage system, we can put our results on a local server."</p>
<p>The <a href="http://tasc.ucsc.edu/">Theoretical Astrophysics at Santa Cruz</a> (TASC) computational astrophysics group includes about 20 faculty and at least 50 postdoctoral researchers and graduate students in four departments: Applied Math and Statistics, Astronomy and Astrophysics, Earth and Planetary Sciences, and Physics. In addition, computer scientists at the CRSS will be studying the performance of the new Huawei UDS system. Huawei is among the industry sponsors of CRSS, an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center supported by NSF.</p>
<p>"We're interested in how scientists store and use big data in a system like Hyades," said CRSS executive director Andy Hospodor. "We have studied other operating environments and are very interested in learning about astrophysical data. Our faculty and students will find ways to improve the performance, reliability, and energy efficiency of such large-scale data systems."</p>
<p>With its petabyte storage capacity, the Huawei system provides an enormous increase in the data storage capabilities of UCSC's computational astrophysics group. Huawei has provided a similar UDS cloud storage system for CERN, the European particle physics lab in Switzerland, to handle data from the Large Hadron Collider. UDS enables storage and sharing of big data on its mass object-based storage infrastructure, which employs high-density and energy-saving storage nodes based on ARM architecture, intelligently adjusts the workload at each node, and grows evenly with each capacity expansion.</p>
<p>The new Hyades supercomputer is much more powerful than the one it replaces (called Pleiades), but it occupies the same space and uses the same power in the UCSC data center. Hyades features 376 Intel Sandy Bridge Xeon CPUs (3008 x86_64 cores in total), 8 Nvidia K20 GPU computing accelerators, 3 Intel Xeon Phi 5110P accelerators, and 13 terabytes of memory. It has a peak speed of 60 teraflops (a teraflop is one trillion floating-point operations per second).</p>
<p>This mid-size high-performance computing system will support cutting-edge science and the training of the next generation of computational astrophysicists. It also enables researchers to hone their tools for high-resolution three-dimensional simulations run on much larger systems off campus. By demonstrating the efficiency of their codes on campus facilities, UCSC faculty successfully compete for time on some of the world's most powerful machines, such as those owned by NSF, NASA, and the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>"Having a local computing cluster is very important for developing the code to run on these supercomputers. They're hard to program, and having a local machine gives us a big leg up," Primack said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/09/bolshoi-simulation.html</url><title>Scientists release most accurate simulation of the universe to date</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/08/eris-simulation.html</url><title>Astrophysicists report first simulation to create a Milky Way-like galaxy</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/03/storage-systems.html</url><title>UCSC and industry partners launch center for data storage research</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3189137980727046587bc9a9d1918469"><name>moore-agu</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Earth scientist Casey Moore elected fellow of the American Geophysical Union</title><summary>AGU fellows are a select group of distinguished scientists who have made exceptional scientific contributions in the field of Earth science.</summary><keywords>Casey Moore, J.

</strong></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has received three grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to support humanities projects in the Literature Department.</p>
<p>The campus awards are part of $33 million in grants for 173 humanities projects that the NEH has funded this year.</p>
<p>Literature Professor Karen Bassi received $200,000 to support a four-week National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Institute for 25 college and university faculty to investigate the history of mortality in ancient Greek culture.</p>
<p>The Institute is designed to bring college and university teachers together with graduate students and experts in relevant fields to examine material from a broad range of ancient Greek literary sources, visual and archaeological remains, and historical periods.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The goal of the Institute is to collectively develop a multi-disciplinary history of mortality in ancient Greece, as the prospects of fearing, facing, and evading death can be found in scholarship throughout ancient Greek culture--including literature, philosophy, religion, art history, the history of medicine, and archaeology.<br/>
<br/>
The project will take place in Athens, Greece during the summer of 2014.<br/>
<br/>
Bassi received her BA in Classics from UCSC in 1980 and her Ph.D. in Classics from Brown University in 1987. She has taught at UCSC since 1989 as professor of Classics and Literature. Bassi also served as chair of the Literature Department from 2008 to 2012, director of the Classics program, and director of the Educational Abroad Program in the Netherlands.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Literature professor and Dickens Project director</strong> John Jordan received NEH grants for two seminars that will take place prior to the 2014 Dickens Universe, the annual UCSC literary celebration of the works of Charles Dickens.<br/>
<br/>
He was awarded $118,912 for a four-week NEH seminar for 16 college and university faculty to explore two of Charles Dickens's novels and their theatrical and cinematic adaptations.<br/>
<br/>
Titled &#8220;Performing Dickens: The Theatrical Context of <em>Oliver Twist</em> and <em>Great Expectations</em> on Page, Stage and Screen,&#8221; this seminar will be led by Professor Sharon Weltman of Louisiana State University.<br/>
<br/>
The seminar will examine two of Dickens&#8217;s most often taught and most frequently adapted novels, along with a range of major film, television, and dramatic adaptations from 1837 to 2012.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The seminar will place Dickens in a theatrical context, discussing his many connections to the stage,&#8221; said Jordan. &#8220;It will explore both the theater&#8217;s profound effect on his art (he wrote while acting out his characters in front of a mirror) and his vital effect on Victorian performance practice (through collaboration with playwrights and wildly successful reading tours).&#8221;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;College and university teachers of literature, theater, film, performance, and adaptation studies will benefit from this seminar on performing Dickens as they work on their own related projects,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jordan also was awarded $112,594</strong> for a four-week seminar for 16 elementary, middle and high school teachers on the literary and film adaptations of Charles Dickens's novels <em>Great Expectations</em> and <em>A Christmas Carol</em><br/>
<br/>
Focused on a cluster of films and narrative rewritings of these two major novels, the "Great Adaptations" seminar will explore the enduring influence of Dickens on the modern imagination.<br/>
<br/>
"A major goal of the seminar will be to help teachers identify new ways to use adaptation in the classroom in order to engage students actively in thinking and writing about literature. Examples will be drawn from a variety of genres, including fiction, film, and drama,&#8221; Jordan noted.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Titled &#8220;Great Adaptations: Dickens in Literature and Film,&#8221; this seminar will be led by Professor Marty Gould of the University of South Florida.<br/>

<p>Published in <a href="http://www.politico.com/">Politico</a> today, the <a href="http://www.innovationdeficit.org/">letter</a> asked the nation's leaders to close an &#8220;innovation deficit&#8221; that has resulted from a reduction in funding to U.S. universities at a time when other nations are increasing their higher education investments.</p>
<p>Chancellor Blumenthal and fellow university leaders wrote in the letter that closing the innovation deficit &#8211; the widening gap between needed and actual investments in research and education &#8211; must be a national imperative. The higher education leaders noted that research and higher education investments lead to the types of innovation and new technologies that power the nation&#8217;s economy, create jobs and reduce the budget deficit &#8212; while ensuring that the U.S. maintains its role as global leader.</p>
<p>In the past year, Blumenthal has authored several published op-eds on the subject. In a post today on his <a href="http://chancellor.ucsc.edu/blog/index.html">blog</a>, the chancellor wrote, "We need to take the long view, recognizing that these investments pay off over decades. We are still reaping the dividends of investments made in the 1960s, when California made funding public higher education a priority, and the federal government invested heavily in research, graduate education, and discovery, much of it linked to the space program."</p>
<p>The 165 university leaders who signed the letter today warned that failing to deal with the innovation deficit &#8220;will pass to future generations the burdens of lost leadership in innovation, economic decline, and limited job opportunities."</p>
<p>"We call upon you to reject unsound budget cuts and recommit to strong and sustained investments in research and education," they added. "Only then can we ensure that our nation&#8217;s promise of a better tomorrow endures.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than half of U.S. economic growth since World War II is the result of technological innovation, much of which results from federally funded scientific research conducted at U.S. universities. The university leaders pointed out that university research has led to life-saving vaccines, lasers, MRI, touchscreens, GPS, the Internet and many other advances that have improved lives and generated entire new sectors in the economy.</p>
<p>China, Singapore and South Korea have dramatically increased their investments in research and higher education over the past two decades after observing how those kinds of investments have benefited the U.S. economy, the letter said. China, Singapore and South Korea have had two to four times the U.S. rate of growth in research and development investment during that period.</p>
<p>Congress faces critical budget decisions in the coming months, with annual funding bills, the debt limit, and measures to eliminate or modify deep, across-the-board spending cuts forced by sequestration.</p>
<p>The university presidents and chancellors noted in their letter that targeted investments in research and higher education should be made regardless of overall funding levels because they would be key sources of long-term economic growth and fiscal stability.</p>
<p>Because the innovation deficit undermines economic growth, it harms our nation&#8217;s overall fiscal health, worsening long-term budget deficits and debt,&#8221; the letter said. &#8220;Investments in research and education are not inconsistent with long-term deficit reduction; they are vital to it.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4119f44a80727046587bc9a936bd0103"><name>anatomical-donation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Informational Notice: Anatomical Donation/Materials Programs Policy</title><summary>The University invites non-represented employees to comment on the revised, system-wide Anatomical Donation/Materials Programs policy.</summary><start-date>1375430400000</start-date><display-name>Informational Notice: Anatomical Donation/Materials Programs Policy</display-name><path>/2013/07/anatomical-donation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/07/anatomical-donation</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1375481754633</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1375481754633</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>The University invites non-represented employees to comment on the revised, system-wide <em>Anatomical Donation/Materials Programs</em> policy.&#160; The revised policy describes the University&#8217;s commitment to ensure anatomical materials are effectively managed and that UC&#8217;s anatomical donation programs maintain public confidence and advance the University&#8217;s education and research enterprise.&#160;&#160;</span> <span></span>
