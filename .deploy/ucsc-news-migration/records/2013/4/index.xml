UC Santa Cruz Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports announces the new Sammy Slug Summer Camp, a recreational summer program for boys and girls entering 1st through 5th grades.<br/>
<br/>
Using the UCSC campus as our playground, activities may include team sports, individual sports, swim, dance, martial arts, hiking and exploration, and more. The goal is to provide a safe, active, and affordable alternative to a stale and sedentary summer.<br/>
<br/>
Experienced recreation professionals are designing the camp which will be staffed by UCSC students. With a focus on safety, all staff will be screened through a criminal background check, certified in First Aid/CPR, and trained in safe practices.<br/>
<br/>
The focus is on fun, with staff trained on age-appropriate activities, motivational strategies, and over-the-top enthusiasm! The camp will be offered in one-week sessions in July and August with half-day, full-day, pre-camp and post-camp offerings.<br/>
<br/>
Online registration through Activenet begins Monday, April 1st. There is also a mail-in registration option.

Her name is Ronan, and she's a California sea lion at Long Marine Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Scientists at the lab trained Ronan to bob her head in time with rhythmic sounds, then showed that she could transfer this skill to tempos and music she hadn't heard before.</p>
<p>Ronan is the first non-human mammal convincingly shown to be able to keep the beat. Scientists call it "rhythmic entrainment," and aside from humans it was previously seen only in parrots and other birds with a talent for vocal mimicry. Ronan's sense of rhythm undercuts an increasingly influential theory that beat keeping requires a capacity for complex vocal learning, according to Peter Cook, a graduate student in psychology at UC Santa Cruz and first author of the study, published online April 1, 2013 in the <a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/com-128-2-1.pdf"><em>Journal of Comparative Psychology</em></a>.</p>
<p>Sea lions have limited flexibility in the sounds they make, and they are not known to be capable of vocal mimicry. "Ronan's success poses a real problem for the theory that vocal mimicry is a necessary precondition for rhythmic entrainment," Cook said.</p>
<p><strong>Internet sensation<br/> </strong></p>
<p>That theory had gained support from two 2009 studies inspired by a sulfur-crested cockatoo named Snowball, who became an Internet sensation after his owner posted a video of <a href="http://youtu.be/N7IZmRnAo6s">Snowball dancing to the Backstreet Boys</a>. Researchers intrigued by the video had conducted a rigorous search for more dancing-animal videos and found that, at least on YouTube, parrots and their relatives accounted for almost every apparent case of beat keeping.</p>
<p>"The idea was that beat keeping is a fortuitous side effect of adaptations for vocal mimicry, which requires matching incoming auditory signals with outgoing vocal behavior," Cook said. "It's understandable why that theory was attractive. But the fact is our sea lion has gotten really good at keeping the beat. Our finding represents a cautionary note for an idea that was really starting to take hold in the field of comparative psychology."</p>
<p>Born in the wild in 2008, Ronan was rescued by the <a href="http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/">Marine Mammal Center</a> in Sausalito in 2009 after she was found on Highway 1 in San Luis Obispo County. It was her third stranding incident, and she didn't seem to be making it in the wild. She came to Long Marine Lab in January 2010 and joined the <a href="http://pinnipedlab.ucsc.edu/">Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Laboratory</a> directed by one of Cook's advisers at UCSC, animal behaviorist Colleen Reichmuth.</p>
<p>At first, the beat-keeping study was a side project for both Ronan and Cook. Ronan had originally served as a healthy control in Cook's primary research project, which focuses on the cognitive effects of a neurotoxin produced by certain algae found along the California coast. During blooms of the algae, the toxin enters the food chain and sometimes causes mass strandings of sea lions. Many of the affected animals end up at the Marine Mammal Center for rehabilitation, where Cook collaborates with the staff to study the effects of the neurotoxin, using a mixture of brain imaging and behavioral approaches.</p>
<p><strong>'Particularly bright sea lion'</strong></p>
<p>The idea to use Ronan in a study of beat keeping was spurred partly by her facility for rapid learning. "From my first interactions with her, it was clear that Ronan was a particularly bright sea lion," Cook said. "Everybody in the animal cognition world, including me, was intrigued by the dancing bird studies, but I remember thinking that no one had attempted a strong effort to show beat keeping in an animal other than a parrot. I figured training a mammal to move in time to music would be hard, but Ronan seemed like an ideal subject."</p>
<p>Working mostly on weekends, Cook and research technician Andrew Rouse began training Ronan to bob her head to a beat, starting with simple rhythm tracks. It took a few months before she was reliably keeping the beat, but once she had mastered it, Ronan showed a remarkable ability to keep time to novel rhythmic tempos and music. Currently, her favorite track seems to be Earth Wind &amp; Fire's "Boogie Wonderland."</p>
<p>"Given her success at keeping the beat with new rhythm tracks and songs following her initial training, it's possible that keeping the beat isn't that hard for her," Cook said. "She just had to learn what it was we wanted her to do."</p>
<p>Although parrots may show a greater inclination for this behavior without explicit training, Cook noted that it is not clear whether birds like Snowball started dancing spontaneously. Cockatoos and other parrots are long-lived, highly social birds known to bond closely with their human keepers. "Some of these parrots are not intentionally trained, but they do have decades of complex interaction with humans," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Better than birds</strong></p>
<p>Cook also noted that the well-trained Ronan performs much better than the birds at staying on the beat. "In the videos, Alex [an African gray parrot] and Snowball fall off the beat a lot. They&#8217;re good at finding the tempo in music, but don&#8217;t seem to maintain the behavior as reliably as Ronan. She stays right on the beat," he said.</p>
<p>Cook is working with Margaret Wilson, an associate professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz, to explore the implications of the new findings. Scientists once thought that the underpinnings of musical ability were unique to humans. The recent demonstrations of entrainment in parrots have challenged that, but only in a limited way, leading to the idea that specializations for vocal mimicry might be necessary for the ability to move in time with a heard rhythm. This theory cannot, however, account for beat keeping in Ronan, a non-mimic. Wilson and Cook argue that the brain mechanisms needed for beat keeping may be widespread in the animal kingdom.&#160;</p>
<p>"Human musical ability may in fact have foundations that are shared with animals," Cook said. "People have assumed that animals lack these abilities. In some cases, people just hadn't looked."</p>
<p>Cook, Rouse, Wilson, and Reichmuth are all coauthors of the new paper. Rouse was a UCSC undergraduate when he began working at the Pinniped Lab, earning a B.S. in biology in 2011. This research was supported by an award from the Packard Endowment for Ocean Sciences at UCSC and a National Science Foundation Graduate Student Fellowship to Peter Cook. The Pinniped Lab works with Ronan under National Marine Fisheries Service permit #14535.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/com-128-2-1.pdf</url><title>Article in the Journal of Comparative Psychology</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://ims.ucsc.edu/index.html</url><title>UCSC Institute of Marine Sciences</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://pinnipedlab.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UCSC Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Laboratory</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c73296418072704645e59c14e597ce09"><name>elaine-kihara-dedication</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Elaine Kihara: Immeasurable dedication toward students </title><summary>Oakes College academic preceptor named 2013 recipient of Outstanding Staff Award&#13;

It took him years to pay off his debt.</p>
<p>Kihara&#8217;s father, Hayato, was forced from his studies at UC Berkeley and into a Japanese internment camp. Eventually, he earned his doctorate in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and spent most of his career heading a research lab at the former Pacific State Hospital in Pomona, Calif.</p>
<p>Those family stories of hardship and perseverance are part of what drives Kihara, an academic preceptor at Oakes College. It&#8217;s also part of the reason the step-grandmother of six was named this year&#8217;s recipient of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Outstanding Staff Award. Her colleagues say this descendant of immigrants is wise, thoughtful, and compassionate &#8212; especially toward those who are working to be the first in their family to get a college degree.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are the child of immigrants, you know there is a lot of hope in you; that people are depending on your success,&#8221; says the soft-spoken 58-year-old. At the same time, there may be cultural pressure to quit school and work in the family business or help parents out of financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Kihara makes it her job to help students navigate that tricky push-pull.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe everyone should get the best education possible,&#8221; says Kihara. &#8220;These students have so much potential, I want them to get as much as they can out of college.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sitting in her bright, art-studded office, Kihara recalls 20-plus years of students sitting nervously next to her desk or flopping onto her comfortable couch to recount problems they face. They tell stories of the death of a parent, of looming foreclosures, of sudden illnesses. They tell of 30-hour work weeks that make it hard to study or of facing another year of college because budget cuts made it impossible to get the classes they need for their major. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our job is to help students problem-solve and think of options,&#8221; says Kihara, noting current students are facing the quadruple-burden of a weak job market, an insecure economy, rising tuition, and university belt-tightening. It&#8217;s an anxious time.</p>
<p>On busy days, 18 students may come through Kihara&#8217;s door, often needing her deep understanding of university policy and procedure to get them out of tough situations. Once, she was called upon to help arrange the quick transfer of a student who suddenly became the caregiver for her siblings after her mother and sister were murdered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elaine&#8217;s dedication toward students&#8217; success is immeasurable; she goes above and beyond to help students get where they need to be,&#8221; says Marie Yoo, an academic preceptor at Stevenson College.</p>
<p>Says Oakes Provost Kimberly Lau: &#8220;She (Kihara) is respected and beloved because of her openness, her sincerity, and her genuine respect for others. If Oakes were a sports team, Elaine would be voted &#8216;most valuable player&#8217; by outsiders and elected team captain by insiders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kihara smiles when she talks of being honored by the university and her colleagues.&#8220;I wish my parents were alive because they would have liked it that I got an award for working hard. They would have been proud of me.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Elaine Kihara will receive a commemorative plaque from Chancellor Blumenthal at the Staff Appreciation Picnic. The annual event will take place at the East Field on Wednesday, May 22.<br/>

href="http://tupelohassman.com/"><strong>Tupelo Hassman</strong></a>--author of the novel <em>Girlchild</em>--will kick off the spring installment of UCSC&#8217;s <em><strong><a href="http://creativewriting.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/living-writers-reading-series.html">Living Writers reading series</a></strong></em>, Thursday, April 4, at the Humanities Lecture Hall.<br/>
<br/>
As the <em>New York Times</em> has noted:</p>
<p><em>"It takes real talent to make something beautiful out of a trailer park. &#8216;Girlchild,&#8217;&#160;Tupelo Hassman&#8217;s lacerating debut novel, is the story of Rory Dawn Hendrix, a young girl growing up in the Calle, a cluster of mobile homes on a plot of dust outside Reno, Nevada. Ms. Hassman is such a poised storyteller that her prose practically struts. Her words are as elegant as they are fierce."</em><br/>
<br/>
Hassman&#8212;who lives in San Francisco's East Bay-- was the first American ever to win <a href="http://www.literarydeathmatch.com/">London's Literary Death Match</a>, and her work has appeared in venues ranging from the the <em>Boston Globe</em> to the internationally noted literary magazine, <em>ZYZZYVA</em>.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The spring series is a dynamic mix of exciting new writers who've just published their first novels, like <strong>Justin Torres</strong>, <strong>Tupelo Hassman</strong>, and <strong>Patrick DeWitt,</strong> and long established writers such as <strong>Elizabeth Graver</strong> and <strong>Karen Joy Fowler</strong>,&#8221; noted Micah Perks, professor of literature and co-director of the UCSC Creative Writing Program.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Our theme, &#8216;Miraculous Children,&#8217; celebrates the fact that all children are miraculous in astonishing and surprising ways--from the tough, wounded children in Torres&#8217; and Hassman's novels, to the child that cannot go out into the sun in Elizabeth Graver's <em>Awake</em>, to the girl who grows up in a biological experiment in Karen Joy Fowler's <em>We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Fowler, who will read on May 2, is the author of six novels and three short story collections.&#160;Her novel <em>The Jane Austen Book Club</em>&#160;spent 13 weeks on the&#160;<em>New York Times</em>&#160;bestsellers list and was a <em>New York Times</em>&#160;Notable Book. Fowler&#8217;s previous novel,&#160;<em>Sister Noon</em>, was a finalist for the 2001 PEN/Faulkner Award for fiction.<br/>
<br/>
Perks added the lineup also includes <strong>George Estreich</strong>, author of a raw, honest and poetic memoir about raising a daughter with down's syndrome; and <strong>Patrick DeWitt</strong>, who penned a hilarious, heartbreaking western, <em>The Sisters Brothers</em>, where two gunslingers seek their fortunes, but find a way home instead.<br/>
<br/>
The <em>Los Angeles Times</em> has said of DeWitt, &#8220;If Cormac McCarthy had a sense of humor, he might have concocted a story like Patrick DeWitt&#8217;s bloody, darkly funny western.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The spring series will also showcase three of UCSC&#8217;s own graduate students in literature--Tsering Wangmo, Lauren Shufran, and Juliana Leslie&#8212;all published, prize winning poets.<br/>
<br/>
Perks noted that the UC Presidential Chair in Feminist Critical Race and Ethnic Studies at UCSC is additionally co-sponsoring a visit from esteemed UCSC alumnus <strong>Brenda Shaughnessy</strong> on April 25.<br/>
<br/>
The <em>New Yorker</em> has described&#160; Shaughnessy's third book of poems, <em>Our Andromeda</em>, as a "monumental work."&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Now living in Brooklyn, Shaughnessy is currently poetry editor-at-large at&#160;<em>Tin House Magazine</em>. Her poems have appeared in<em>&#160;Harpers, McSweeney&#8217;s, The Nation, The New Yorker, The Paris Review</em>, and <em>Slate.com</em>.<br/>
<br/>
All of the readings take place on Thursday evenings at 6 p.m. in the Humanities Lecture Hall on the UCSC campus. Admission is free, and open to the public.<br/>
<br/>

William Domhoff when the <a href="http://urbanaffairsassociation.org/conference/conference2013/">Urban Affairs Association</a> holds its 43rd annual conference this week in San Francisco.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
The session, "Who Rules American Cities?: Reflections on the Contributions of G. William Domhoff to the Understanding of Urban Power Structures," is set for Friday, April 5 at 2:05 p.m. In his landmark book, <em>Who Rules America?</em>,&#160; first published in 1967 and frequently updated, Domhoff presents original and detailed information on how power and politics operate in the United States. A seventh edition will be published in May. <br/>
<br/>
The Urban Affairs Association is the international professional organization for urban scholars, researchers, and public service professionals. Its meeting begins Wednesday, April 3 and runs through Saturday at the Fairmont Hotel. <br/>
<br/>
Domhoff is a pioneer UCSC faculty member, joining the campus in 1965. He retired in 1994 and has continued his research into power structures along with new research in another field, dreams. He will <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/03/ucsc-teach-in-feature-story.html">speak on dream research</a> later this month during Alumni Weekend. <br/>
<br/>
In 2009, he co-authored <em>The Leftmost City: Power and Progressive Politics in Santa Cruz</em> (Westview Press). A synopsis of that book and details on his other power structure research can be found at <a href="http://www.whorulesamerica.net">www.whorulesamerica.net</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Most recently, Domhoff has been writing on how urban power structures shaped national urban policy as one part of his new study of power in America from the 1930s to the present. His research is set to appear in <em>The Myth of Liberal Ascendancy: Corporate Dominance From The Great Depression to the Great Recession</em>, scheduled to be published in May by Paradigm Publishers. <br/>

<div></div></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The walls of this classroom are lined with feathery California coastal sage and noxious poison oak. Bobcat, coyote, and skunk wander its floors while raptors soar overhead and waves can nearly drown out conversation.</p>
<p>But none of the UC Santa Cruz students at Younger Lagoon Reserve minds. In fact, it&#8217;s the plants and animals that bring them to this postage-stamp-sized parcel of wilderness. Here, they sharpen their minds while they get their hands dirty: learning, researching, and making a difference too.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is such a beautiful place,&#8221; says Corinne Pope (Stevenson '14, ecology and evolutionary biology) pausing as she plants rush and lizard&#8217;s tail seedlings in the reserve&#8217;s dark soil. She and other UCSC interns are restoring native grasses and shrubs in what was once a Brussels sprouts field &#8212; work that may someday change restoration efforts at other California sites. &#8220;I feel like I&#8217;m really contributing something,&#8221; Pope says.</p>
<p>The Younger Lagoon Reserve came to UCSC in 1972, and became a classroom and research site in 1981. Its 72 acres consist of a brackish Y-shaped lagoon dotted with birds, driftwood-scattered sand dunes, and a coastal terrace, which was purchased by UCSC in 1999 and lies adjacent to a mobile home park. More than 100 migratory and resident bird species have been counted here, along with deer, bobcat, mice and brush rabbits &#8212; and even a few snakes.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;A wild place right on the edge of town,&#8221; is how Younger Lagoon Reserve Manager Beth Howard (Kresge, 2001, environmental studies and biology) describes it. It&#8217;s that proximity, she says, that allows UCSC students from a variety of disciplines to do fieldwork and be back in the classroom the same day.</p>
<p>Tim Brown (Porter, 2010, environmental studies), restoration steward for Younger Lagoon Reserve, sits at a weathered picnic table ticking off the learning activities hundreds of undergraduates pursue here every year. Students take water samples, write field notes, dip-net the lagoon for invertebrates, and use scientific equipment. Sometimes, he&#8217;ll lead tracking expeditions where he&#8217;ll let students follow the wandering paw prints of domestic dogs and then compare those to the purposeful trail of a coyote. It&#8217;s a transformative lesson in nature for many. Meanwhile, graduate students pursue research on subjects like monomethylmercury formation, groundwater movement, and coyote diet too.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all about teaching and research,&#8221; Howard says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We call it our living laboratory,&#8221; Brown adds.</p>
<p>One of the largest projects at the reserve involves up to 50 students each year in the work of restoring the former sprouts field to a rich and diverse coastal prairie. Brown and Howard direct these interns as they gather seeds like California oat grass and meadow barley from seven local coastal-prairie sites each year. Then, students clean the seeds, propagate them in a greenhouse on campus, and finally plant them in the soil.&#160;&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s messy and it&#8217;s creative. A lot of ingenuity comes into play,&#8221; says Brown of students adapting things like pasta strainers and sieves into seed cleaners. Brown gives a quick grin. &#8220;You get in touch with your ancestors. You get your hunter-gatherer on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Students also are participating in a large research project to discover more effective restoration methods &#8212; including strategies for getting rid of non-native weeds.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our applied research experiments on restoring coastal habitats give students an opportunity to gain research experience and, at the same time, inform local management practices,&#8221; said Karen Holl, chair of the Environmental Studies Department. Earlier this year, she gave talks to land managers across the state on those techniques used at the reserve.</p>
<p>For Mickie Tang (Oakes, 2013, ecology and evolutionary biology) the restoration and research work at the reserve has changed her life&#8217;s direction. Standing amid flats of seedlings and buffeted by an ocean breeze, Tang says she discovered she likes asking questions and then finding the answer herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I wanted to be a researcher until I came here,&#8221; she says.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d24d7c0e8072704645e59c146756e103"><name>gopher-control</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gopher control workshop set for Saturday, April 6 at UCSC Farm</title><summary>Learn how to get gopher problems under control at a workshop Saturday, April 6 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the UC Santa Cruz Farm. </summary><start-date>1365032880000</start-date><display-name>Gopher control</display-name><path>/2013/04/gopher-control</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/gopher-control</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1365032926152</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1365033669910</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title></title><phone/><email>mtbrown@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/gophers-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/gophers-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gophers-80.jpg</name><display-name>gophers-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>18579</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Do brown mounds of fresh earth get you down?</p>
<p>Are your carefully tended flowers and vegetables drooping or disappearing? Learn how to get gopher problems under control at a workshop taught by Thomas Wittman, founder and owner of Gophers Limited. The workshop takes place on Saturday, April 6 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Louise Cain Gatehouse on the UC Santa Cruz Farm. The workshop will be held rain or shine.&#160;</p>
<p>Wittman specializes in non-toxic techniques for controlling burrowing rodent pests. During the workshop he&#8217;ll discuss and demonstrate a range of solutions for dealing with gophers, moles, voles, and ground squirrels. &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk about wire baskets, fencing, and other exclusion options,&#8221; says Wittman. &#8220;I&#8217;ll also discuss liquid drenches, &#8216;urban myths&#8217; like the legendary Juicy Fruit remedy, sound makers, pyrotechnics including the Rodenator explosive wand, and many kinds of trapping techniques.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Following the lecture, Wittman will demonstrate the use of Cinch traps, the easiest and most effective way to control gophers and moles with a trap. Traps and plant protection baskets will be available for sale at the event.</p>
<p>Cost of the workshop is $30 general admission, $20 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, and $5 for UCSC students. Pre-register at <a href="http://gopher.bpt.me">http://gopher.bpt.me</a> or pay at the door with cash or check the day of the event.</p>

<br/>
In a study published this week in the journal <em>Nature</em>, Ravelo and co-authors report that temperature patterns during Earth's last prolonged global "hot spell"--the Pliocene, some 5.3 to 2.6 million years ago--differed dramatically from those of modern times.<br/>
<br/>
The researchers compiled records of sea surface temperatures going back five million years, to the early Pliocene. The records reveal a world with fairly uniform warm temperatures in the whole of the Tropics prior to 4 million years ago &#8212; a significant scenario that typical climate model simulations fail to show.<br/>
<br/>
"If we want to understand our future climate, we have to be able to understand the climate of the past," said lead author Alexey Fedorov from Yale University.<br/>
<br/>
The researchers say other factors must be considered besides a build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Their findings are based on an analysis of ocean floor sediments collected by drilling into the ocean floor.<br/>
<br/>
Other authors include Zhonghui Liu of the University of Hong Kong, Petra Dekens of San Francisco State University, Chris Brierley of the University College London, and Kira Lawrence of Lafayette College.<br/>

<p>Since 1977, the Arboretum has been providing gardeners with new, colorful, and unusual plants for creating dynamic central coast gardens. Many of the selections available at the sale are normally hard to find. This year's spring sale will feature some of the newest treasures from the UCSC Arboretum.</p>
<p>The Arboretum's sale is held in conjunction with the spring plant sale of the California Native Plant Society (CNPS). Both sales are open early (from 10 a.m. to noon) to members of the Arboretum Associates and CNPS, and to the general public from noon to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Among the Arboretum's offerings this year are plants that may be unfamiliar because they are new introductions, but will eventually become well-known to gardeners, said Stephen McCabe, director of research at the Arboretum. Examples include the winter-blooming <em>Banksia</em> 'Fireworks' with red and yellow on the bottlebrush-like flowers. It is drought tolerant, frost tolerant down to at least 20 degrees, and should do well along the coast as well. Another new one is a perennial with 2-inch, deep purple-blue flowers, a <em>Dampiera trigona</em> called 'Purple Wire.' Both of these were tested at the Arboretum for years and are part of the Koala Blooms Australian Plant Introduction Program.</p>
<p>There will be many other banksias, grevilleas, leucadendrons, proteas, and California native plants. Among the choice natives is the hard-to-find island bush poppy (<em>Dendromecon harfordii</em>) that seems to bloom year-round once established.</p>
<p>A complete list of the plants available at the sale will be posted on the Arboretum's <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">web site</a> on or before April 14. At the sale, cut flowers taped to the plant signs will show what the flowers will look like. The Arboretum will pay the sales tax on all plant sales.</p>
<p>On Sunday, April 14, Rick Flores, curator of the Arboretum's Native Plant Collection, will lead a Native Plant walk at 10 a.m. at the Arboretum entrance, offering a preview of some of the plants that will be for sale the following weekend. Both the Arboretum and the CNPS will have a flowery mix of native plants for sale. Most of the natives are drought tolerant, but some of the CNPS offerings are canyon or riparian plants that can use some supplemental water in summer. As usual, the Arboretum will be offering a range of unusual exotics, including some new ones. The Arboretum's non-native plants are screened to be noninvasive. The two sales present a colorful array of options for spicing up the garden for spring.</p>
<p>For more information, contact the UCSC Arboretum at (831) 427-2998 or visit <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">arboretum.ucsc.edu</a>. The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>04-21-2013</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f53b82cf807270466e0e60c42d519ef3"><name>April-20-information</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Public Safety Alert for April 20</title><summary>This notification is being provided to advise members of the campus community of the potential for disruptions and hazards associated with an unsanctioned gathering known as "4-20" during the afternoon of Saturday, April 20.</summary><start-date>1365494400000</start-date><display-name>Public Safety Alert for April 20</display-name><path>/2013/04/April-20-information</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/April-20-information</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1365618950807</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1365618950807</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>
<div><span>This notification is being&#160;provided to advise members of the campus community, others with valid reasons&#160;for visiting the UC Santa Cruz&#160;campus, and campus neighbors of the potential for&#160;disruptions and hazards associated with an unsanctioned gathering known as "4-20" during the&#160;afternoon of Saturday, April 20. &#160;The nature of the annual gathering may involve a large&#160;number of individuals in or near the Porter Meadow&#160;smoking marijuana, and the&#160;greatest impact is expected between 3 and 6 p.m.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, a large-scale event based on the consumption of marijuana has the potential to impact campus safety. &#160;The fact that this event attracts many unaffiliated people to our campus adds to my concerns.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Among the unaffiliated people that UC Santa Cruz officers contacted at this event in recent years were parents with young children, vendors operating without a permit, and people interested in selling marijuana and other illegal drugs on campus. Last year, our officers even identified a registered sex offender among those present, as well as a runaway juvenile from out of state.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department and local law enforcement will be present again this year, with a priority of addressing public safety needs and providing emergency response.&#160;&#160;Police officers&#160;will conduct enhanced patrols&#160;throughout the day, looking for individuals in possession of and/or using marijuana, alcohol, or other drugs, as well as drivers under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. Rules prohibiting the unpermitted vending of any merchandise, food, or medical marijuana on the campus will also be strictly enforced.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Please respect the rights of&#160;others.&#160;&#160;This unsanctioned event&#160;significantly burdens the operations of the campus.&#160;&#160;It threatens the health and&#160;safety of the community, imposes&#160;unnecessary expenses, and taints the reputation of UC Santa Cruz &#8212; its students,&#160;staff, and faculty.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>As we get closer to April 20, I want to share additional information that may be helpful to campus safety that afternoon:</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; Please remember that all members and guests of the UC&#160;Santa Cruz community are expected to comply with University policy and federal&#160;and&#160;state laws.&#160;&#160;At a minimum,&#160;those smoking or in&#160;possession of marijuana may receive a citation resulting in a $100 fine. Students&#160;who&#160;receive citations may also receive sanctions by the Office of Student&#160;Judicial Affairs.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; Because of this expected&#160;activity, you should anticipate possible disruptions to traffic due to large&#160;groups of people, especially on&#160;the west side of campus, and plan accordingly.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; Campus parking regulations will be strictly enforced.&#160;&#160;Sections of Empire Grade will be&#160;designated as a tow-away zone, and vehicles will&#160;be ticketed and towed at the&#160;owners' expense.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; Traffic and transit flow may be highly impacted&#160;throughout the campus, especially along Empire Grade, and on Heller Drive from&#160;the West&#160;Entrance to McLaughlin Drive. &#160;Traffic diversion measures may be&#160;instituted if needed to alleviate impacted areas.&#160; &#160;If driving a&#160;vehicle, be alert for increased&#160;pedestrian traffic on all roadways.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; Because this activity attracts people who are&#160;unaffiliated with the campus, please make an extra effort to be aware of suspicious&#160;activity &#8212; and please don't hesitate to immediately alert the UC Santa Cruz&#160;Police Department to such activity.&#160;&#160;If you are ever in&#160;doubt, it is always better to ask&#160;authorities to investigate, rather than risking potential harm to you or&#160;someone else. Please call 911&#160;or 831-459-2231.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; Those who live and work in the areas around Family&#160;Student Housing, Porter College, and College Eight are advised that smoke may&#160;remain&#160;in the area throughout the late afternoon.&#160;&#160;Those with children, respiratory problems, or other medical&#160;conditions should use&#160;precautions.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Please&#160;support us in the effort to protect the campus community. &#160;Thank you in advance for your understanding and&#160;cooperation.</span></div>

<br/>
 The award was established in 2011 to support undergraduate students in UCSC's Division of Social Sciences who are passionate about social issues and committed to public service. It honors Gabriel &#8220;Gabe&#8221; Zimmerman (Stevenson, '02, sociology), who died in the January 2011 shooting that killed five others and wounded 13, including Gabrielle Giffords, a U.S. congresswoman representing the Tucson area.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
 Zimmerman served as Giffords' community outreach director and had organized the "congresswoman on the corner" event in Tucson where the shooting occurred.<br/>
<br/>
 Two UCSC alums in San Francisco, moved by Zimmerman's commitment to public service, were the impetus for the scholarship fund that has grown to more than $90,000 with contributions from more than 500 alumni, faculty, staff, community members, and the public. Contributions are still being accepted in hopes of topping the $100,000 level and <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index-2-column.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=780&amp;dids=538">may be made online</a>.<br/>
<br/>
 The alums, Alex Clemens (Porter, '89, international politics) and Jonathan Klein (Merrill, '89, politics) served on the selection committee along with professors Eva Bertram, politics, Mary Beth Pudup, social sciences, and Craig Reinarman, sociology.<br/>
<br/>
 Watts has &#8220;displayed remarkable leadership, a profound sense of social responsibility and remarkable intellectual skills while taking on increasingly challenging projects,&#8221; said Sociology Department chair Ben Crow.<br/>
<br/>
 Watts, a senior who transferred to UCSC from Columbia Community College, said he hoped to continue Zimmerman's legacy and help "his legacy to spread even further."<br/>
<br/>
 In December, he returned from Ghana after a five-month study-abroad program in which he conducted an independent research project in sanitation and waste management while working with a waste management company in Old Fadama, an informal settlement of 100,000 people in Accra.<br/>
<br/>
 Earlier, at UCSC,&#160; he mentored transfer students in writing and research and coordinated the Green Building Campaign of the Student Environmental Center, as well as a course to teach and implement environmental sustainability on campus through the Education for Sustainabie Living Program.<br/>
<br/>
 The Social Sciences Division will honor Watts at an Alumni Reunion event at Stevenson College Sunday, April 28, at 1 p.m. in the Fireside Lounge. Last month, he met members of Zimmerman's family and some of his friends at an event in Santa Cruz. Watts said learning how Zimmerman inspired others "gives me energy and encouragement to do more."<br/>
<br/>
 "I've been busy working as hard as I can, trying to do good things in my time here, so receiving this award recognizing my efforts is an absolute honor," he said.<br/>
<br/>
 Watts said that after graduation this spring, he plans to do some political organizing and grassroots campaigning to raise money and membership for social justice and environmental groups.<br/>

Hood to give keynote address</article-subhead><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/making-institute-3-conversations">Arts Division</a> will present a public event to help in the planning of a groundbreaking new interdisciplinary Institute of the Arts and Sciences on Friday, April 26, from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the University Center&#8217;s Alumni Room.<br/>
<br/>
Titled <strong>Making the Institute: 3 Conversations</strong>, the day-long event will be hosted by UCSC arts dean David Yager and John Weber, the Institute&#8217;s newly-hired founding director.<br/>
<br/>
A reception will take place on the balcony of the Digital Arts Research Center (DARC) building following the panel discussions&#8212;including a special preview of UCSC&#8217;s annual <a href="http://danm.ucsc.edu/ground-ctrl">Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) MFA exhibition</a>&#8212;beginning at 4:30 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
Admission is free, and the community is invited.<br/>
<br/>
The day will begin with a keynote address by <strong>Walter J. Hood</strong>, an award-winning landscape architect and urban designer with an international reputation for his pioneering work in environmental design.<br/>
<br/>
Hood is currently professor of landscape architecture &amp; environmental planning and urban design at UC Berkeley and principal of <a href="http://wjhooddesign.com/">Hood Design</a> in Oakland, CA. His projects are noted for their fusion of design excellence with community-based planning.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;One of the great things about his work is that he tries to build community using space and architecture,&#8221; noted Dean Yager.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It's one of the most important ideas for the Institute&#8212;that the physical space and campus space are both integrated into the concept of art and science.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Hood&#8217;s notable projects include the grounds for the new M. H. de Young Museum in San Francisco in collaboration with Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron (2005) and the award-winning Solar Strand in New York (2012).<br/>
<br/>
Following Hood&#8217;s talk, three sets of speakers will initiate conversations with each other and the audience about three key questions essential to the Institute's development.<br/>
<br/>
The participants include practitioners and thinkers whose work engages the arts, the sciences and social sciences, museums, performance, architecture, and landscape design.<br/>
<br/>
The first conversation is about &#8220;Interdisciplinarity.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;This school has a great tradition of interdisciplinary teaching and research, and so for this conversation we have invited people like emeritus humanities professor <strong>Jim Clifford</strong>, one of the founding voices of that tradition at UCSC,&#8221;&#160;said Weber.<br/>
<br/>
Clifford will be joined on the panel by UCSC astrophysicist <strong>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</strong>, a co-founder of UCSC's Open Lab, an art/science collaboration; <strong>Kim Yasuda</strong>, co-director of the University of California Institute for Research in the Arts; and <strong>Marina McDougall</strong> of San Francisco's Exploratorium. Dean Yager will serve as moderator.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
The second conversation is titled &#8220;Envelope, Contents, and Community&#8221; and will be moderated by <strong>Connie Wolf</strong> of Stanford's Cantor Arts Center, who was formerly founding director of the Contemporary Jewish Museum. It will explore how museum architecture intersects with landscape design, programming and audiences.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The institute should function as a gathering place for people&#8212;as a social and intellectual hub on campus, and as an attraction for off-campus visitors,&#8221; Weber explained.&#160;&#8220;How do you make that happen in terms of built form?&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Other participants in this conversation will include <strong>Walter Hood</strong>, architect <strong>Teddy Cruz</strong> of UC San Diego, and artist <strong>Harrell Fletcher</strong> of Portland State University.<br/>
<br/>
The third conversation, &#8220;Presenting in the Academy,&#8221; will include <strong>Kristy Edmunds</strong>, director of UCLA's Center for the Art of Performance, along with <strong>Lawrence Rinder</strong>, director of the Berkeley Art Museum.<br/>
<br/>
They will be joined by <strong>Elisabeth Cameron</strong> from UCSC&#8217;s History of Art and Visual Culture Department, who brings extensive museum experience to her current role in academia.&#160;John Weber will moderate this conversation.<br/>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>The American people are going ga-ga for Ronan the beat-keeping sea lion, who has been featured on "Weekend Edition Saturday" on National Public Radio, and as the answer to a question on the NPR news quiz show "Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me."</p>
<p>To date, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yS6qU_w3JQ">the YouTube video of the artfully head-bopping sea lion</a> has garnered more than 1 million hits.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/04/sea-lion-beat.html">original story</a>&#8212;which appeared first on UCSC's news site&#8212;conveys the scientific impact of the discovery while being endearing and funny in an off-beat way. But more importantly, the coverage&#8212;which also included an <a href="http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/01/17557249-this-sea-lion-grooves-to-a-disco-beat">NBC news story</a>, a feature in the <a href="http://situationroom.blogs.cnn.com/2013/04/03/sea-lion-dances-to-boogie-wonderland/">CNN Situation Room</a>, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-sea-lion-dance-bob-head-beat-music-20130402,0,4271815.story">a story in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>, a <a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/science/article/Sea-lion-with-rhythm-and-taste-for-disco-4404457.php"><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> feature</a>, and international press coverage&#8212;is drawing attention to the adventurous spirit and research prowess of the campus as well as its strong interdisciplinary focus, considering the beat-keeping demonstration took place at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory but was undertaken by a graduate student in psychology named Peter Cook.</p>
<p>This demonstration appears to be breaking new ground. Ronan the sea lion is the first non-human mammal that has demonstrated a very strong ability to keep the beat.&#160;</p>
<p>Here are some of the more eye-opening and amusing media moments:</p>
<p>-- When NPR's Scott Simon asked Peter Cook if Ronan had a favorite song, Cook replied: "'Boogie Wonderland' by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire is far and away her favorite. Yeah. The Backstreet Boys, she was good and she was willing to participate, but I didn't feel like she had the same spark as when we gave her the disco."</p>
<p>-- After introducing the sea lion story, CNN's Jeanne Moos wryly observed: "Now you probably think any idiot can keep a beat but sometimes it is hard even for humans. Ask Karl Rove or Rodney Dangerfield." (While Moos mentioned these two celebrities, the screen displayed footage illustrating their hapless dancing moves.)</p>
<p>-- But clearly, most media also picked up on the scientific value. Consider this observation from Alan Boyle, science editor, NBC News: "Previously, scientists had assumed that the ability to move in time with a beat was connected to the ability for vocal <span>learning</span> and vocal mimicry. That's something that humans, cockatoos, parrots, and budgies can do. But sea lions aren't mimics. When was the last time you heard a sea lion say, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3YNFpyi_ME"><span>"Polly wants a snapper"</span></a>?</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f5eed453807270466e0e60c49adb5a57"><name>new-apo-website</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New website for Academic Personnel Office</title><summary>The Academic Personnel Office (APO) launched its redesigned website on Thursday, April 11, 2013.</summary><start-date>1365663660000</start-date><display-name>New website for Academic Personnel Office</display-name><path>/2013/04/new-apo-website</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/new-apo-website</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1365630702612</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1365630702612</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The Academic Personnel Office (APO) launched its redesigned website on Thursday, April 11, 2013.

Carr's talk, "What would Ed do? Innovations in science and management of kelp forest ecosystems in the 21st century," will take place on Saturday, April 27, at 2:15 p.m. in the University Center at California State University Monterey Bay in Seaside. The event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>The Ed Ricketts Memorial Lecture was created to honor people who have exhibited exemplary work throughout their career and advanced the status of knowledge in the field of marine science. Ricketts, who wrote the influential ecological handbook <em>Between Pacific Tides,</em> operated Pacific Biological Laboratories in Monterey and was a close friend of novelist John Steinbeck, serving as inspiration for notable Steinbeck characters such as Doc in <em>Cannery Row.</em> Carr is the fifth UCSC faculty member to receive this honor since it was established in 1986.</p>
<p>Carr's research focuses on coastal marine ecosystems and the population and community ecology of coastal marine fishes. His ecological research informs management and conservation topics such as artificial reefs, management of kelp forest ecosystems, the design and evaluation of marine protected areas, collaborative fisheries research, ecosystem-based fisheries management, and large-scale, long-term monitoring studies. He is a principal investigator with the <a href="http://www.piscoweb.org/">Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)</a>, a multi-university consortium designed to conduct interdisciplinary research that informs coastal marine management and policy.</p>
<p>Carr is a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences and an Aldo Leopold Leadership Fellow. He served as co-chair of the Science Advisory Team to California's Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) and California's Ocean Protection Council (OPC), and he sits on the steering committee for CAMEO, a funding program for marine ecosystem research jointly sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the National Marine Fisheries Service. Carr received his B.A. in biology at UC Santa Cruz, his M.S. at San Francisco State University and Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, and his Ph.D. at UC Santa Barbara. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1997.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>04-28-2013</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0f5adf72807270466e0e60c460b233ad"><name>commencement-calendar</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2013 Commencements &amp; Celebrations</title><summary>Commencement exercises for UCSC's Class of 2013 will be held on Friday through Sunday, June 14-16.

I believe this new answering system will allow&#160;callers to get the information they seek more quickly while at&#160;the same time freeing emergency dispatchers to complete other&#160;tasks. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is following the lead of&#160;many police agencies in California that deploy automated&#160;attendants for non-emergency phone calls. This new system will&#160;have&#160;no impact on the dispatch center E9-1-1 system, which&#160;allows callers who dial 9-1-1 for an emergency to be directly&#160;connected to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department dispatch&#160;center. Cell&#160;phone callers can call 9-1-1 for an emergency,&#160;with major cell service providers routing calls directly to UC&#160;Santa Cruz Police Department dispatch center rather than&#160;going through CHP. Cell&#160;phone users are also reminded to keep&#160;the non-emergency number of 831-459-2231 in their phone so they&#160;can utilize this phone service in a non-emergency situation.<br/>
<br/>
The department will monitor how successful this automated&#160;attendant is, but believes the public will be pleased with this&#160;new assistance. The automated phone attendant will provide more&#160;efficient assistance to the public by providing various forms of&#160;information and options for a wide range of services; the&#160;service is available 24 hours a day. The automatic attendant&#160;will&#160;quickly get the caller to the appropriate person who can&#160;help them.</span> 
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Phone calls will be answered by the automated attendant starting&#160;the morning of Monday, April 15, at 9 a.m. Those needing to talk&#160;to a dispatcher for a non-emergency police, fire, or&#160;medical&#160;response will be able to do so through this attendant.</span> 
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>As always, we encourage anyone with an emergency threat to life,&#160;safety or property to call 9-1-1 for immediate connection to our&#160;Dispatch Center.</span></div>

<br/>
The signs, supported by a gift from Redtree Properties of Santa Cruz, document stops along a self-guided walking tour of the historic district at the base of campus. Since its founding in 2008, the Friends have raised $80,000 and put in thousands of hours documenting and restoring the area where first the Davis and Cowell and later Henry Cowell companies mined limestone and used wood-burning kilns to convert it into lime in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Lime was a key ingredient in plaster and mortar building materials in the decades after the Gold Rush.<br/>
<br/>
"If not for limestone, lime, and Henry Cowell, there wouldn&#8217;t be a University of California, Santa Cruz, noted Friends president Frank Perry in remarks at Friday's ceremony. The S.H. Cowell Foundation donated the Cowell Ranch to the University of California for a new campus.<br/>
<br/>
Restoration of the exterior of Cabin B across Coolidge Drive from the Cook House is now complete. Cowell's workers&#8211;many from Italy and the Azores, and later Portugal&#8211; lived in the 12x14 foot cabins, eating at the Cook House. The cabins had two or three beds and a small stove for heat.<br/>
<br/>
Next will come a door, window, and interior finishes. Funding has been provided by the Cabrillo Civic Clubs of California including the Santa Cruz chapter. Alameda Roofing and Western Roofing Supply donated a new shingle roof. Some of the exterior is recycled barn wood, a gift from Jean Dempsey. UCSC also supplied wood from trees felled to make room for building construction on campus.<br/>
<br/>
Six workers cabins remain, dating back to the late 1800s. Two remain standing; four have collapsed but are in the plans for restoration.<br/>
<br/>
The historic district is a "symbol of the rich and diverse fabric of the community," said Sarah Latham, UCSC vice chancellor of business services, who also spoke at Friday's event. The restoration of the historic area "symbolizes stewardship and preservation of resources," she said.<br/>
<br/>
Perry said a next step is a study on how to rehabilitate or restore the cooperage built in 1869 to construct barrels to hold the lime. It is now stabilized, supported on a steel and timber frame.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Perry said, a joint exhibit on the natural history of lime in Santa Cruz is being planned for the fall by the San Lorenzo Valley Museum in Boulder Creek and the Santa Cruz Natural History Museum.<br/>

<p>Collectively, the artists invite you to redefine the meanings of "digital arts" and "new media" by way of hybridized video installations, interactive experiences, telematic performances and sound art; individually, within those digitized formats, each artist and their work will examine the social impact and intersection of art and media.</p>
<p>As a whole, <strong>ground (ctrl)</strong> breeds fresh materiality through collaborative digital research; with soil, light and interactivity as the main motifs that bridge all the artworks in the exhibition, these elements will purposefully transform the Digital Arts Research Center into a living entity.</p>
<p>Experience and participate the latest digital technologies and experimental performances. The artists will be on hand to discuss their work and give tours. <strong>g</strong><strong>round (ctrl)</strong> is curated by Shelby Graham, Sesnon Gallery Director.</p>
<p>Artists: John-Patrick Ayson, Deryke Franz, Jacob Garbe, Catalina Giraldo, Dan Heller, Andrew Siller, Eve Warnock, Laura Wright</p>

<br/>
The annual exhibition of the Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) MFA program represents the culmination of two years of intensive study by UCSC graduate students.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The artists invite you to redefine the meanings of "digital arts" and "new media" by way of hybridized video installations, interactive experiences, telematic performances and sound art,&#8221; noted Shelby Graham, director of UCSC&#8217;s Sesnon Gallery and the curator of this year&#8217;s exhibition.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Within those digitized formats, each artist examines the social impact new media has in our lives.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Graham added that two of the artists have created unpredictable playable games highlighting UCSC&#8217;s award-winning gaming program.</p>
<p>A free public opening reception will take place on Thursday, May 2, from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. at the exhibition space, featuring the latest digital technologies and experimental performances. All of the student artists will be on hand to discuss their work and give tours.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to the reception at 6 p.m., special guest <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/gaming-lens-world"><strong>Will Wright</strong></a>, the pioneer game designer and inventor of the epic <strong>Sims</strong> franchise, will give a lecture at the Media Theater titled &#8220;Gaming As A Lens on the World.&#8221;</p>
<p>The talk is presented as part of UCSC&#8217;s <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/lectures/arts-division-lecture-series-2013">2013 Arts Division Lecture Series</a> &#8220;Engaging the Mind.&#8221; The community is invited, and admission is free.</p>
<p>Described by <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine as &#8220;one of the 100 people that changed America,&#8221; Wright is a gaming industry legend.<br/>
<br/>
He established a new genre of gaming, creating groundbreaking games such as <strong>SimCity</strong>, <strong>The Sims</strong> and <strong>Spore</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
Co-founder of the game development company Maxis, Wright has been an inspiration to many of UCSC&#8217;s DANM students, who explore gaming as a conceptual framework.<br/>
<br/>
The Digital Arts and New Media MFA Program (DANM) at UC Santa Cruz serves as a center for the development and study of digital media and the cultures they have helped create.<br/>
<br/>
Faculty and students are drawn from a variety of backgrounds such as the arts, computer engineering, the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences to pursue interdisciplinary artistic and scholarly research and production, in the context of a broad examination of digital arts and cultures.<br/>

I see students engaged in the full range of academic and creative pursuits, as well as extracurricular activities. This issue of <em>Review</em> celebrates our students.</p>
<p>Who are today's students?</p>
<p>To give you an idea, consider our most recent applicant pool. More than 46,000 prospective undergraduates&#8212;the most ever&#8212;applied for admission to UCSC for the fall 2013 quarter.</p>
<p>UCSC had the highest increase of freshman applications in the UC system and the second highest increase in transfer applications.</p>
<p>Many UCSC students are first-generation. Almost half of the applications for fall came from students whose parents haven't earned a degree from a four-year university.</p>
<p>They are multicultural. The number of African American, Chicano/Latino, and Asian American freshman applicants also increased.</p>
<p>They are smart and hardworking. The admitted freshman class for fall 2012 had an average high school GPA of nearly 3.8.</p>
<p>Our students are also whimsical, fun, creative, and innovative&#8212;think hipster glasses and flowered velvet Doc Martens&#8212;in addition to being tutors, mentors, and volunteers.</p>
<p>They are active&#8212;and we're ready for them, with more than 100 student organizations, 14 men's and women's NCAA intercollegiate teams, and a wide variety of athletic clubs, intramural leagues, and rec programs.</p>
<p>Banana Slugs revel in our broad academic offerings and thrive in our interdisciplinary environment. Undergraduates choose from 60 majors, 37 minors, and 54 concentrations.</p>
<p>It's our job to provide them with opportunities. Our growing popularity tells me we're succeeding, offering an education that appeals to bright students with idealistic goals. UCSC students are tenacious, imaginative, conscientious, unlimited. They are actively making the world they want to live in. They are preparing their wings to fly, and I never tire of watching them soar.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>George Blumenthal&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="153f30d6807270466e0e60c45ec42c4c"><name>rev-spring-13-credits</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Credits</title><start-date>1366099200000</start-date><display-name>Credits</display-name><path>/2013/04/rev-spring-13-credits</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/rev-spring-13-credits</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1366156062877</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1366655339518</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><h2>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ</h2>

Gabby Giffords, and Zimmerman's family among the attendees.<br/>
<br/>
Zimmerman, 30, died in the shooting rampage that killed five others and wounded 13 including Giffords January 8, 2011. Working as Giffords' outreach director he had organized the "Congress on the Corner" event outside a Tucson supermarket where the shooting happened. He was the first congressional staffer to be killed in the line of duty.<br/>
<br/>
After graduating from UC Santa Cruz, Zimmerman obtained a masters degree in social work at the University of Arizona. He joined Gifford's staff soon after she was elected in 2006.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking to Zimmerman's parents, Ross Zimmerman and Emily Nottingham, Biden said "Gabe was stolen from you doing the work of democracy."<br/>
<br/>
A plaque created by a Tucson artist commemorating Zimmerman's service hangs in the Gabriel Zimmerman Meeting Room, formerly known as HVC 215, a basement conference room in the Capitol Visitor Center where House Democrats&#8217; hold weekly caucus meetings along with regular gatherings of press secretaries, chiefs of staff, and other aides.<br/>
<br/>
Nottingham said she hopes that in 50 years when members of Congress walk by the plaque and learn who her son was they will enter the room "and stand up for what they believe in.<br/>
<br/>
"I hope the love Gabe had for democracy and people lingers in this room for many, many years," she said.<br/>
<br/>
Others speaking at the ceremony were Ross Zimmerman, Boehner, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Rep. Ron Barber, another Giffords aide who was wounded in shooting and later succeeded Giffords.<br/>
<br/>
A scholarship fund in Zimmerman's name has been created at UCSC for outstanding students in the Division of Social Sciences who want to pursue public service.<br/>
<br/>
Zimmerman's parents and brother visited Santa Cruz two weeks ago to scatter some of his ashes and meet the second winner of the Gabe Zimmerman scholarship.<br/>

This is a longer version of a story that appeared in the spring '13 issue of</em> Review <em>magazine.</em></p>
<p>It's hard to imagine what UC Santa Cruz might have become: a cluster of high-density buildings rising out of the Great Meadow like some unsightly crown.</p>
<p>But thanks to a combination of two visionary UC administrators, a modernist landscape architect, and an influential team of California architects, those early plans to build a university in the middle of beautiful slope of grass died a quick death. Instead, the state's seventh UC campus became a daring experiment, not only in its academic form but also in its design.</p>
<p>It was UC President Clark Kerr and UCSC's first chancellor, Dean McHenry, who championed a bold educational plan for the campus, which was to be set on 2,000 acres of ranch land overlooking the Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>Instead of a large, impersonal university, McHenry and Kerr&#8212;old college roommates &#8212; envisioned 15-20 small residential colleges with individual identities where students would mingle closely with their professors while enjoying the benefits of a major research institution.</p>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> called it "an experimental project widely regarded as one of the most exciting in education." The two men insisted the campus architecture reflect those same innovative ideals.</p>
<p>"California was full of the post-war optimism of the 1950s," said Frank Zwart (Cowell '71), UCSC's Campus Architect Emeritus. "Everything was possible and California was the wave of the future."</p>
<p>In that spirit, Kerr and McHenry wanted buildings that were original, matched the spectacular landscape, and not only fostered community but also intellectual exploration.</p>
<p>In his oral history, Kerr likened his idea for the campus design to an old fishing village, Aigues-Mortes, in southern France where one step through an ancient stone wall took a visitor from a bustling town into the forest. McHenry talked of finding "as much diversity among the colleges as you'd find in a high quality residential district of a suburban area of city."</p>
<p>&#160;They convinced Regents to hire a consortium of influential Northern California designers to prepare a master plan that would concretize their maverick vision and guide the location and design of buildings. Architects John Carl Warnecke, Ernest J. Kump, Theodore Bernardi, Robert Anshen and Steve Allen were soon wandering the old Cowell ranch land, taking notes and envisioning what a new university could be.</p>
<p>Leading their walks through the grass and redwoods was Thomas Church, a UC Berkeley- and Harvard-trained landscape architect known for his trademark hat, high-laced boots, and the way his designs blurred the border between inside and out.</p>
<p>Church and the architects were so struck by the beauty of the UCSC site they convinced the Regents to move the heart of the campus out of the meadow and into the trees, where the flora and terrain would be both a challenge and an inspiration.</p>
<p>"Instead of remaking the land, the land must remake our standard conceptions of building and place and parking lot," Church wrote enthusiastically after touring the site in 1962. He warned, however, "any attempt of a designer to compete in grandeur with this site is doomed to failure&#8230;color and texture will be as important as form."</p>
<p>Rather than being daunted, the master planners rose to the land's challenge of knolls, ravines and towering trees. "Never, perhaps, has the site chosen for the development of such a venture been so inspiring," the architects wrote in their 1963 Long Range Development Plan (LRDP).</p>
<p>They noted, it was also a time when architectural styles were being reappraised, affording a chance to be different. "There is a new desire for emotional content in the design of important buildings, and for a richness and subtlety that seems to have been lost in a concern with technological innovations," they wrote</p>
<p>The planners envisioned one type of architecture for buildings that would sit "proudly" on hilltops and another for those sheltered in the trees. Colleges would be no more than three-stories with the potential for high-rise structures as the campus grew. They talked of using light colors and off-whites used in densely forested areas with warmer earth tones on sunny hilltops. Textures would range from smooth to rugged and while the residential colleges would be informal in style, the central campus buildings would be more formal, "almost monumental." There must be no clich&#233;s, no tired architecture&#8212;whether traditional or modern, they said.</p>
<p>They wrote of a science center that would give "a sense of courts and quadrangles with provisions for future tower buildings." They envisioned undergraduate colleges within walking distance of the academic core and other colleges. "Thus there is separation but no sense of isolation," they said.</p>
<p>Most importantly, they wrote, "The campus should not have a single 'style.'"</p>
<p>Three of the LRDP architects went on to design buildings on campus. John Carl Warnecke and Associates created McHenry Library with its textures of concrete, exposed aggregate and glass reflecting the ruggedness of the forest. Kump Associates of Palo Alto designed Crown College, and Theodore Bernardi of Wuster, Bernardi and Emmons planned the campus' first college, Cowell.</p>
<p>It was not an easy road, however.</p>
<p>Bernardi, whose firm was closely associated with what was known as Bay Area Style which lay between the more severe International and elaborate Beaux Arts styles, produced a design for Cowell that was first rejected both by Kerr and the Regents.</p>
<p>&#160;"&#8230;It looked like a motel on Lake Tahoe &#8212; scattered throughout the trees," Kerr said in his oral history. The firm was sent back to design a cluster of inward-facing buildings with cast-in place concrete walls, heavy timbers and red-tile roofs nestled on the very edge of the forest. Two courtyards "one for men, the other for women," were included in the plan, according to McHenry in a 1963 Chancellor's memo.</p>
<p>Joseph Esherick's Stevenson College with its shed roofs and saddlebag-style rooms reflected his dedication to site requirements and user needs. Campus architect Zwart noted Esherick went so far as to lay out buildings on the site as design work progressed, skewing some of the building footprints in order to preserve a number of massive redwoods.</p>
<p>Budget constraints, however, forced the use of cheaper materials like stucco, wood frame and nail-on windows rather than the concrete and timber used for Cowell.</p>
<p>Both Cowell and Stevenson colleges were completed in 1966 &#8212; a year after the UCSC opening, forcing students to live in trailers, eat their meals in the East Field House and take classes in what is now Thimann Laboratories for the first year of their college life.</p>
<p>Crown and Merrill came next in 1967 and 1968-69.</p>
<p>Merrill College architects Campbell &amp; Wong set their stark buildings amid thick redwoods with playful components like bridges, balconies and blue roofs. Crown's architect, Ernest J. Kump, would follow a slightly more traditional path that barely hinted at his innovations in the world of modernism during the 1930s and 40s.</p>
<p>All four of the early colleges seemed to satisfy the ideals set out by the founding architects &#8212; although neglected from the Long Range Development Plan design was an intramural sports stadium proposed for the quarry and a giant tower rising out of the redwoods near Science Hill &#8212; a feature that may have been better left unbuilt, according to Zwart, who saw sketches of possible designs for the edifice.</p>
<p>"It had a real Jetsons quality to it," Zwart said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="193f38ec807270466e0e60c46813876b"><name>puma-study</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Puma tracking in Santa Cruz Mountains reveals impact of habitat fragmentation</title><summary>In the first published results of more than three years of tracking mountain lions in the Santa Cruz Mountains, UC Santa Cruz researchers document how human development affects the predators' habits. </summary><keywords>uc, ucsc. uc santa cruz, social sciences, pumas, puma project, mountain lions, Santa Cruz Mountains, environmental studies, chris wilmers, </keywords><start-date>1366232400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz Puma Project</display-name><path>/2013/04/puma-study</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/puma-study</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1366223173810</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1366651350763</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/puma-7f-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/puma-7f-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>puma-7f-300.jpg</name><display-name>puma-7f-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>115045</file-size><width>350</width><height>525</height></image><image-alt>Puma</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/puma-7f-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/puma-7f-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>puma-7f-80.jpg</name><display-name>puma-7f-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>28872</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Puma</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>7F, an approximately 7-year-old mother is treed by trailing hounds so researchers can replace her collar before the batteries fail. 7F lives in the mountains above Los Gatos and has had three litters of kittens in the four years since she was first collared.&#160; (Photo by Paul Houghtaling)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/puma-17m-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/puma-17m-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>puma-17m-350.jpg</name><display-name>puma-17m-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>120341</file-size><width>351</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>16M, an approximately 6-year-old adult male roamed a territory that crossed Highway 17 for about a year and a half.&#160; He has a fresh wound on his right hip and thigh after being hit by a car while crossing the highway in November 2010.

<br/>
In <a href="http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0060590">findings published today</a> (April 17) in the online journal <em>PLOS ONE,</em> UCSC associate professor of environmental studies Chris Wilmers and colleagues with the <a href="http://santacruzpumas.org/">UC Santa Cruz Puma Project</a> describe tracking 20 lions over 6,600 square miles for three years. Researchers are trying to understand how habitat fragmentation influences the physiology, behavior, ecology, and conservation of pumas in the Santa Cruz Mountains.<br/>
<br/>
"Depending on their behavior, animals respond very differently to human development," Wilmers said. Lions are "totally willing to brave rural neighborhoods, but when it comes to reproductive behavior and denning they need more seclusion."<br/>
<br/>
The large predators living relatively close to a metropolitan area require a buffer from human development at least four times larger for reproductive behaviors than for other activities such as moving and feeding.<br/>
<br/>
"In addition, pumas give a wider berth to types of human development that provide a more consistent source of human interface," such as neighborhoods, than they do in places where human presence is more intermittent, as with major roads or highways, the authors write.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>37 lions captured</strong></p>
<p>Wilmers and his team, which includes graduate students, and a dog tracking team working with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, have captured 37 lions to date. Twenty&#8211;12 females and eight males&#8211;were closely followed between 2008 and 2011. Once captured and anesthetized, the lions' sex was determined, they were weighed, measured, fit with an ear tag and a collar with a GPS transmitter. The collars, developed, in part, by an interdisciplinary team at UCSC, including wildlife biologists and engineers, transmit location data every four hours.<br/>
<br/>
Researchers are able to track the lions' movements and calculate locations of feeding sites, communication spots, and dens.&#160; Pumas communicate with scent markings known as "scrapes" where they scrape leaves or duff into a pile then urinate on it. Males typically make the scrapes, advertising their presence and availability. Females visit scrapes when looking for mates. Video belows shows lion 17M scraping.</p>

<p>The Puma Project team set up and monitored remote cameras at 44 scrape locations and documented males and females, which confirmed GPS data from the pumas' collars.</p>
<p>Researchers also found 10 den sites belonging to 10 different female lions. They visited 224 "GPS clusters" where activities suggested a feeding site, and located prey remains at 115 sites.<br/>
<br/>
Wilmers said the research is helping identify corridors where pumas typically travel between areas of high-quality habitat. This includes neighborhoods where females often are willing to explore for food for their fast-growing brood.</p>
<p><strong>Brushes with humans</strong></p>
<p>Brushes with humans have resulted in casualties when lions were struck by cars or caught raiding livestock. One male known as 16M was shown to have crossed busy Highway 17 between Scotts Valley and Los Gatos 31 times. He was hit and badly injured in November 2010 and recently shot and killed after attacking goats. A female, 18F, who may have been 16M's mate, was killed in 2011 crossing the winding highway.<br/>
<br/>
Eight of the 11 pumas that died during the study were killed when caught attacking domestic livestock. Wilmers advised owners of goats or other livestock to consider keeping them in a "fully-enclosed mountain lion-proof structure."<br/>
<br/>
While Wilmers advised people to proceed with caution in any known mountain lion roaming grounds he said humans need not panic about the presence of mountain lions.<br/>
<br/>
The study's conservation goals are meant to help lions survive in the midst of rapidly growing human development by building awareness of lions' behavior and providing safe transit opportunities under or over major highways.<br/>

<br/>
Stone, who lives in Saratoga, CA, has been producing vivid watercolors for more than five decades.<br/>
<br/>
Infused with humor and wit, Stone&#8217;s work presents the viewer with intellectual puzzles that challenge the imagination. Her intimate visual narratives capture scenes of women in whirlwind action and quiet domesticity, while her use of an eccentric bird&#8217;s eye viewpoint enhances these experiences.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Judaic influences reflect Stone&#8217;s own personal heritage. Hebrew calligraphy, prayer shawls, and Torah scrolls are blended into a number of works.<br/>
<br/>
Stone also explores universal themes about the ever-changing roles of women, as she portrays works that run the gamut from Eastern European Jewish settings to the perilous navigations of African American women, to the intricacies of Pacific Rim textile patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Stone often uses images of unconnected tightropes to remind the viewer of the difficulties women must face daily.</p>
<p>The exhibit will include works such as &#8220;A Delicate Balance&#8221; and &#8220;Don&#8217;t Look in a Mirror When Dancing on a Rope,&#8221; spotlighting women in Eastern European clothing viewed from above, as they navigate a tightrope.<br/>
<br/>
Ropes also play a role in her images of African American women, influenced by her encounters with African American culture in Chicago. Trained at Chicago&#8217;s Art Institute and the University of Illinois, Stone depicts themes of joy and suffering, love and family, rootlessness and rootedness, and the struggle to upset the status quo in her many scenes of Jewish and African American life.<br/>
<br/>
Pacific Rim cultures are also embedded in Stone&#8217;s art. In her 1985 exhibit "Oy Butterfly," she blended Japanese and Jewish imagery for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
The&#160; show is curated by Joan Blackmer, director of the Cowell Galleries, including the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery and the Ann Dizikes Annex. It will be open to the public Tuesdays through Sundays, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
A Mothers Day Gala Reception will additionally take place on May 12, from 2 to 4 pm, in the Smith Gallery. Prior to the reception, Stone will lead a Gallery Walk, beginning a 12:30 p.m.<br/>

New observations of the blazar known as PKS 1424+240 show that it is the most distant known source of very high-energy gamma rays, but its emission spectrum now appears highly unusual in light of the new data.</p>
<p>A team led by physicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, used data from the Hubble Space Telescope to set a lower limit for the blazar's redshift (z &#8805; 0.6035), which corresponds to a distance of at least 7.4 billion light-years. Over such a great distance, a substantial proportion of the gamma rays should be absorbed by the extragalactic background light, but calculations that account for the expected absorption yield an unexpected emission spectrum for the blazar.</p>
<p>"We're seeing an extraordinarily bright source which does not display the characteristic emission expected from a very high-energy blazar," said Amy Furniss, a graduate student at the <a href="http://scipp.ucsc.edu/">Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics</a> (SCIPP) at UCSC and first author of a paper describing the new findings. The paper has been accepted for publication in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> and is currently <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4859">posted on arXiv.org</a>.</p>
<p>Coauthor David Williams, adjunct professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, said the findings may indicate something new about the emission mechanisms of blazars, the extragalactic background light, or the propagation of gamma-ray photons over long distances.</p>
<p>"We're finding very high-energy gamma-ray sources at greater distances than we thought we might, and in doing so we're finding some things we don't entirely understand," Williams said. "Having a source at this distance will allow us to better understand how much background absorption there is and test the cosmological models that predict the extragalactic background light."</p>
<p>The extragalactic background light (EBL) is the diffuse radiation from all stars and galaxies, a dim but pervasive glow that fills the universe. When a high-energy gamma-ray photon collides with a lower-energy EBL photon, they annihilate and create an electron-positron pair. The farther gamma rays have to travel the more likely they are to be absorbed by this mechanism. This limits the distance to which sources of very high-energy gamma rays can be detected.</p>
<p>Measuring the EBL is extremely difficult because there are so many bright sources of light in our immediate neighborhood. In addition to estimates based on cosmological models, astronomers have used galaxy counts to set a lower limit for the EBL. Using a model close to this lower limit to calculate the expected absorption of very high-energy gamma rays from PKS 1424+240, Furniss derived an intrinsic gamma-ray emission spectrum for the blazar. The results, however, deviate from the expected emission based on current blazar models.</p>
<p>Blazar emission is thought to result from a relativistic jet of particles powered by matter falling onto a supermassive black hole at the center of the host galaxy. "There may be something going on in the emission mechanisms of the blazar that we don't understand," Williams said. "There are more exotic explanations as well, but it may be premature to speculate at this point."</p>
<p>Gamma rays from PKS 1424+240 were first detected by the <a href="http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</a> and subsequently by the ground-based instrument <a href="http://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/">VERITAS</a> (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System), which is sensitive to gamma-rays in the very high-energy (VHE) band from about 100 GeV to more than 10 TeV. To determine the redshift of the blazar--a measure of how much the light from an object has been stretched to longer wavelengths by the expansion of the universe--the researchers used data obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph for another research program.</p>

<br/>
Numbers published today (April 18) by the University of California&#8217;s Office of the President show UCSC offered admission to 18,703 applicants for an admit rate of 48.6 percent compared with 60.5 percent a year ago. The academic profile of freshmen offered admission reflects UCSC&#8217;s increasing selectivity, with a mean grade point average of 3.86 and increases in all ACT and SAT test scores.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Our more selective 'admit' rate is a reflection of two things: a record number of applications and a smaller number of openings,&#8221; said UCSC Director of Admissions Michael McCawley. &#8220;We have admitted a very talented group of students from a very talented group of applicants.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
McCawley attributes UCSC's increased popularity to many factors. "Prospective students and their families recognize the distinctive educational experience at UC Santa Cruz &#8211; our academic strengths, access to faculty, high research impact, the residential colleges, and the natural beauty of our campus overlooking the Monterey Bay and close to Silicon Valley," he said.<br/>

UCSC officials are aiming for a fall 2013 freshman class of 3,500 students &#8211; approximately 300 fewer than fall 2012 &#8211; with about 94 percent of incoming freshmen being California residents, McCawley said.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Last year we had more students accept their offers of admission and enroll than we anticipated, so we need to reduce the size of this year&#8217;s incoming class,&#8221; McCawley said. &#8220;I wish we could accommodate more students, but we must ensure that those we do enroll have a high-quality experience at our campus.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
UCSC received significantly more applications from out-of-state residents than a year ago. Applications from international students were up 68 percent. Offers of admission to "non-residents" increased for both out-of-state students and international students, accounting for 16.4 percent of all admission offers. The campus expects to enroll approximately 200 new non-resident freshmen in the fall.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Increasing the number of non-resident undergraduates is an important goal for UCSC,&#8221; said Chancellor George Blumenthal. &#8220;Not only do they add to the geographic diversity of our campus, but the additional tuition will help offset some of the budget cuts we've endured. We continue to primarily serve our California students, and our enrollment goals reflect that commitment,&#8221; Blumenthal added.<br/>
<br/>
Percentages of students considered &#8220;first-generation&#8221; and those coming from low-income families decreased slightly to levels comparable to fall 2011. Thirty-nine percent of admitted freshmen are from families where neither parent has a four-year college degree.<br/>
<br/>
The fall 2013 admitted class of California residents continues to be diverse, reflecting the demographics of the state, with 33.4 percent white/other, 31.6 percent Asian American, 27 percent Hispanic/Latino, 3.6 percent African American, 0.6 percent American Indian, and 0.3 percent Pacific Islander. An additional 3.5 percent of admitted students did not report their race/ethnicity.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;In a year where we denied more than half of our applicants, I&#8217;m glad to see that ethnic and socioeconomic diversity is holding steady,&#8221; McCawley said.<br/>
<br/>
UCSC offered an opportunity to be on a waiting list to 2,573 freshmen &#8211; all UC qualified &#8211; who were denied admission. Admitted freshmen have until May 1 to accept their admission offer.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/01/undergrad-apps-2013.html</url><title>Record applications received for fall 2013 class</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1e3e1adf807270466e0e60c405bfeeb1"><name>relentless-evolution</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book explores relentless evolution in a constantly changing world</title><summary>In his new book, biologist John Thompson argues that species must evolve constantly or they will not persist.</summary><keywords>John N.

Scientists have found, however, that species evolve relentlessly and that evolutionary changes occur at a surprisingly rapid pace.</p>
<p>How to reconcile these observations is the focus of a new book by John N. Thompson, distinguished professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In <em><a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo15112984.html">Relentless Evolution</a></em> (University of Chicago Press), Thompson argues that species must be able to evolve constantly or they will not persist.</p>
<p>"Evolution is more relentless and often more rapid than we thought as recently as a decade ago," Thompson said.</p>
<p>Populations within species evolve in different ways, adapting to local physical conditions and to a continually changing web of interacting species. Generation after generation, natural selection constantly adjusts the traits of populations. For the most part, however, this relentless evolution is not what most people envision when they think of evolution--it does not lead to the emergence of new species or "directional" change in the traits of a species.</p>
<p>"Much of adaptive evolution does not lead anywhere, yet these small changes are crucially important," Thompson writes. "These continual microevolutionary changes keep populations in the evolutionary game as they interact with other species that are themselves constantly evolving. These seemingly aimless meanderings are the essential dynamics of evolution, with directional change and speciation as occasional outcomes."</p>
<p>Pathogens and pests that affect people and crops offer some of the most familiar and compelling examples of relentless evolution. Bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics, insects evolve resistance to pesticides, and plant pathogens evolve to overcome disease-resistant varieties of crops.</p>
<p>In natural systems, biologists have documented hundreds of cases of ongoing evolution in a wide range of species. These examples include changes in morphological and physiological traits, life histories, behaviors, and interactions with other species. Microbial populations can evolve new traits in a matter of weeks, while plants and animals can evolve in detectable ways within a few decades or even a few years.</p>
<p><em>Relentless Evolution</em> examines the pace and dynamics of evolutionary change and the ecological drivers of ongoing adaptive change in species and populations. It is Thompson's fourth book on evolution, continuing his exploration of the processes that drive evolution and shape the entangled web of life.&#160; &#160;</p>
<p><em>"Relentless Evolution</em> is a masterful synthesis of scientific fields that are expanding at astonishing speed," said Carl Zimmer, an award-winning science writer and book author. "Surveying research as varied as lab experiments on bacteria to millions of years of coevolution between insects and flowers, John N. Thompson provides readers with a twenty-first century view of evolutionary change, unfolding all around us and shaping our world."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1e4ac1ec807270466e0e60c47dea3715"><name>rev-spring-13-tiucsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>This is UCSC</title><summary>News and people of note</summary><start-date>1366272000000</start-date><display-name>This is UCSC</display-name><path>/2013/04/rev-spring-13-tiucsc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/rev-spring-13-tiucsc</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1366307815835</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1366833491274</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/faber-and-obama.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/faber-and-obama.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>faber-and-obama.jpg</name><display-name>faber and obama.jpg</display-name><file-size>49927</file-size><width>300</width><height>326</height></image><image-alt>President Obama congratulates Sandra Faber </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/faber-and-obama-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/faber-and-obama-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>faber-and-obama-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>faber and obama thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21744</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>President Obama congratulates Sandra Faber </image-thumb-alt><image-caption>President Obama congratulates Sandra Faber after awarding her the National Medal of Science.

When Alec Webster started paying attention to the old Cowell Ranch Hay Barn, a century and a half of use, disuse and the elements had taken a steep toll. By the time he started really caring, it was clearly falling down. 

<p>Still, he saw an amazing opportunity. If restored, the barn could be a way to honor the history of UC Santa Cruz and the land itself, bring new focus to South Campus, add momentum to adjacent environmental and food sustainability programs, and become a catalyst for others to invest in the university. &#160;</p>
<p>Webster and his wife Claudia knew they could make the difference, do something that could stand for the next 50 years&#8212;and with care, perhaps another 150 years. As trustees of the Helen and Will Webster Foundation, they announced a gift in March of $5 million. It will be used to restore the Hay Barn as the centerpiece of a revived campus entrance and home for UCSC's innovative sustainability programs, and to fund programs centered there.</p>
<p>They had grown to love the barn and its heritage. Its hand-hewn beams, mortise and tenon joinery, determination to stay standing&#8212;all spoke of timeless principles.</p>
<p>For a long time, the barn was just <em>there,</em> waiting it seems, for Alec Webster to notice. In the 14 years that he worked on campus, Webster used the West Entrance to get to Science Hill, not the Main Entrance that would have taken him by the Hay Barn each day. As a designer and machinist for precision instrumentation developed in the Santa Cruz Institute of Particle Physics, his work contributed to groundbreaking science here and far, including Switzerland, where it helped CERN hunt for the Higgs boson.</p>
<p>When Webster decided in his late 40s to finish what he had started many years earlier at UC Santa Barbara&#8212;a degree&#8212;he enrolled at UCSC as a re-entry undergraduate. A year after he ended his affiliation as an employee of the university, he became an alum (College Eight, 2002, Environmental Studies). His time in Santa Barbara was fruitful too: It was in geology class there in 1972 that he met Claudia, who would become an art teacher as well as his partner in life and in saving an old barn.</p>
<p>As an Environmental Studies major, the barn not far from the campus farm began to show up more often in Webster's line of sight. He studied agroecology and soil conservation and was inspired by the work being done to research sustainability practices and train farmers in them.</p>
<p>The Websters' philanthropy at UCSC began in 2008 with a $30 gift to Friends of the Farm and Garden. It grew to include a variety of programs, from scholarships to the Grateful Dead Archive, but most significantly those associated with food sustainability and the 32-acre Cowell Lime Works Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, when the university was founded, the barn was already 100 years worn and facing an uncertain future. The property in a great meadow overlooking Monterey Bay had been in service as a cattle ranch, as a quarry, and as a lime works. Several of the old buildings were restored and put to use as part of the new university&#8212;including the old cookhouse, which became an Admissions Office, and the Cowell Family house, which first served as a provost residence and later for other uses. The Hay Barn was among those ignored.</p>
<p>"If you don't preserve it, everyone forgets," Webster says. "If these buildings disappear the connection to the land and its history will be lost."</p>
<p>Webster began to think of all that needed to be done in terms of a long-ago conversation with his dad as they watched a huge oil tanker from shore and imagined how difficult it would be to turn it around. "It takes forever to turn an oil tanker," Webster says. "But if you never start turning, it will never turn. Somebody has to start." That is how he views the barn project. It is the foundation that carries his parents' names that is making this turnaround possible.</p>
<p>He hopes many others will step forward, whether it is to tackle other restoration projects in the historic district, or in one of the many other areas where private support is also needed to turn things.</p>
<p>"It's a good time to get out there and do something different," Webster says. "If you wait five years for things to change or get better, you will have accomplished nothing but waiting."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he and Claudia and the scores of others on campus and in the community who have come together to bring this project to the fore, are looking forward to seeing the Hay Barn standing tall in 2015. That is when the university will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its founding on a spectacular piece of land with a rich history. Where it is still possible to do something truly different, like save a 150-year-old barn.</p>

Robotic equipment at the UCSC Chemical Screening Center was used to screen natural product extracts for novel antibiotics.&#160; 

<p>Researchers at UCSC have developed a new strategy for finding novel antibiotic compounds, using a diagnostic panel of bacterial strains for screening chemical extracts from natural sources.</p>
<p>Public health officials warn of a looming antibiotic crisis due to the steady increase in antibiotic resistance and a dramatic decline in the development of new antibiotics.</p>
<p>Most currently available antibiotics are derived from natural compounds produced by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. New antibiotics developed by drug companies are often synthetically tailored variations of existing classes of antibiotics. To combat the problem of antibiotic resistance, however, researchers desperately want to find antibiotics with completely novel structures and modes of action.</p>
<p>The new screening procedure, called BioMAP (antibiotic mode of action profile), promises to streamline the discovery of new antibiotics from natural sources by providing a low-cost, high-throughput platform for identifying compounds with novel antibiotic properties.</p>

The leaves and other parts of poison oak contain urushiol (structure shown in upper left), which causes allergic dermatitis in most people. 

<p>The last time Rebecca Braslau got a bad case of poison oak, she found herself pondering the chemical structure of urushiol, the toxic oil in poison oak and its relatives, poison ivy and poison sumac (all species of Toxicodendron).</p>
<p>"I thought, I'm a chemist. I should be able to do something about this," said Braslau, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC.</p>
<p>Now her lab has developed a spray that can be used to detect urushiol on clothes and equipment, and potentially on skin, allowing people to wash off the oil before it causes an itchy, blistering skin rash.</p>

Don Rothman, a leading voice for writers and writing during a distinguished 39-year career at UC Santa Cruz, died in his sleep in November at his Santa Cruz home. He was 67. 

<p>Rothman was also well known as a champion of UCSC's seventh college, Oakes, which he joined as a lecturer in 1973 when he was 28.</p>
<p>While Rothman is recognized for his lasting imprint on Oakes College, he is also well known for developing writing courses that helped students from all backgrounds and majors find their voice on campus and engage with the wider world.</p>

from mock trial to tango—gaining social outlets while learning valuable life lessons as part of a vibrant campus community  </article-subhead><article-text><p>Banana Slugs aren't the type to be satisfied with the status quo.</p>
<p>For example, when they felt there wasn't enough being done on an environmental level, both on and off campus, they started a fund to finance students' good ideas. When there wasn't a dodgeball team, they created one. When they wanted to tango or do stand-up comedy, they formed those groups, too.</p>
<p>Students have begun theater companies, started glossy magazines, formed dance troupes and a cappella singing groups, and initiated athletic teams and academic societies.</p>
<p>"UC Santa Cruz students are more than just creative&#8212;they have a lot of drive and self-direction, whether they are showing off their artistic talents, reaching out to communities off campus, or offering entertainment, inspiration, or support to their fellow Slugs," said Campus Provost Alison Galloway. "It's gratifying to see student-initiated, student-organized, and student-led groups being such a big part of the community here."</p>
<p>These groups provide not only entertainment and social outlets, said Galloway, but real life lessons. "For example, you'd better hone your debating chops if you ever go up against the campus's mock trial team," she said, "and you will tread more lightly on the Earth if you've been involved with the Student Environmental Center, which promotes student involvement in sustainability through research and education."</p>
<p>Student-organized groups also teach students how to lead, how to coordinate, and how to live.</p>
<p>Chris Silva, 21 (Stevenson '13, human biology), is currently the director of the UCSC Student Volunteer Center. He's a hard-working student, but he's already a leader, overseeing a staff of two&#8212;an operations director and a programs director&#8212; along with several interns.</p>
<p>"Volunteering provides opportunities to apply skills you use in classrooms while giving you real-world experience dealing with people and real-life situations you just don't get in classrooms," said Silva.</p>
<p>Aside from being good for the soul, volunteering can help students demonstrate and build empathy. Silva hopes to be a physician, in part because of a medical emergency in his family. "Part of being a physician is the knowledge and skill sets for a clinical setting, but you also need the sympathy and empathy to provide adequate care for someone in rehabilitation."</p>
<p>The Volunteer Center works with a number of nonprofits and public services in the Santa Cruz area, including the Walnut Avenue Women's Center and the Jesus, Mary and Joseph Home.</p>
<p>Another member of the UCSC community, Sayo Fujioka, is unusually qualified to talk about student leadership at UCSC. She started off as a UCSC student, then went on to be a staff advisor to campus organizations, and is currently director of Student Organization Advising and Resources. "UCSC attracts students with drive and initiative to make the world better," she said.</p>
<p>And the campus gives them valuable opportunities.</p>
<p>"UCSC provides students with realtime leadership experiences," Fujioka said. For instance, SOAR, along with Student Media/Cultural Arts and Diversity, gives students a chance to oversee university programs and activities in partnership with staff, faculty, and alumni mentors.</p>
<p>"These university mentors provide trainings, retreats, advising, and support, but students are the ones who have the responsibility for the decisions and outcomes of their programs," Fujioka said.</p>
<p>It's not surprising that many UCSC movers and shakers go on to big things post-graduation. The current and past presidents of the United States Student Association in Washington, D.C., are both graduates of UCSC and were leaders in the Student Union Assembly.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>An unsettling tremble runs through the Santa Cruz Wharf as a large truck passes, but UC Santa Cruz students Shyyon Kishani, 20, and Kevin Dang, 21, don't even flinch.</p>
<p>That's because Kishani, a junior physical science student from College Eight, and Dang, a senior economics and environmental studies major from College Nine, have spent a lot of time on the wharf. In fact, they've been tasked with figuring out alternate ways to get rid of waste and used cooking grease from the wharf without using heavy vehicles like the one rumbling past, which can cause damage to the 99-year-old structure.</p>
<p>Their efforts for the city&#8212;part of an environmental studies internship&#8212;is just one example of the way UCSC students are reaching out to work in the community that surrounds them.</p>
<p>Over the past four quarters, for example, nearly 700 UCSC environmental studies interns have contributed close to 60,000 hours of work to nonprofits, businesses, and government in the Santa Cruz area. That number doesn't include the numerous students who have given hours and made donations to nonprofits like Habitat for Humanity and Second Harvest Food Bank through the campus's Student Volunteer Center or participated in other internship programs offered through different divisions.</p>
<p>"UCSC is a real powerhouse in terms of cognitive resources," says Santa Cruz Wharf Manager Jon Bombaci (College Eight '94, environmental studies) as he stands near a display for an innovative eco-tour led by another UCSC student. "It makes great sense to me to bring that to bear on the community."</p>
<p>Chris Krohn, UCSC's environmental studies internship coordinator, is driving his battered, green van to visit sites where students are doing solar-energy audits for a company called <a href="http://www.allterrasolar.com/">Allterra</a> and getting ready to build bike generators and install solar tubes at the Natural Bridges Green Careers Center alternative school.</p>
<p>Hands on the wheel, he reflects on the beneficial relationship between students and the community. Not only do local agencies and businesses get the enthusiasm and brain power of UCSC students, he says, but the program's young men and women get an edge when it comes to landing a job.</p>
<p>"Their resume becomes filled, not with coffee shop and waitress jobs," says Krohn (Merrill '87, community studies), "but with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, California Certified Organic Farmers, California State Parks, Monterey Bay Aquarium, and California Coastal Commission positions."</p>
<p>Nowhere is that more evident than in a narrow lab at the NOAA Fisheries Ecology Division, where four UCSC students hunch over microscopes under the watchful eye of Cynthia Kern, a research biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service.</p>
<p>The students are plucking caddisflies, mayflies, and other insects out of hundreds of water samples taken after the devastating 2009 Lockheed Martin fire in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Part of a study looking at the effects of fire on salmon populations, their work is invaluable as far as getting research done in a timely fashion, Kern says.</p>
<p>For Sebastian Krause (College Eight '14, marine biology), the work is another step along his career path.</p>
<p>"I've always wanted to be a discoverer," he says, "and this is an extension of that."</p>
<p>From replanting an old Brussels sprouts field with native species at UCSC's Younger Lagoon Reserve, to comparing the price of supermarket produce with farmers' market veggies, UCSC students are making a difference not only in their own lives but also in the lives of others.</p>
<p>Marissa Kotila, co-owner of Casalegno Family Farm near Soquel, remembers one of the four interns who worked with them.</p>
<p>Deciding to grow their own heirloom tomato seedlings and being unable to finish a new greenhouse in time, the family put the fragile sprouts in the attic of their house. Each day, their UCSC intern would climb into the rafters and painstakingly hand-water every plant.</p>
<p>Says Kotila, "We harvested a beautiful crop of tomatoes that year."</p>

Try to picture an autonomous, mechanized lifeguard that waits in the water, kicking into high gear when someone starts drowning.</p>
<p>These may sound like props in the latest J. J. Abrams movie, but engineering students at UC Santa Cruz have turned their collaborations with industry professionals into essential projects that address real-world concerns ranging from climate change and public safety to the secrets of extraterrestrial soil.</p>
<p>High-profile Silicon Valley companies are sponsoring 11 senior projects this year in the hopes of providing students with immersive "real world" industry experience while giving self-motivated Banana Slugs a toehold in the highly competitive tech world.</p>
<p>Industry leaders including Google, Netflix, Xilinx, and Oracle meet with students each week to check on their progress and offer tools to help them succeed.</p>
<p>For engineering seniors, the design project is a transition from being a Banana Slug to a contributing member of a team in a career in industry or research.</p>
<p>Carol Owens (Crown College) is team leader on a project sponsored by Google to build a mobile environmental sensing system that plots field-recorded data on Google Maps.</p>
<p>It's her first time working in a group, and she's learning about the challenges of reaching a consensus. She says she was drawn to the project because of its potential to help in the real world.</p>
<p>"It has a positive impact on the environment by helping environmental scientists gather data and raising public awareness about pollutants and greenhouse gases," said Owens.</p>
<p>Finding the right project for students involves a little "matchmaking," said Patrick Mantey, who directs UCSC's Center for Information Technology and Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and is associate dean of industry programs and Baskin Professor of Computer Engineering. Some students decide to delve into venture capitalism and pursue challenges that are not funded by corporate sponsors.</p>
<p>A team of six seniors fronted $3,000 of their own money to enter the NASA Centennial Challenge, which helps NASA advance its use of technology through the use of prize competitions.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Budd (College Ten) and his colleagues are competing with 13 other teams from around the world to build a robot that can locate and retrieve extraterrestrial samples.</p>
<p>"If we are successful, not only will we have learned a great deal about autonomous robot navigation and construction, but we will also have brought a significant amount of attention to UCSC's new robotics engineering major," Budd said.</p>
<p>Budd and the rest of the team were notified in March that the cost of materials for the project will be funded by the UC Santa Cruz Foundation.</p>
<p>Students who are building a robotic lifeguard are also willing to fund their own project.</p>
<p>The lifeguard robot the team is building will be able to travel faster than a human lifeguard's average swim speed.</p>
<p>"Coming from a beach town, we realized the need for safety," said team leader Darrel Deo (Crown College). "Our lifeguard will not suffer from fatigue."</p>
<p>Ethan Papp (Crown College, '12) led a team last year that built a prototype for a glass microphone. He's back this year as a teaching assistant for the corporate senior design courses. He said he learned about professionalism and high expectations during last year's project.</p>
<p>"We were expected to produce nothing short of excellent quality work because it would be showcased and shared with a representative from Corning Incorporated, which was sponsoring our project," he said.</p>
<p>Last year's corporate sponsors hired many of last year's crew of engineering students. The high-profile companies know that UCSC engineering students are learning about the values of hard work and collaboration, said Mantey.</p>
<p>"The partnerships with industry, and the participation of the industry engineers in guiding their projects, give our students the opportunity to understand how to work in the real world," said Mantey.</p>

<p>It's 7:30 on a Saturday morning and I am having a stare-down with a sink full of dead fish.</p>
<p>Two years ago this would have seemed strange to me because, 1) I'm awake at 7:30 on a Saturday morning, an event unimaginable for most college students, and 2) I'm next to a sink full of dead fish.</p>
<p>This, however, is not part of a strange dream, but rather a first step in "bucketing," one of the many morning tasks volunteers perform at the Marine Mammal Physiology Project (MMPP), a UC Santa Cruz lab under the direction of marine biologist Terrie Williams.</p>
<p>The MMPP studies the physiological, energetic, and biomechanical parameters of several marine mammal species, and the sink full of fish will be breakfast for the lab's animal residents. MMPP is home to Primo and Puka, two Atlantic bottlenose dolphins; Taylor, a Southern sea otter; and KE-18, a Hawaiian monk seal. Three cockatoos, Junior, Mary, and Wiki, and two cockatiels, Shadow and Savannah, live here, too.</p>
<p>MMPP has also been my home, at least 20 hours a week, for the past two years, but I am a small part of the MMPP workforce. You know the saying, "It takes a village to raise a child." Then what does it take to raise nine exotic animals? The MMPP community!</p>
<p>After finishing bucketing we move on to other daily "chores" like checking the temperature and water quality of the pools, scraping algae (and feces) off of pool walls, and cleaning everything, from bird food bowls to buckets filled with fish juice.</p>
<p>It is dirty and tiring work, but I would choose all of it over cleaning my room any day. These tasks are essential for the health of the animals, the primary concern for everyone at the lab, and are actually fun when you do them with friends.</p>
<p>Throughout the day we also work to keep the animals enriched, or mentally healthy, by picking out toys, introducing them to novel things, and being creative in our interactions with them.</p>
<p>Then comes everyone's, especially the animals', favorite part&#8212;feeding! Feeding sessions use the animals' daily food as a motivator to enforce good "table manners" or behavior, and train many husbandry behaviors, including weighing, blood sampling, and exercise, and research behaviors, including diving and sitting under a metabolic dome for oxygen consumption measurements.</p>
<p>The animals voluntarily perform all research and husbandry behaviors. MMPP trainers also use these sessions to teach volunteers about feeding, training, and research techniques. As an assistant trainer, I now get to feed and train these amazing animals!</p>
<p>I am constantly learning ways to improve my communication and training abilities in different situations and with different species, skills that are necessary for a career in animal care and training. I have also been able to watch and participate in research sessions and have had the opportunity to apply the training and research knowledge I have gained while working with MMPP to my own study on the metabolic rates and assimilation efficiency of cockatoos.</p>
<p>This applied research experience will help me with my goal of going to graduate school to continue biological and conservation research.</p>
<p>MMPP has taught me the importance of teamwork, both with animals and other people. It is inspiring to see what we all can accomplish together!</p>
<p>I would like to thank Professor Terrie Williams for this opportunity to learn and live my dreams. I would also like to thank Traci Kendall, Beau Richter, and Courtney Ribiero-French for their guidance, care, and patience. Lastly, I would like to thank the rest of my MMPP family: Hilary Mills, Donna Beckett, Bryan Tom, Breanna Beck, Nick Alcaraz, Caitlin Carrington, Meagan Davis, Margaret Cummings, Noel Fong, Vicky Karabanova, Hannah Blaisdell, Laura Francisco, Kim Kendig, Travis Trihn, Aubrey Sanders, Melissa Sigala, Krista Rigsbee, Janelle Lundin, Victoria Hess, Danna Jackson-Molidor, Leann Castle, and Amber Diluzio for all of their love and support for the animals and each other.&#160;</p>
<h2>Deeper pools, deeper research</h2>
The outdoor marine mammal research facilities at Long Marine Lab need to be rebuilt and improved&#8212;the pools and life support system are nearly 35 years old. Plans are being developed and private funding sought for the project, which will allow important new study of seals, sea lions, dolphins, and sea otters. Among improvements: making the pools deeper so marine animals have room to dive&#8212;and researchers can study how they do it.

<p>Mitchell has taught in the Mathematics Department at UC Santa Cruz since 1988. He received the Ron Ruby Award for Teaching Excellence from the Division of Physical &amp; Biological Sciences in 2010.</p>
<p>Mitchell is widely praised by his students, who have described him as "brilliant and beloved" (<a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/news_events/30grads/article.asp?pid=2962">Nina McCurdy</a>) and "the most, creative, talented, and personable professor I've had" (<a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/news_events/20grads/2010/article.asp?pid=3842">Alexander Faulk</a>). A typical review on RateMyProfessors.com reads: "Richard Mitchell is the stuff. This guy is vibrant, funny, and (above all) enthusiastic about math. While it is not at all an easy class, it is enjoyable, and I strongly suggest trying to get him for Vector Calculus."</p>
<p>The Phi Beta Kappa Excellence in Teaching Award honors those who have been outstanding teachers and mentors in the opinion of members of the PBK Northern California Association. The annual awards recognize up to five outstanding teachers who are faculty members at one of the eight Northern California universities and colleges that have Phi Beta Kappa chapters. Each awardee receives a certificate, invitation to the Awards Dinner on Sunday, May 5, at the UC Berkeley Faculty Club, and a $500 honorarium.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="231344cb807270466e0e60c4a71b6de3"><name>rev-spring-13-uncommon-wheat-wang</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Uncommon People / Rachel Wheat and Yiwei Wang: Crowdsourcing for research  </title><summary>Grad students turn to a crowdfunding website to fund their bald eagle research. </summary><start-date>1366358400000</start-date><display-name>Uncommon People / Rachel Wheat and Yiwei Wang: Crowdsourcing for research  </display-name><path>/2013/04/rev-spring-13-uncommon-wheat-wang</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/rev-spring-13-uncommon-wheat-wang</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1366388065418</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1370886177478</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/rachel wheat yiwei wang.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/rachel wheat yiwei wang.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rachel wheat yiwei wang.jpg</name><display-name>rachel wheat yiwei wang.jpg</display-name><file-size>48203</file-size><width>300</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt>Rachel Wheat, left, and Yiwei Wang</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/rachel wheat yiwei wang thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/rachel wheat yiwei wang thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rachel wheat yiwei wang thumb.jpg</name><display-name>rachel wheat yiwei wang thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21988</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Rachel Wheat, left, and Yiwei Wang</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Rachel Wheat, left, and Yiwei Wang</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>(Graduate Division, environmental studies)</article-subhead><article-text><p>The male bald eagle, 3C, left the Chilkat River in Alaska and flew 500 miles south to Kitimat, B.C., where he haunted a rugged landscape of rocky shorelines and old-growth forests.</p>
<p>What was revolutionary about 3C's trip was not the distance or the destination, but rather the way UC Santa Cruz environmental studies grad students Rachel Wheat, 27, and Yiwei Wang, 30, were able to fund their tracking of him as part of their research on the influence of salmon on the ecosystem around the Chilkat in advance of a proposed sulfide mine there.</p>
<p>Instead of applying for a more-traditional grant from the National Science Foundation, which funds less than 20 percent of the requests it receives, Wheat and Wang turned to the crowdfunding website kickstarter.com. There, over a six-week period, they persuaded 100 people to contribute a total of $10,124 to subsidize four months of what they hope will become a larger study.</p>
<p>The two, who published a February article on crowdfunding in <em>Trends in Ecology and Evolution,</em> say the outreach needed to convince people to fund a wildlife study not only connects the public to research but also makes science more transparent.</p>
<p>About 30 unique visitors log onto the pair's <a href="http://www.ecologyalaska.com">website</a> daily to get front-row seats on scientific discovery, including the flight paths of four eagles equipped with GPS tracking devices and photos from 30 cameras, which capture images of grizzlies, mink, and marten that feed on the salmon.</p>
<p>With crucial help from UCSC Assistant Professor of Environmental Sciences Chris Wilmers, the two women hope their very public study will foster more interest in the ecosystem they are studying.</p>

<p>But that's exactly where Ledesma landed last year as part of his applied physics studies at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old Salinas resident, the son of agriculture laborers, arrived in Santa Cruz from Hartnell Junior College with a $25,000 S-STEM scholarship from the National Science Foundation, and a love for physics and medicine. His professors at UCSC directed him toward medical physics, where he could combine both of his passions by working in radiation oncology. He plans to pursue a Ph.D. in that field.</p>
<p>Driven to succeed, Ledesma not only won the MD Anderson research internship, but also did apprenticeships at the remote sensing lab at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, at the Project Morpheus landing simulator lab at NASA Johnson Space Center in Texas, and did calibration testing at UCSC's Center for Adaptive Optics as part of his studies.</p>
<p>"I think one of the most important qualities of Juan's personality is his persistence and faith in his own ability to succeed," says Dr. Adriane Steinacker, a UCSC physics lecturer and one of Ledesma's advisors.</p>
<p>One day, Ledesma says, he wants to be part of the group that stands up to announce: "Today we have beaten cancer. Today cancer is history."</p>
<p>But, just as importantly, he says, he wants to inspire his siblings and a large circle of cousins not only to graduate from high school but also go to college.</p>
<p>"I want to start a tradition so that, three generations from now, none of my family will be working in the fields," Ledesma says.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="237bee08807270466e0e60c4c2e3c2b1"><name>rev-spring-13-alumni-news</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni News</title><summary>Alumni news</summary><start-date>1366358400000</start-date><display-name>Alumni News</display-name><path>/2013/04/rev-spring-13-alumni-news</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/rev-spring-13-alumni-news</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1366394924490</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1366395090536</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/kathryn sullivan.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/kathryn sullivan.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kathryn sullivan.jpg</name><display-name>kathryn sullivan.jpg</display-name><file-size>6901</file-size><width>136</width><height>168</height></image><image-alt>Kathryn Sullivan (photo courtesy of NOAA)</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/joost hiltermann thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/joost hiltermann thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>joost hiltermann thumb.jpg</name><display-name>joost hiltermann thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21060</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Joost Hiltermann</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Kathryn Sullivan (photo courtesy of NOAA)&#160;</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/joost hiltermann.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/joost hiltermann.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>joost hiltermann.jpg</name><display-name>joost hiltermann.jpg</display-name><file-size>6867</file-size><width>140</width><height>170</height></image><image-alt>Joost Hiltermann</image-alt><image-caption><p>Joost Hiltermann</p></image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/elizabeth butler.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/elizabeth butler.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>elizabeth butler.jpg</name><display-name>elizabeth butler.jpg</display-name><file-size>8284</file-size><width>157</width><height>206</height></image><image-alt>Elizabeth Butler (photo courtesy of the Santa Cruz Sentinel)</image-alt><image-caption><p>Elizabeth Butler (photo courtesy of the <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em>)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/lincoln.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/lincoln.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lincoln.jpg</name><display-name>lincoln.jpg</display-name><file-size>41456</file-size><width>300</width><height>299</height></image><image-alt>Lincoln screenshot</image-alt><image-caption><p>Banana Slugs have made waves in Hollywood recently, including with alumnus Rick Carter&#8217;s Oscar win for production design on the acclaimed historical drama <em>Lincoln</em>.</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><h2>Banana Slugs in high places</h2>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has appointed alumna Kathryn Sullivan (Earth sciences '73) to serve as acting administrator for NOAA. She replaces Jane Lubchenco, who announced last year her intention to step down at the end of February as NOAA administrator and under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere.</p>
<p>Since 2011, Sullivan has served as assistant secretary of commerce for environmental observation and prediction and as deputy administrator for NOAA. She will continue to serve in these roles in addition to her new position as acting administrator. NOAA is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce and is responsible for monitoring the nation's climate, weather, oceans, fisheries, and coasts.</p>
<p>Joost Hiltermann, who received his Ph.D. in sociology from UC Santa Cruz in 1988, has been named chief operating officer of the International Crisis Group based in Brussels.</p>
<p>As the number two executive for the independent, nonprofit, non-governmental organization, Hiltermann is responsible for the oversight and management of its programs and operations around the world. He also leads the organization's strategic planning process.</p>
<h2>In memoriam: Detective Elizabeth Butler</h2>
<p>Detective Elizabeth Butler (Kresge '96, community studies), a member of the Santa Cruz police force, was killed in the line of duty on February 26. She was 38.</p>
<p>Butler and fellow Santa Cruz police detective Sgt. Loran "Butch" Baker were shot when they went to question a suspect in an alleged sexual assault.</p>
<p>They were the first Santa Cruz police officers killed in the line of duty. Thousands mourned the two fallen officers at a memorial in San Jose on March 7.</p>

<h2>Success in Tinseltown</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz alumnus Rick Carter won an Oscar this year for production design on Steven Speilberg's acclaimed film, <em>Lincoln</em>.</p>
<p>This marks the second academy award for the former UCSC art major (Kresge '74).</p>
<p>Carter previously won an Oscar for his art direction on James Cameron's Avatar. As a production designer, Carter helps create movie atmospheres and "worlds" that fulfill the director's artistic vision and serve the story, whether he's bringing dinosaurs to life in <em>Jurassic Park</em> or evoking the 19th century environment of <em>Lincoln</em>.</p>
<p>Another UCSC alum was also backstage at this year's Oscars ceremony.</p>
<p>Dency Nelson (Porter '74, theatre arts) has been a stage manager for the past 25 years, working behind the scenes at the Academy Awards, the Grammys, Screen Actors Guild Awards, Teen Choice Awards, MTV Movie Awards, and a host of other major awards shows.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="238c61f7807270466e0e60c4dabd5ce8"><name>rev-spring-13-alumni-profile-sanjayan</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Profile / M.

Sanjayan (biology Ph.D., '97) never expected to be a spokesperson, a TV personality, or a guest on the <em>Late Show with David Letterman.</em></p>
<p>But he found himself calming his nerves in the green room at the Ed Sullivan Theater, where he and the actor Jack Black waited their turns on the hot seat with Letterman.</p>
<p>Sanjayan admits to a case of nerves&#8212;"The show could have gone sideways," he said. "At one point I forgot my mother's name."</p>
<p>In the end, the show went just fine. Sanjayan, lead scientist for the Nature Conservancy&#8212;one of the most influential conservation groups in the country&#8212;even drew a chuckle from the host and a couple of good-sized laughs from the audience when he said that this generation "does not want to be remembered as a bunch of losers" who failed to save their own planet.</p>
<p>Besides, he's growing accustomed to surreal situations. His high-profile career keeps him traveling across the globe almost constantly and places him squarely in the public eye, whether he's reporting on Bangladeshi tigers, global warming, strange weather, extinctions, rising sea levels, or mega-fires.</p>
<p>Along the way, Sanjayan, who was born in Sri Lanka, was hailed as an advocate for diversity&#8212; in all its forms&#8212;in a Time magazine article entitled "Changing the White Face of the Green Movement."</p>
<p>While he's very happy to be an example for others, he says the picture is "changing, but bloody slowly."</p>
<p>UCSC played a decisive role in his present career. Though he admits that he is "not one of those people who loves being on television," he comes across as confident and very much in the know&#8212;two traits he attributes in large part to his graduate school experience here.</p>
<p>"While I was at UCSC I didn't think much about conservation," he said. "I mostly thought about taking on difficult questions." But his studies made him feel qualified to speak up.</p>
<p>"My mentor Michael Soul&#233; (now professor emeritus of environmental studies) told me that my job as a graduate student was to train myself as a critical thinker. The time to save something would come later, he told me," Sanjayan said. "At the same time, he was very clear, in his graduate seminars, that you could not lead a narrow life. Even though you're trained as a scientist, it doesn't exempt you from participating in public life."</p>
<p>These days, Sanjayan continues to embark on broadcasting adventures across the globe&#8212; he recently reported on Kenyan conservation advocates removing part of the tusks of live elephants to make them less attractive to poachers&#8212;while maintaining strong credentials in the scientific community.</p>
<p>"I am a scientist. I have a science background. I teach. I still read science papers and occasionally publish," he said. "This gives me the confidence to be in front of the camera."</p>
<p>He needs that confidence to address complex topics in ways that a lay audience can understand, and he needs that grounding to change minds about essential issues including climate change.</p>
<p>"It has to have this personal relevance to what impacts people's lives <em>today</em>," he said.</p>
<p>Extreme weather events, lack of snowfall, drought, and mega-fires have all done their part to change thinking, as did the devastation of Hurricane Sandy. In that storm's aftermath, he said, "you had some major people taking stances and saying what everyone else was merely thinking."&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="23e80017807270466e0e60c4b75271f9"><name>shaughnessy-guggenheim</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> UCSC alumna wins prestigious 2013 Guggenheim </title><summary>UCSC 1993 graduate Brenda Shaughnessy has been awarded a 2013 Guggenheim Fellowship for the creative arts in poetry.

<p>She is one of a diverse group of 175 scholars, artists, and scientists who were selected this year by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation from a group of 3,000 applicants.</p>
<p>Shaughnessy&#8217;s most recent collection of poetry is <em>Our Andromeda</em> (Copper Canyon Press, 2012).</p>
<p>The <em>New York Times Sunday Review of Books</em> gave the book a rave review, noting:<br/>
<br/>
<em>&#8220;Shaughnessy&#8217;s emotionally charged and gorgeously composed third volume of poems, &#8220;Our Andromeda,&#8221; moves me line by line and poem by poem so that by the book&#8217;s final, monumental title poem, I am top-of-the-head-blown-off undone. In &#8220;Our Andromeda&#8221; Shaughnessy has brought to bear her inevitable syntactic and sonic hula-hooping, her playful and ironic uses of form, her vivid mind on poems that absolutely matter.&#8221;</em><br/>
<br/>
Now living in Brooklyn, Shaughnessy is currently poetry editor-at-large at <em>Tin House</em> Magazine. She is also the author of two other poetry collections: <em>Human Dark with Sugar</em>, which was a finalist for the 2008 National Book Critics Circle Award; and <em>Interior with Sudden Joy</em>, a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Her poems have also appeared in such renowned venues as <em>Harpers, McSweeney&#8217;s, The New Yorker</em>, and <em>The Paris Review</em>.<br/>
<br/>
"I fell in love with Brenda Shaughnessy's book <em>Human Dark With Sugar</em>, and then was totally bowled over by her newest book, <em>Our Andromeda</em>,&#8221; said UCSC professor of literature Micah Perks, co-director of the UCSC Creative Writing Program. &#8220;I'm a huge fan.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Two decades ago at UC Santa Cruz</strong>, Shaughnessy was also a student of Feminist Studies professor Bettina Aptheker.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We are thrilled to welcome Brenda back to UCSC,&#8221; said Aptheker. &#8220;She graduated 20 years ago with a degree in Women's Studies and Literature, and all of us who worked with her have tracked her growing celebrity as a poet and teacher.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Aptheker noted that Shaughnessy will give a poetry reading on Thursday April 25, at 6 p.m. in the Humanities Lecture Hall as part of UCSC&#8217;s Living Writers series.<br/>
<br/>
She will also participate in a luncheon with UCSC undergraduate students at the Ethnic Resource Centers on April 26th from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30&#160; p.m. at their Bay Tree offices.</p>
<p>Shaughnessy will additionally present a talk titled <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/2013/events/feminist-poetry.html">"Feminism &amp; Poetry, Empowerment &amp; Passion,"</a> and appear on a faculty panel to discuss the latest developments in UCSC&#8217;s <a href="http://feministstudies.ucsc.edu/">Feminist Studies Department</a>--including the launch of its new <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/11/feminist-studies-degree.html">Feminist Studies graduate program</a>, the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/08/presidential-chair.html">UC Presidential Chair in Feminist Critical Race and Ethnic Studies</a>, the current curriculum, faculty research, and more&#8212;on&#160; Saturday, April 27, from 2 to 6 p.m. at the Humanities 1 building, Room 210.</p>
<p>All of these events are free and open to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;We welcome everyone to these joyous opportunities to hear a truly great poet share the passion and love of her work,&#8221; said Aptheker.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url/><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2406e24f807270466e0e60c44fa5ee8d"><name>rev-spring-13-alumni-profile-witter</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Profile / Lisa Witter: Speaking her truth</title><summary>Lisa Witter, partner and chief change officer of Fenton, the biggest public interest communications firm in the country, is a firm believer in the power of communications to advance social issues.</summary><start-date>1366358400000</start-date><display-name>Alumni Profile / Lisa Witter: Speaking her truth</display-name><path>/2013/04/rev-spring-13-alumni-profile-witter</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/rev-spring-13-alumni-profile-witter</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1366404030999</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1373930258772</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email>dwhite1@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/lisa witter.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/lisa witter.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lisa witter.jpg</name><display-name>lisa witter.jpg</display-name><file-size>37356</file-size><width>300</width><height>385</height></image><image-alt>Lisa Witter</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/lisa witter thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/lisa witter thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lisa witter thumb.jpg</name><display-name>lisa witter thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19988</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Lisa Witter</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>Lisa Witter (Stevenson '95, politics)&#160;</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Lisa Witter (Stevenson '95, politics) has five choice words for women who have something to say but haven't quite worked up the nerve to say it:</p>
<p>"Be brave. Go for it."</p>
<p>She encourages "the strategic suspension of humility for the sake of humanity."</p>
<p>A firm believer in the power of communications to advance social issues, Witter is partner and chief change officer of Fenton, the biggest public interest communications firm in the country. She focuses on behavior change, innovation, women's issues, and global affairs for clients including Desmond Tutu's The Elders and The Ford Foundation. She was named by the World Economic Forum as a Young Global Leader in 2010.</p>
<p>As an expert on politics, philanthropy, and women's issues; an activist; and a commentator on Fox News, MSNBC, and Fast Company, among many others, Witter clearly embodies her own philosophy.</p>
<p>"If you've been doing great things, if you have given a philanthropic gift, if you have a TED talk to give, then be brave up there, step in front of the loudspeaker and go for it."</p>
<p>"It might be a little bit scary," she added, "But this is for a wider cause. It is not just for you. This is your opportunity to be more public, and create change."</p>
<p>Consider that she once ran for the president of the United States. It was only a stunt for a Showtime reality series, but she shook hands with countless little girls and asked if they'd consider running for president for real. "Yes!" they replied in droves.</p>
<p>Born in Everett, Wash., Witter grew up in a household where neither parent went to college.</p>
<p>Her mother worked for 45 years in a paper mill. Her father grew up in North Dakota and served in Vietnam. Apparently his intense fear of public speaking did not get passed down to young Lisa, who sometimes got lost on purpose just to say her own name over the P.A. system. Even now she recalls that experience as "exhilarating."</p>
<p>Her time at UCSC honed her leadership philosophy and her attitude toward activism and social change, which emphasizes good humor, fun, and "engagement through the point of agreement" instead of brinkmanship.</p>
<p>"You have less conflict if you start with universal truths, such as, 'We all want to live in communities where there isn't violence,' not, 'The NRA is bad,'" she said. "To make people listen deeply, and for other reasons, I use humor, I have fun. Why does everything have to be so serious all the time?"</p>
<p>Witter is co-author with Lisa Chen of the cheekily titled book, <em>The She Spot: Why Women are the Market for Changing the World and How to Reach Them.</em> The book blows up the popular thinking that women are a "special interest" niche by showing that they make 83 percent of consumer decisions, were an essential determining factor in the last several presidential elections, and give the most to nonprofits.</p>
<p>"We're not a niche," she said. "We're the majority. The only place where we're missing is in positions of power."</p>
<p>Her work sends her all over the world, including Dubai, where she serves as a member of the Global Agenda Council on Neuroscience and Behavior Change&#8212;and, to her surprise, where she ran into a fellow Banana Slug.</p>
It just goes to show, she said, that UCSC alumni "are in the highest places doing the most interesting work grounded in a passion for making the world a better place."&#160;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2427dcd2807270466e0e60c47242dd1d"><name>rev-spring-13-alumni-philanthropy-rhodes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Philanthropy Focus / Karen Rhodes: Giving back by paying forward</title><summary>Karen Rhodes has been a student, public information officer, development staff member, and an Alumni Councilor at UCSC. &#13;

Over the years, she's been a student, public information officer, development staff member, and an Alumni Councilor.</p>
<p>But one thing hasn't changed throughout the years: She and her husband, fellow Slug Robert Weiner (College Eight '83, environmental studies), have been consistent, reliable donors to UC Santa Cruz, providing valuable support for Cowell College, the History Department, College Eight, Environmental Studies, and scholarships.</p>
<p>Last year, the couple joined with other Banana Slugs to start the Environmental Studies Experiential Learning Endowment, which helps fund experiential learning courses that build on classroom studies, while training students to address 21st century environmental challenges.</p>
<p>"We saw a need to move the initiative forward," said Rhodes.</p>
<p>So far, donors have raised $250,000 toward the $1 million goal for this endowment campaign, dubbed "Training Environmental Problem Solvers."</p>
<p>Karen Holl, professor and chair of the Environmental Studies Department, praised Rhodes and Weiner for supporting UCSC hands-on learning courses in general as well as the Natural History Field Quarter.</p>
<p>Holl said these generous alumni gifts will help ensure that environmental studies professors can conduct small field courses that teach critical thinking skills to future generations of UCSC students.</p>
<p>For Rhodes, it's a question of paying it forward. She found herself referring back to her UCSC experience throughout her working life.</p>
<p>"I draw on my UC education all the time to keep myself honest and aligned with my core values," said Rhodes. She added that UCSC was a great place to be for students who felt comfortable with professors, lecturers, books, and fellow students "pushing us to think for ourselves."</p>
<p>Such skills came in handy when Rhodes started out as a journalist. Soon after graduation, she started a news program at KZSC. Instead of going to broadcasting school, she learned through experience. "We taught ourselves how to do radio news reporting," Rhodes said.</p>
<p>She began freelancing for alternative weeklies in town, covering local politics and environmental issues.</p>
<p>At KUSP radio, she started working in development, and later she worked in UCSC's University Relations office. She met her husband through mutual friends.</p>
<p>Rhodes and Weiner left Santa Cruz in 1988, when Robert took a job at UC San Francisco. Rhodes answered a classified ad for an editorial director at UC Berkeley, where she works today.</p>
<p>But the two of them remain closely connected to UC Santa Cruz through their giving.</p>
<p>For Rhodes and Weiner, giving comes naturally; it's simply a matter of giving back. But there's also a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>As the state contribution to the UC system has dwindled "it's even more important for alumni and friends to contribute," Rhodes said.</p>
<p>Rhodes has provided for UCSC in her estate planning. She believes it's important to set up the fewest possible restrictions on using the funds.</p>
<p>"I've always wanted to leave a legacy with my estate and to do something with my assets that is going to have a lasting impact," said Rhodes. "I want to focus on giving to UCSC in a way that's as unfettered as possible."</p>
<p>Gifts of all sizes have an impact, she said.</p>
<p>"There's an important and catalytic role that can be played in development even if it's not in a big way."</p>

<br/>
Ginny has accumulated a lengthy list of accomplishments since her arrival on campus in 2005, most notably her masterful oversight of the renovation, expansion, and modernization of McHenry Library. Although that project is perhaps the most visible mark of her impact on campus, it is far from the only valued and lasting contribution she has made to UCSC. <br/>
<br/>
Ginny has worked diligently to acquire important collections that support teaching and research across campus, and she has raised visibility and awareness of the University Library in ways that increase the name recognition of UC Santa Cruz. The Grateful Dead Archive is just one example of her extraordinary contributions. Behind the scenes, Ginny has built relationships and shored up public and private support for our libraries in ways that will benefit the campus for decades.<br/>
<br/>
Ginny's tenure at UCLA will begin July 15. I will share news regarding the appointment of an interim librarian and the search for a successor. Meanwhile, please join me in congratulating Ginny on her new opportunity. Although I will miss her deeply as a colleague, I am glad the UC system will continue to benefit from her talent and leadership. <br/>

Para: la comunidad de la Universidad de California en Santa Cruz<br/>
De parte de: Campus Provost y Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway<br/>
Sobre: Partida de la bibliotecaria de la Universidad Virginia Steel<br/>
<br/>
Lamento anunciar la partida de la bibliotecaria de nuestra Universidad Virginia Steel, que nos deja para tomar el cargo de bibliotecaria de la Universidad en la UCLA.<br/>
<br/>
Ginny ha acumulado una larga lista de logros desde su llegada al campus en 2005, sobretodo la supervisi&#243;n magistral de la renovaci&#243;n, ampliaci&#243;n y modernizaci&#243;n de la Biblioteca McHenry. Aunque este proyecto es tal vez la marca m&#225;s visible de su impacto en el campus, est&#225; lejos de ser la &#250;nica valiosa y duradera contribuci&#243;n que ha hecho a la UCSC.<br/>
<br/>
Ginny ha trabajado diligentemente para adquirir colecciones importantes que apoyen la ense&#241;anza y la investigaci&#243;n en el campus y asimismo ha elevado la visibilidad y conocimiento de la Biblioteca de la Universidad de manera que aumente el reconocimiento del nombre de la UC Santa Cruz. El Archivo de Grateful Dead es solo un ejemplo de sus extraordinarias contribuciones. Detr&#225;s de la escena, Ginny ha establecido relaciones y apuntalado el apoyo p&#250;blico y privado para nuestras bibliotecas en una forma que beneficiar&#225; al campus durante d&#233;cadas.<br/>
<br/>
El cargo como bibliotecaria en la UCLA va a comenzar el 15 de julio. Voy a compartir con ustedes las noticias con respecto a la designaci&#243;n de una bibliotecaria interina o un bibliotecario interino y la b&#250;squeda de una sucesora o un sucesor. Mientras tanto, les pido que me acompa&#241;en en felicitar a Ginny en su nueva oportunidad. Aunque la voy a extra&#241;ar inmensamente como colega, estoy contenta de que el sistema de la UC continuar&#225; benefici&#225;ndose con su talento y liderazgo.<br/>

<br/>
Alanna was a first-year student during the 2011-12 academic year and lived at Cowell in Prescott House.&#160; Her intended major was Environmental Studies. She took a leave of absence this year, was living in Santa Cruz, and was planning to re-enroll at UCSC.</p>
<p>Alanna was from the Santa Barabara area and graduated from San Marcos High School.&#160; Those who knew her there described her as a kind, creative, and extraordinary young woman.</p>

<h3>With finals a week away, we&#8217;d like to wish all our students the best of luck! We&#8217;d also like to welcome them to their temporary new home (McHenry Library).</h3>
<p><em><strong>Danielle Langman:</strong> I miss McHenry. Regardless of how many painful hours were spent slaving away on papers, it was always refreshing to look out the window and see the beautiful redwood trees.</em></p>
<h3>Mad love out to our Banana Slug family today! Do you have a UCSC love story? Share it with us!</h3>
<p><em><strong>Colleen Jendreas:</strong> Met my husband on move in day at College 8 in</em> Sept. 2001. Been married 5 years now with a 1 year old son. It was Slug love at first sight!</p>
<h3>The last time the San Francisco 49ers won the SuperBowl was 1994, which happens to be the same year Vincent Vega wore a Banana Slugs shirt in the movie <em>Pulp Fiction.</em> Coincidence? Not likely. What were you doing in 1994?</h3>
<p><em><strong>Theda Weston:</strong> Freshman at Porter College and watched Pulp Fiction downtown! Go 49ers!</em></p>
<h3>UCSC has lost a great friend. Do you have memories of Don Rothman, our beloved teacher of writing? Please feel free to share.</h3>
<em><strong>Deborah Baeza:</strong> When I arrived at UCSC, I liked to write. By the time I left, I LOVED it. RIP, Don Rothman.</em></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2492b8c7807270466e0e60c4b4b918ad"><name>spring-plant-sale</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Farm &amp; Garden’s annual spring plant sale set for weekend of May 4, 5</title><summary>Satisfy your green thumb at the UCSC Farm and Garden’s spring plant sale, featuring the region’s largest collection of organically grown herb and flower starts, vegetables, and perennials Saturday, May 4, and Sunday, May 5.</summary><start-date>1366412400000</start-date><display-name>2013 Spring plant sale</display-name><path>/2013/04/spring-plant-sale</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/spring-plant-sale</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1366413195401</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1366413809872</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title></title><phone/><email>mtbrown@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/plant_sale-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/plant_sale-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>plant_sale-375.jpg</name><display-name>plant_sale-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>116371</file-size><width>375</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt>seedlings in greenhouse </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/plant_sale_seedlings-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/plant_sale_seedlings-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>plant_sale_seedlings-80.jpg</name><display-name>plant_sale_seedlings-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>23668</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>A wide variety of seedlings are cultivated in the greenhouse at the Farm in anticipation of the annual spring plant sale.

The symposium will advance an integrated understanding of the effects of aging on stem cells and how stem cells can be used to treat age-related diseases, an emerging field in which UC is already doing pioneering work.</p>
<p>Keynote speaker Judith Campisi, a world-renowned researcher from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, will speak on the enormous promise of stem cell therapies and the challenges that aging presents to the use of these therapies. Campisi is widely recognized for her work on senescent cells--older cells that have stopped dividing--and their influence on aging and cancer. Recently her lab has been investigating the effect of this process on adult stem cells.</p>
<p>Other presentations will address underexplored areas of investigation at the intersection of stem cell biology and aging. Sessions include "Insights on aging from the embryo," "Aging of tissue-specific stem cells," "Aging and the stem cell niche," and "Epigenetics and aging."</p>
<p>Organized by the UCSC <a href="http://stemcell.soe.ucsc.edu/">Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells</a>, the symposium is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.cirm.ca.gov/">California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</a> (CIRM), the <a href="http://qb3.org/">California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences</a> (QB3), the <a href="http://www.ellisonfoundation.org/">Ellison Medical Foundation</a>, and the University of California Research Opportunity Fund. Program directors are Camilla Forsberg, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UCSC, and Lindsay Hinck, professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology at UCSC.</p>
<p>Details and registration information are available online at <a href="http://stemcell.soe.ucsc.edu/symposium_2013">stemcell.soe.ucsc.edu/symposium_2013</a>.

<p>The 2013 Leiden Ranking from the Center for Science and Technology Studies of Leiden University is based on data from the Web of Science bibliographic database produced by Thomson Reuters. The annual ranking aims to provide accurate measurements of the scientific impact of universities and of universities' involvement in scientific collaboration. Scientific impact is determined by several indicators, including the average number of citations of the publications of a university and the proportion of the publications of a university that, compared with other publications in the same field and in the same year, belong in the top 10 percent of the most frequently cited papers.</p>
<p>UCSC has received high rankings in a number of different analyses that look at the same kinds of data using different methodologies. For example, UCSC ranked second for research influence in the Times Higher Education (THE) <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/10/research-influence.html">World University Rankings 2012-13</a>, published last year.</p>
<p>The 2013 Leiden Ranking is based on Web of Science indexed publications from the period 2008&#8211;2011. It includes the 500 universities worldwide with the largest publication output in the Web of Science database.</p>
<p>Other UC campuses on the list include UC Santa Barbara (ranked 2nd), UC Berkeley (7th), UCSF (9th), UC San Diego (15th), and UCLA (25th).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="38b59ca1807270466e0e60c4f2404280"><name>shakespeare-jewelll-collaboration</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Shakespeare Santa Cruz collaborates with Jewel Theatre for Pinter plays</title><summary>UCSC’s Shakespeare Santa Cruz has joined forces with Santa Cruz’s Jewel Theatre Company to present two one-act plays by Harold Pinter, running April 25 through May 19, at the Center Stage in downtown Santa Cruz.</summary><keywords>shakespeare santa cruz, ucsc, uc santa cruz, santa cruz theater, UCSC Arts Division, Paul Whitworth, Jewell Theater</keywords><start-date>1366752600000</start-date><display-name>Shakespeare Santa Cruz collaborates with Jewel Theatre for Pinter double bill</display-name><path>/2013/04/shakespeare-jewelll-collaboration</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/shakespeare-jewelll-collaboration</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1366751026255</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1366917312774</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/Lg-Playbill-Road.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/Lg-Playbill-Road.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Lg-Playbill-Road.jpg</name><display-name>Lg-Playbill-Road.jpg</display-name><file-size>95035</file-size><width>203</width><height>259</height></image><image-alt>playbill--Harold Pinter plays</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/ssc-jewel-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/ssc-jewel-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ssc-jewel-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ssc-jewel-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26000</file-size><width>81</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>playbill--Harold Pinter plays</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/ryan-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/ryan-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ryan-300.jpg</name><display-name>ryan-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>42310</file-size><width>300</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt>Mike Ryan &amp;

<p>The double bill will feature <em><strong>One for the Road</strong></em>, directed by SSC artistic director Marco Barricelli, and <em><strong>The Lover</strong></em>, directed by Jewel Theatre founder and artistic director Julie James.</p>
<p><em><strong>One for the Road</strong></em> stars UCSC Theater Arts professor and former SSC artistic director Paul Whitworth, along with 14-year SSC veteran actor Mike Ryan, Julie James and Diego Hammana.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
The play is a powerful political drama about the doomed members of a family, kidnapped by the authorities in an unknown country, who are subjected to an interrogator as they struggle to retain their last bit of dignity.<br/>
<br/>
In the second one-act, <em><strong>The Lover</strong></em>, the social convention of marriage clashes with primal sensuality as a husband and wife undergo an internal struggle for identity and an external struggle for power. Sexy, unsettling and funny, this play also features Ryan, plus Cristina Anselmo and Andrew Davids.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
B. Modern&#8212;who has designed more than 40 shows for SSC--will be making her debut at Jewel Theatre as costume designer for this production.<br/>
<br/>
Other SSC alumni involved in the collaboration are Norman Kern (sound design) Jessica Carter (wig designer), and Bec Shipman (assistant stage manager), plus SSC&#8217;s production administrator Jessica Storey Bond, who will serve as production assistant.<br/>
<br/>
Now in its seventh year, <a href="http://www.jeweltheatre.net/">Jewel Theatre Company</a> is the only year-round professional theatre company in Santa Cruz County.<br/>
<br/>
The company recently moved into their new home at Center Stage (formerly Actors&#8217; Theatre) in downtown Santa Cruz. Their seasons are eclectic, ranging from drama and musicals to comedy and classics.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, <a href="http://www.shakespearesantacruz.org/">Shakespeare Santa Cruz</a> announced the line-up for its summer season, noting that for the first time in the company&#8217;s history, all shows will take place outdoors among the redwoods in the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen.</p>
<p>Running July 23 to September 1, the 2013 season will open with Shakespeare&#8217;s popular and thought-provoking comedy, <strong><em>The Taming of the Shrew</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The season will also feature the final play in SSC&#8217;s making-of-a-king trilogy, <em><strong>Henry V</strong></em>, plus this year&#8217;s annual Fringe show, <em><strong>Tom Jones</strong></em>, a bawdy and rollicking comedy adapted by Jon Jory from the classic Henry Fielding novel.</p>
<p>A public SSC season preview event is set for Bookshop Santa Cruz on Tuesday, June 4, beginning at 7:30 p.m.&#8232; Admission is free, and the community is welcome.&#8232;&#8232;</p>

Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley</article-subhead><article-text><p>Games have the power to transform the way stories are told. New ways to craft and deliver narratives using advanced game designs and technologies will be the focus of <a href="http://ifog.soe.ucsc.edu/">Inventing the Future of Games 2013: Interactive Storytelling Symposium</a> on Friday, May 10, at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View.</p>
<p>Sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/games-and-playable-media">Center for Games and Playable Media</a>, the symposium will bring together leading game designers and experts from both academia and the game industry to discuss the future of interactive storytelling. Speakers will include <strong>Warren Spector</strong>, creator of <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Epic Mickey</em>; <strong>Clint Hocking</strong>, lead designer of <em>Far Cry 2</em>; <strong>Susan Bonds</strong>, CEO of 42Entertainment; <strong>Emily Short</strong>, interactive fiction writer and creator of <em>Versu</em>; and UCSC computer science professor <strong>Michael Mateas</strong>, creator of <em>Fa&#231;ade</em> and director of the Center for Games and Playable Media.&#160;</p>
<p>Mateas's <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/eis">Expressive Intelligence Studio</a> at UC Santa Cruz does pioneering work in the use of advanced artificial intelligence for interactive storytelling. His group has developed technologies to push the boundaries of interactive drama, creating autonomous virtual characters and simulations of social dynamics that enable complex social interactions between players and virtual characters in a game.</p>
<p>Keynote speaker Warren Spector is a long-time advocate of better stories in games. His visionary work leading innovative projects has pushed the boundaries of game narrative. As the studio head of Ion Storm in Austin, he oversaw two seminal franchises, <em>Thief</em> and <em>Deus Ex,</em> both of which broke new ground in immersive storytelling techniques and are considered seminal works today.</p>
<p>New developments in interactive storytelling include complex virtual characters, dynamic drama management systems, and an expanding range of storytelling media. Film-makers craft interactive documentary experiences, while game-makers create richly immersive digital worlds steeped with narrative moments, and more exciting innovations are on the horizon, according to Jane Pinckard, associate director of the Center for Games and Playable Media.</p>
<p>"For this symposium, we've collected the top people in the world, from both the academic sphere as well as the game industry. These are the ones who are pushing the boundaries of interactive narrative every day," Pinckard said.</p>

<br/>
It may have been a test for the East Los Angeles native to balance studies in political theory with raising a young family while also working but it was consistent with a desire to challenge himself.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Sotelo is a Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge, appointed in 2002 by Gov. Gray Davis and reelected in 2010. And he's winner of the 2013 Distinguished Social Sciences Alumni Award at UCSC.<br/>
<br/>
The award is presented each year to a Social Sciences graduate whose career is characterized by sustained and exemplary contributions to society through research, practice, education, policy, or service. It will be presented Friday afternoon at a reception at the Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab in conjunction with Alumni Reunion Weekend.<br/>
<br/>
"David was a great inspiration to me during our undergraduate days," wrote David Korduner (Merrill, '85, politics) in nominating Sotelo. "He was thoughtful and wise, generous and kind, humble and hard working. He was the kind of person that I could only hope to become,"<br/>
<br/>
"It was a great experience," Sotelo recalls of his UCSC days. "I was older, a parent, and a homeowner. Most of my fellow students were considerably younger, a few clearly attempting to discover a 'counter-culture' experience their parents may have had."<br/>
<br/>
He remembers his classmates as "fun people asking important questions, not going to college just to get a job."<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Early choice</strong></p>
<p>Sotelo said he chose UCSC while still in Balboa High School in San Francisco. Though born in Los Angeles, the son of a Baptist minister, his family moved to San Francisco when he was 10, living in the Mission and Excelsior districts.<br/>
<br/>
It was the early 1970s and he was in the school library. "I saw a Santa Cruz catalog, saw a photo of students living in a teepee and said 'That's were I want to go.'"<br/>
<br/>
His path to Santa Cruz was a circuitous one when his plans changed and he wanted to attend art school that included a scholarship. That morphed into a year at California Baptist University in Riverside after his father insisted he go to a Baptist college instead.<br/>
<br/>
The next summer, back in San Francisco, he met a young woman he'd known in fifth grade. They married, she attended San Francisco State &#8211; carrying their newly born first son on stage when she received her degree &#8211; then graduate school at San Jose State. Sotelo put school on hold and started waiting tables to support the family.<br/>
<br/>
His wife, Margaret Leal-Sotelo, later got a lecturer's job at Cabrillo College, and the family moved to Felton. (Today, she is an assistant provost in the UCLA's executive vice chancellor's office.)<br/>
<br/>
&#160;In the early '80s, Sotelo went back to school, taking summer classes at UCSC, son number two was born, and he got a job waiting tables at Deer Park Tavern.<br/>
<br/>
When he graduated he had thoughts of pursuing a Ph.D. in the history of consciousness. His wife sat him down: "'How many waiters have Ph.D's?'" she asked, and he opted for UCLA law school.</p>
<p><strong>Love for criminal law</strong></p>
<p>"I fell in love with criminal law," he said. "It's applied philosophy &#8211; how we live together &#8211; and politics all wrapped in one."<br/>
<br/>
His first job out of law school was in a Beverly Hills law office. Two years later he wanted to apply to the public defender's office so he could defend poor people accused of crimes. Then a law school professor told him that as a new attorney "you will make a mistake, everyone does. Who should pay for your mistakes? Your client sitting next to you?"<br/>
<br/>
"I thought I should challenge myself," he said, and also applied to the district attorney's office.<br/>
<br/>
Both offices offered him a job. Both offices were in the same building but on different floors. "The question was, on that Monday, at 8:30 in the morning, which floor do I go to?"<br/>
<br/>
"I challenged myself &#8211; and got off on the prosecutors' floor."<br/>
<br/>
&#160;Sotelo said his years as a prosecutor opened his eyes. "All the victims looked like my people," he said. "I'd tell my friends, 'I am a civil rights attorney.' I am representing poor people."<br/>
<br/>
In the aftermath of the Rodney King beating, Sotelo was recruited to be part of a team prosecuting police and government officials accused of abuse or other criminal activity. It wasn't long before "I knew I had to do something else" and he received an appointment as a Court Commissioner in East L.A.</p>
<p><strong>Successful drug court</strong></p>
<p>As a Court Commissioner he was challenged to help start a non-adversarial drug court in East L.A. It's a cooperative approach for hard-core addicts in which the district attorney, public defender, judge, and a contract vendor work as a team to help addicts keep themselves clean. Daily drug tests are part of the program along with counseling.<br/>
<br/>
Of 17 drug courts in Los Angeles County, Sotelo says his was the most successful. "I felt like I was back in my dad's church, guys who graduated would cry."<br/>
<br/>
Ten years ago, after his appointment to the superior court, he helped start a teen court at a Los Angeles high school. That work, challenging teens to examine their behavior, continues today.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to presiding over criminal trials, Sotelo is also working with the Museum of Tolerance to hold teen courts on issues of intolerance. In the program called SHADES (Stopping Hate and Delinquency by Empowering Students), teens take testimony from victims and suspects and pass sentences.<br/>
<br/>
"It's a variation of teen court," he said, "our focus is on bullying."<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Huerta, who recently celebrated her 83rd birthday, has played a major role in the American civil rights movement for more than 50 years.&#160; In 1962, with C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez, she co-founded the National Farm Workers Association, which would later become United Farm Workers union. Ch&#225;vez died 20 years ago at age 66.<br/>
<br/>
She led the national table grape boycott in support of the farm workers strike, bringing the plight of farm workers to the forefront of the American consumer. The boycott was supported by an estimated 17 million Americans and led to the passage of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act, the first law granting farm workers the right to collectively organize and bargain for better wages and working conditions.<br/>
<br/>
In 1975, she pushed for legislation granting amnesty to farm workers who had lived, worked, and paid taxes in the United States for many years but were not extended the privileges of citizenship. Her efforts resulted in the Immigration Act of 1985 in which 1.4 million farm workers received amnesty.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, she was inducted into the U.S. Department of Labor Hall of Honor and President Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. This past March she was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Huerta is the president of the Dolores Huerta Foundation where she continues her work as an advocate for women&#8217;s rights, and reproductive freedom. She continues working to develop community leaders, for working poor, immigrants, women, and youth.&#160; Huerta is a tireless participant on organizational forums and programs that focus on issues of social justice and public policy.<br/>
<br/>
She is a founding board member of the Feminist Majority Foundation and also serves on the board of Ms. Magazine.&#160; She has received numerous awards including the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award from President Clinton in 1998. In 1997, Ms. named her one of the three most important women of the year.<br/>
<br/>
She is a former UC Regent and has earned 11 honorary doctorates from universities throughout the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Huerta spoke at the first C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez Convocation at UCSC in 2004. The convocation is produced by College Ten Co-Curricular Programs, El Centro-Chicano Latino Resource Center and C.A.R.E. (Community and Resource Empowerment e2).</p>
<p>Sponsors include the UCSC Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, the Divisions of Humanities and Graduate Studies, Provosts of Colleges Nine and Ten, Cowell, Porter, and Oake, and MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl&#225;n).<br/>
<br/>
Co-sponsors include The Center for Labor Studies, Latin American and Latino studies, Division of Social Sciences, Provosts of Kresge, Merrill, and College Eight, the Dean of Students and Campus Life, Retention Services the College Senates of Cowell, Crown, Eight, Kresge, Merrill, Nine, Oakes, Porter, Stevenson and Ten.<br/>

<br/>
The fellowships will provide Madeleine Kerrick and Grace Sumabat-Estrada with three years funding for doctoral research.<br/>
<br/>
Kerrick, who is working with professor Avril Thorne, will conduct a longitudinal study of the prenatal experiences of a diverse sample of first-time mothers. Her study focuses on women&#8217;s experiences during prenatal visits with primary care providers, and will follow women from their second trimester to postpartum.<br/>
<br/>
Her research aims to understand how interactions with prenatal providers, a neglected context in studies of maternal development, relate to a sense of maternal self-efficacy postpartum.<br/>
<br/>
Sumabat-Estrada, who is is working with professor Margarita Azmitia, will conduct intervention studies with ethnically diverse samples of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students at a community college and a four-year university.<br/>
<br/>
Her study focuses on how a sense of belonging and affiliation with one&#8217;s ethnic heritage is associated with students&#8217; academic self-efficacy, well being, and academic motivation. Her project aims to increase understanding of the STEM experiences of mixed-heritage students, one of the fastest&#8211;growing demographics in the U.S.&#160;<br/>

Clauser, a pioneering aeronautical engineer who served as a vice chancellor at UC Santa Cruz in the 1960s, died on March 3, 2013, at age 99.</p>
<p>Clauser, who came to UCSC from Johns Hopkins University in 1965, served as vice chancellor for academic affairs; he was later named vice chancellor for science and engineering. He was hired by Chancellor Dean McHenry to spearhead the development of an engineering program at UCSC. Clauser also worked closely with Lick Observatory and was involved in the development of the marine sciences program.</p>
<p>After the UC Office of the President decided to postpone the engineering program at UCSC, Clauser left the campus in 1969 to become chair of the Division of Engineering and Applied Science at the California Institute of Technology, where he had earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees.

<br/>
Directed by the students&#8217; Language instructors, the four public performances will feature works in French, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, accompanied by English super-titles.<br/>
<br/>
Admission is free, and the community is invited.<br/>
<br/>
This year's program features excerpts from <em>Le Malade Imaginaire</em> (The Hypochondriac) by <strong>Moli&#232;re</strong>; <em>Nativit&#224;</em> (Nativity) by <strong>La Smorfia</strong>; <em>The Vampire Cabbie</em> by <strong>Haruki Murakami</strong>; and <em>Las Luci&#233;rnagas Del Caribe</em> (Caribbean Fireflies) by <strong>Emilio Carballido</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
The presentation of theater productions in languages other than English has a long tradition at UCSC, going all the way back to the 1970s.</p>
<p>Since 1972, when language lecturer Miriam Ellis offered a program of theater and music in French, students of French have annually performed fully-staged productions in the language for campus and community audiences.</p>
<p>In 2001, several other language lecturers at UCSC joined Ellis in creating the <a href="http://language.ucsc.edu/news-events/profiles/international-playhouse.html">International Playhouse</a>. The first year's program featured scenes in Chinese, French, German, Italian, and Japanese.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, students of eight languages have performed in the project--presenting works ranging from medieval traditional pieces, to classical theater of the 17th century, to modern plays from the theater of the absurd, to original works written by faculty and students.</p>
<p>&#8220;The International Playhouse is a unique project and, as far as we can ascertain, the only one of its kind in academic institutions,&#8221; said Ellis.</p>
<p>Ellis noted that for the past five years, the International Playhouse has performed to capacity audiences for its four annual free performances, typically offering a program of at least four different languages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the years, the annual presentations have represented an important outreach event for UCSC and have attracted a loyal following. In addition to those on campus, many community members, as well as faculty and students from high schools and Cabrillo College, attend regularly,&#8221; she added.&#160;<br/>

The Lamat Summer Research Program on High-Performance Computing in Astrophysics gives students the opportunity to work with UCSC faculty and graduate students on projects using some of the world's most advanced computers.</p>
<p>Sponsorship as a National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (NSF REU) site, awarded this year, has enabled UC Santa Cruz to expand the program, which began on a smaller scale in 2009 with Hartnell College in Salinas. Led by Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, an associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, the Lamat program (lamat is the Mayan word for star) now includes Hartnell, Cabrillo College in Santa Cruz, Monterey Peninsula College in Monterey, and De Anza College in Cupertino.</p>
<p>"The program with Hartnell has been very successful. We now have about nine transfer students from Hartnell in the physics department. Our first graduate, Ricky Fernandez, went to Columbia University to pursue a Ph.D. in astronomy, and this year three more are going on to Ph.D. programs," said Ramirez-Ruiz.</p>
<p>The goal of the internships is not just to train astrophysicists, but to use astrophysical simulations as an exciting medium for imparting a broad array of scientific skills to the participants, he said. As high-performance computing becomes a routine tool, industry and government employers will seek graduates with expertise in this field. The broad physics palette of astrophysical simulations makes them an ideal training ground for many job situations.</p>
<p>The Lamat program also aims to encourage more Hispanic community college students to transfer to UCSC and pursue degrees in the so-called STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Many Hispanic students attend community colleges such as Hartnell, where they comprise 60 percent of the student population, but relatively few of them earn STEM degrees. The Lamat program will increase the retention and graduation rates for minority students at community colleges through a comprehensive program of research instruction, mentoring, workshops, and support programs at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"We're basically discovering untapped talent in communities where people have not had these kinds of opportunities," Ramirez-Ruiz said. "It's a way we can bring talented students to our campus who otherwise wouldn't come."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has a dedicated supercomputer facility for use by undergraduate students. Ramirez-Ruiz helped establish the Supercomputer Lab for Undergraduates (SLUG) with funding from his <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2008/10/2491.html">Packard Fellowship</a> and from NSF and NASA grants.</p>
<p>UCSC also has the largest group of computational astrophysicists in the world, with 17 faculty members in three departments: Astronomy and Astrophysics, Earth and Planetary Sciences, and Physics. They use computer simulations to study exploding stars, black holes, planetary dynamics, galaxy formation, dark matter, and much more. Computer simulations have been called the third pillar of science, complementing theoretical and experimental approaches to complex problems.</p>
<p>Students in the Lamat program will learn basic computer programming skills in a five-day computer science "boot camp" during the winter break preceding their summer internships. The program also includes outreach to students' families. Ramirez-Ruiz said he plans to develop a "Family Astronomy Night" series of public lectures (some in Spanish) at the partner community colleges.</p>
<p>The NSF REU grant will provide approximately $380,000 over three years. The co-investigators of the successful proposal include UCSC undergraduate research coordinator Rebecca Anderson, STEM diversity programs director Malika Bell, and faculty members Charlie Conroy, Jonathan Fortney, and Mark Krumholz in astronomy and astrophysics, Francis Nimmo in Earth and planetary sciences, Tesla Jeltema in physics, and Jennifer Parker in art.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="578c7138807270464f71d691cebf03d7"><name>ucsc-talent-show</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC's Talent Show debuts, showcases students' artistic flair</title><summary>They made a Britney Spears song sound hip.

They sent machetes flying, flung yo-yos, and danced fingers over the keys of a grand piano.</p>
<p>On a brightly lit stage Friday night in the Stevenson Event Center, 20 of UC Santa Cruz's most creative student performers came together for the premiere of UCSC's Talent Show, a campus-wide competition that showcased the university's artistic flair.</p>
<p>Said Chancellor George Blumenthal during a break: "UCSC <em>really</em> does have talent."</p>
<p>The nearly three-hour competition was won by a pair of 21-year-old singer/songwriters: Sean Campbell (College Eight '14, environmental sciences) and Casey Dayan (College Eight '14, anthropology/literature), who blew away the standing-room-only crowd with their sweet harmonies and a beautifully crafted song titled "Mother," which they'd written that week.</p>
<p>"We're stoked," said Dayan after learning their duo, called "Moo," had won the $2,000 Alumni Association scholarship prize (see video at right). "Everyone here did just a freaking amazing job."</p>
<p>Organized by students Samantha Vega, Shaz Umer, and Rashad Kayed, along with Associate Vice Chancellor/Enrollment Management Michelle Whittingham and a host of volunteers, the talent show was "a way to define us as a campus," said Umer. Whittingham hopes the competition will become an annual event tied to Alumni Weekend festivities</p>
<p>Modeled after the reality TV show "America's Got Talent," the event drew 90 contestants over five preliminary heats, whittling the talent pool down to the top 10 acts, who took the stage Friday night.</p>
<p>Luke Romero (Oakes '14, network and digital technology) opened the show with a mind-boggling display of choreographed yo-yo maneuvers that drew hoots and cheers from the audience. Flipping, spinning, and forming almost-architectural structures, Romero's yo-yo was like living art.</p>
<p>"I like seeing the flow of movement from any kind of art: dance, parkour, yo-yo," said Romero, who has been perfecting his skills for nine years.</p>
<p>What followed was an all-you-can-eat buffet of talents. Twenty-year-old music major Emily Walters performed a self-choreographed Irish dance. Crown economics and math major Daniel Steinberg and College Ten psychology major Alex Clark &#8212; who had met only five days before &#8212; set the crowd on fire with a bluesy R&amp;B rendition of Britney Spears' "Oops I Did it Again."</p>
<p>And in an act guaranteed to stop the heart of any insurance adjuster, 20-year-old Cowell College student and human biology major Michael Balce rode a towering unicycle through the crowd while juggling machetes as his street-performing crew &#8212; Jack Milner, Alec Vigil, and Daniel Martins, all 19 and all from Cowell College &#8212;played rock behind him.</p>
<p>For 20-year-old Andrew Kang (College Nine '15, technology information management) the talent show was the first chance for him and his two dance partners to perform their homage to the funk dance styles of locking and popping in front of an audience.</p>
<p>Pausing the group's warm-up minutes before the show, he said he met 19-year-old Benjamin Du (College Eight '15, robotics engineering) and 24-year-old computer science transfer student Che-An Wu, who came to UCSC from Taiwan, only a few months before. They discovered a shared passion for dance and became friends.</p>
<p>"Dance is a universal language," Kang said.</p>
<p>&#160;Their act, titled "UCSC Popping: Funk the System," brought down the house and earned them a final-three spot, along with pianist Ashley Tran, a 19-year-old music major from Porter College who has been playing since the age of 5.</p>
<p>Judges Whittingham, Umer, Dean of Students Alma Sifuentes, and UCSC Chief of Police Nader Oweis used words like "unexpected," "amazing," and "emotion-filled" to describe the acts. And despite a technological snafu with voting that resulted in an old-fashioned head count, the show was a success.</p>

<p>A group of student volunteers at the base of campus jumped, cheered, and urged alumni to honk their horns. They held banners that said, "We missed you!" and "Welcome to your happy place!"</p>
<p>More than 1,000 revelers participated enthusiastically in all activities, whether they were immersing themselves in dream research, video games, and other topics at a special "Teach-In" event, honoring founding Oakes provost J. Herman Blake or memorializing his colleague, the beloved writing lecturer Don Rothman, attending the festive annual Dizikes Concert highlighting the Madrigals and a cappella groups, or taking off on a "Then and Now Alumni Walking Tour" leaving from Porter Circle.</p>
<p>It was all part of this year's immersive UCSC Alumni Weekend festivities, which emphasized fun, informality, good vibes, friendship, food, and reinforced connections with friends and faculty.</p>
<p>As returning alumni approached Porter College&#8212;where many events were scheduled this year&#8212;they heard the acoustic musical stylings of the Coffis Brothers before proceeding to a deliriously silly <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ucsantacruz/sets/72157633373304400/">open-air "photo booth</a>," where they tried on fuzzy banana slug hats, waved Slug banners, and tried on a Slug "mustache"a banana slug-shaped refrigerator magnet sprayed gold and mounted on a stick. They also contributed to the shared sense of nostalgia by contributing to <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/alumniweekend/2013/alumni-weekend-photos.html">an online photo album</a>.</p>
<p>Alumni also gathered around Porter College's famous koi pond&#8212;a powerful memory trigger for UCSC graduates.</p>
<p>Jake Wickenheiser (Cowell '95, sociology) reflected on all the life-changing analytical skills he picked up as a student. He also had some words for the giant white-orange, black, violet, and gray fish, which swam right up to him as if recognizing and old, familiar face.</p>
<p>"I used to feed you," he said, addressing one fish in particular. "You remember me?"</p>
<p>The passage of time was a constant theme.</p>
<p>"I definitely came to mark two decades," said Susan Cockerham (College Eight '93, biology) as she sat near the koi. "I told my dad I was coming back to Alumni Weekend. He said, 'What? It's only been five years since you graduated, right?' When I told him it was 20 years, he laughed maniacally!"</p>
<p>Everyone was in a reflective mode, including Chancellor George Blumenthal, who reflected on some of the happiest moments at UCSC while addressing the crowd at the Banana Slug Lunch, held at Porter College.</p>
<p>Among those highlights: the day in 1986 when students made the Banana Slug their official mascot, the first time he successfully biked all the way up UCSC's notorious hill, and, most of all, his chance to accompany astronomy professor Sandy Faber to the White House, where President Obama presented her with the National Medal of Science this February. <a href="https://grb.ucsc.edu/blog/2013/weekend.html">Blumenthal also shared his list of UCSC highlights in a recent blog posting</a>.</p>
<p>After eating lunch, alumni said hello to Kendra Baker (Crown '01, language studies), co-owner of the highly successful locally based Penny Ice Creamery, who was on hand serving up scoops of strawberry pink peppercorn, Tahitian vanilla, and Verve coffee praline ice cream, with chocolate sorbet as a lighter option.</p>
<p>Nothing, not even the inconveniences of geography, could keep those Slugs away from all these good times<strong>.</strong> They came from New York City, Las Vegas, Portland, Houston, Milwaukee, Boston, Bloomington, Chicago, and spots even more far-flung. <strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p>One Slug sojourner, Charlene Paquette Moscovici (College Five [now Porter] '73, aesthetic studies), who went on to be a film actress and model, and worked for many years in the advertising industry, traveled from Paris, France. She said the campus and her years there, as well as her friendship with the late George Hitchcock, the legendary poet, painter, and creative writing lecturer, refined her aesthetic sense and changed the way she looks at the world.</p>
<p>Other far-traveling Slugs did their best to extend the party. Elizabeth Heller (College Eight '03, theater arts), connected with Slugs in her graduating class via Facebook and arranged to rent a house in Santa Cruz during the weekend festivities. Her group of pals&#8212;flying in from as far away as Germany&#8212;made special commemorative T-shirts for the occasion.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5bd09bef807270464f71d691b254bfa2"><name>online-education-coursera-ucsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC panel looks at the future of online education</title><summary>UCSC community members had a chance to air out some of their hopes and concerns about online education at a panel discussion Friday at Stevenson College.</summary><start-date>1367339940000</start-date><display-name>online education at ucsc</display-name><path>/2013/04/online-education-coursera-ucsc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/online-education-coursera-ucsc</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1367339998125</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1367340353455</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Research</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White </name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/coursera 80 thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/coursera 80 thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coursera 80 thumb.jpg</name><display-name>coursera 80 thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17897</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With colleges around the world beginning to embrace online courses, academics and students have debated the merits and potential pitfalls of the new technology.</p>
<p>UCSC community members had a chance to air out some of those hopes and concerns at a panel discussion Friday at Stevenson College focusing on the value of online education at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Moderated by alumna Lois Kazakoff (Cowell '76), deputy editor for the San Francisco Chronicle, the panel discussion was the <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/senate-meetings/senate-forums/2013-april-26-forum.html">third in a series of discusses about online education&#160;offered by UCSC's Academic Senate</a>.</p>
<p>Molecular biology major Matt Hong, a student representative on the panel, described online offerings as a highly efficient way to extend the impact of a traditional, analog class. All too often, traditional classroom offerings are inefficient because they leave no chance for recap and review and because they lock students into rigid schedules, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can create my own schedule of classes, it opens up time for more hands on learning including lab work,&#8221; Hong continued.</p>
<p>Daphne Koller, co-founder of Coursera, and a professor of computer science at Stanford University, said free online education courses are a moral obligation that must be provided to &#8220;have nots who don&#8217;t have equal access to high quality education. We owe them a debt.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also said that &#8216;lifelong learners&#8217; can also benefit from this technology, along with college students who would use the course not as a substitute but as a complement to high-quality classroom instruction.</p>
<p>But other panelists sounded notes of caution about the fact that <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/02/coursera.html">UCSC is now one of 62 university campuses across the world that offers free online courses in partnership with Coursera</a>, a Silicon Valley company that provides a popular platform for MOOCs, an acronym for &#8220;massive open online courses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Education professor Rodney Ogawa said that UCSC must be highly conscious of its reasons for using online course offerings: to provide equitable access, because of pedagogical advantages, as a new source of revenue, &#8220;or is it because all the big dogs are doing it like MIT and Stanford.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Meister, a professor in the History of Consciousness program at UCSC, cautioned UCSC against &#8220;leaping to the assumption&#8221; that online education can fill in the gaps left behind when the state government began to defund public education. He also worried about future access to online education. &#8220;I&#8217;m against any pricing model that could happen if we&#8217;re not careful,&#8221; he said. &#160;</p>
<p>After Meister added that the technology could eliminate jobs for faculty, Koller said that professors had similar concerns when academic textbooks appeared for the first time.</p>
<p>Campus provost Alison Galloway, an anthropology professor at UCSC, said the reason to consider online platforms has less to do with cost savings and more to do with educational quality. Lamenting that she has limited time to work with students examining bones in class, Galloway said providing lectures online could provide more opportunities for "students to do intensive skeletal work with me &#8230; There are so many ways to use online education to enhance what we do.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also said such courses could help students get through difficult classes with a stronger sense of the material than they had if the class were exclusively in-person or exclusively online, potentially helping them pass through those courses, freeing up future seats, and saving them tuition money.</p>

<br/>
The report, "Top Secret America &#8211; 9/11 to the Boston Bombings," airs on the PBS program "Frontline" tonight (April 30). It is an updated version of a program that originally aired in September 2011.<br/>
<br/>
The program is based on "<a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/">Top Secret America</a>,&#8221; published in 2010 by the <em>Post</em>, the result of a two-year investigation Priest and her colleague William M. Arkin made into the enormous ecosystem of military, intelligence, and corporate interests spawned in the decade after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The report won a George Polk Award for National Reporting in 2011. <br/>
<br/>
Priest, twice winner of the Pulitzer Prize, traces the journey from 9/11 to the marathon bombings, examining efforts to improve information sharing among federal agencies tasked with protecting the nation. She also investigates the secret history of the 12-year battle against terrorism.<br/>
<br/>
"Top Secret America" revealed that the business of keeping Americans safe involved at the time 854,000 people with top-secret security clearances working on counter-terrorism and homeland-security issues for 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies in some 10,000 locations across the U.S.<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5cd304ef807270464f71d691ea386191"><name>jfast-retrieval</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scientists retrieve temperature data from Japan Trench observatory</title><summary>Data recovered in an unprecedented series of operations will reveal frictional heat generated by fault slip during the Tohoku earthquake</summary><keywords>JFAST, Emily Brodsky, Patrick Fulton, Tohoku earthquake</keywords><start-date>1367308800000</start-date><display-name>Scientists retrieve temperature data from Japan Trench observatory</display-name><path>/2013/04/jfast-retrieval</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/jfast-retrieval</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1367356933302</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1367358631140</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/fulton-w-loggers-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/fulton-w-loggers-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fulton-w-loggers-375.jpg</name><display-name>fulton-w-loggers-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>124387</file-size><width>375</width><height>493</height></image><image-alt>temperature loggers on deck of ship</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2013/04/images/wellhead-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2013/04/images/wellhead-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wellhead-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>wellhead-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21897</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>observatory well head</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>UCSC researcher Patrick Fulton (blue jacket) and other scientists examine the retrieved instrument string on the deck of the research vessel <em>Kairei</em>.

<p>Emily Brodsky, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, helped organize the Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project (JFAST), which successfully drilled across the Tohoku earthquake fault last year and installed a borehole observatory nearly 7 kilometers beneath the ocean surface. UCSC research scientist Patrick Fulton was on board the research vessel <em>Kairei</em>, operated by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), for the retrieval of the string of pressure and temperature sensors that was installed across the fault zone at about 800 meters beneath the seafloor.</p>
<p>This was the last phase of operations for JFAST, designed to investigate the huge slip (50 meters or more) on the shallow portion of the plate boundary fault that was largely responsible for the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. The data recovered from the sensors provide a very high-precision record of temperature at 55 different depths across the plate boundary. Many of the sensors also recorded water pressure.</p>
<p>"We will be analyzing the data to characterize the amount of frictional heat on the fault during the Tohoku earthquake," Fulton said. "We'll also be closely investigating the effects of other processes within the subsurface, such as groundwater flow and seafloor movement due to aftershocks. It is exciting to finally have this amazing data in hand."</p>
<p>According to Brodsky, the entire project was unprecedented on many levels. "Nobody had done rapid-response drilling in the ocean, nobody had drilled anything substantial under 7 kilometers of water, nobody had placed an observatory in a fault that deep, and nobody had retrieved a string of instruments from that deep," she said.</p>
<p>The scientific drilling vessel <em>Chikyu</em> installed the observatory in a dedicated borehole that penetrated 855 meters below the seafloor in a water depth of 6897.5 meters during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) <a href="http://www.jamstec.go.jp/chikyu/exp343/e/">Expedition 343/343T</a>, April-July 2012. Brodsky said the team was very worried after an earthquake occurred in the area in December, raising the possibility of an undersea landslide that could have buried the wellhead of the observatory. So it was a great relief when the instrument string was successfully recovered on April 26, 2013.</p>
<p>The recovered sensors provide data that will be used to determine the frictional heat generated by fault slip during the Tohoku earthquake. Scientists will infer the forces on the fault during the earthquake from these measurements of dissipated energy. The new data are critical to understanding the causes of the large, shallow displacements during earthquakes that can generate devastating tsunamis. The JFAST observatory provides the first temperature measurements at a subduction plate boundary fault immediately after an earthquake.</p>
<p>Fulton described the recovery operation in an email from aboard the <em>Kairei:</em> "Everyone was overjoyed in the <em>Kaiko</em> ROV control room as we started to faintly see the observatory come into view and the words 'wa suranai 3.11' we had painted on the side of the observatory, which means: 'Never forget 3.11,' the day of the earthquake and tsunami. We then used the ROV robot arms to grab the sensor string and then pull the sensors out of the hole. It was a tense moment and I was extremely uneasy. There was a very strong possibility that the fault may have continued to move, [trapping] our sensor string. It was a few very long seconds until we realized that everything was coming out smoothly and we had probably recovered everything. A few hours later, under a starry night with a lightning storm brewing on the horizon, we had pulled the sensor string onto the boat and confirmed we had all 55 sensors."</p>
<p>Brodsky and Fulton will be busy analyzing the data over the next few weeks in preparation for the Japan Geoscience Union Meeting, May 19 to 24, when they will present some of the initial results.</p>

Thousands of participants are expected fill the Oakes College Lower Lawn from noon to 6 p.m. to bask in the great food and environment.</p>
<p>This year, the festival&#8217;s theme is &#8220;Individual Unique, Together Complete.&#8221; Although the event showcases multiple unique ethnic organizations, together the diversity creates a complete representation of many underrepresented groups on the UCSC campus. Planning the Multicultural Festival this year proved possible with the collaboration of 17 student organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Multicultural Festival is an event that I look forward to every year,&#8221; said Robert Bisquera Jr., a senior at UC Santa Cruz who has worked on planning the event since his freshman year. &#8220;One of the important aspects of this festival, aside from the food and dances, is to break down the barriers among the communities on this campus and work in solidarity with one another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Come see the African Showboyz perform as the headliner act of the show. This group of brothers, from Ghana in West Africa, is taking time out of their U.S. tour to perform at the festival. Along with the African Showboyz, there will be various ethnic student performers and other performers like Son Caribe and Native Boogie Beats performing as well.</p>
<p>The festival&#8217;s food stands offer a tantalizing menu of options from bulgogi tacos (a Korean twist on the traditional taco) to samosas and esquites (flavored toasted corn) &#8212; and many other regional foods from various cultures. Come hungry and bring some money to satisfy your taste for food around the world.</p>
<p>Admission to the festival is free. No alcohol is permitted at this event. The SOAR (Student Organization Advising and Resources) Office wishes to make this event accessible to people with disabilities. If you need accommodations, please contact SOAR at (831) 459-2934.</p>
<p>People interested in attending are encouraged to bring their friends and family &#8212; and become a part of this annual event.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="fcebcb0f8072704645a6591e06010d85"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1325408400000</start-date><path>/2013/04/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2013/04/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1357158009589</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1357158009589</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
