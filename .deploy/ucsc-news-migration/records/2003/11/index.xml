The interviews were conducted by 11 UCSC students who were trained in an oral history internship course, as well as a team of community volunteers. Ten narrative essays by UCSC alumni are also included. </p><p>Out in the Redwoods has been published as a 350-page illustrated paperback, featuring a poetic montage of excerpts from the oral histories, and the full narratives by alumni. Also included is a CD-ROM with full transcripts of the oral histories and other resources. Coordinated and edited by oral historian Irene Reti, the book also includes an introduction, timeline, bibliography, and other reference material.</p><p>Reti noted that the history of UCSC spans the historical timeline from before Stonewall, through the rise of the feminist movement, gay liberation movement, and other leftist student movements of the 1960s and 1970s, the flourishing of women's studies, and the battle against AIDS, to the queer student activism of the past two decades. She added that at this critical crossroads in history, those who witnessed and participated in the birth of a movement of liberation have been able and willing to share their singular historical experiences with the continuing generation of GLBT college students.</p><p>The library has collected a rich archive of historical material that will be the basis of an Out in the Redwoods exhibit on display from January through mid-March 2004. A free public reading/reception for the book will also be held at McHenry Library on Friday, February 6, from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m.</p><p>For more information, contact Irene Reti at the Regional History Project, (831) 459-2847, ihreti@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d3f358072704601a012fff8abde0a"><name>421</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Leading economist named Social Sciences dean at UCSC</title><author>Elizabeth M.

Greenwood announced today (Monday, November 10) that Michael M. Hutchison has been appointed as interim dean of the UC Santa Cruz Social Sciences Division, effective December 1.</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFCC33" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">Professor Michael Hutchison will assume position December 1</font></b></td></tr></table>"Michael Hutchison is an ideal choice for this key post," Greenwood commented. "He is an internationally renowned scholar and a proven leader. The faculty and programs of the Social Sciences Division are widely recognized for exceptional merit, and having Dr. Hutchison as their dean promises even more distinction for the division."</p><p>Hutchison, a UCSC alumnus, is one of the world's leading experts in international finance and the Japanese economy, frequently consulting with central banks around the world. His recent research focuses on financial instability in Japan, the costs of financial crises in developing economies, and the effectiveness of central bank foreign-exchange market intervention.  </p><p> "This is a wonderful opportunity," Hutchison said.  "Since my undergraduate days here, I have held a deep commitment to the excellence that characterizes education at UC Santa Cruz. It will be a genuine privilege to advance the aspirations of my colleagues and to support the education of the next generation of leaders."</p><p>Hutchison joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1985. He is currently a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, a research associate of Economic Policy Research Unit (University of Copenhagen), and a research fellow of the Hamburg Institute of International Economics. </p><p>Coauthor of two recent books on the Japanese financial system: <i>Financial Policy and Central Banking in Japan</i> (MIT Press, 2000) and <i>The Political Economy of Japanese Monetary Policy</i> (MIT Press, 1997), Hutchison also coedited the book <i>Fiscal Aspects of European Monetary Integration</i> (Cambridge University Press, 1999). His recent research has appeared in the <i>Economic Journal; Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking; Journal of International Economics;</i> and <i>Scandinavian Journal of Economics,</i> among other journals. He is an executive editor of the <i>Journal of Asian Economies.</i> </p><p>Michael Hutchison received his Ph.D. in economics (1983) from the University of Oregon and his B.A. in economics (1976) from the University of California, Santa Cruz.  He has worked at the Bank for International Settlements, and had visiting appointments with the Bank of Japan, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Bank of Sweden, and other institutions. He has also taught at the University of Gothenburg, the Copenhagen Business School, the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, and the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California.  </p><p>Hutchison's appointment follows the move of former dean Martin M. Chemers to interim campus provost and executive vice chancellor.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d40898072704601a012ffe42ca40e"><name>422</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Arboretum will hold Wreath Sale on Saturday and Sunday, November 15 and 16</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495, stephens@ucsc.edu; Stephen McCabe (831) 427-2998, smccabe@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1068447600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Arboretum will hold...</display-name><path>/2003/11/422</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/11/422</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338013254</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338013254</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Wonderful holiday decorations and gifts will be available from the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum at the annual Dried Flower and Succulent Wreath Sale on Saturday and Sunday, November 15 and 16.

Rabinowitz, a distinguished emeritus professor of molecular and cell biology at UC Berkeley, as well as an enthusiastic cellist and avid patron of the arts.</p><p>"The Music Department is tremendously grateful for this bequest, which will</p><p>enhance the quality and diversity of our classroom teaching, benefit the innovative research undertaken by members of the music faculty, and support ongoing efforts to establish new graduate degree programs in music at UC Santa Cruz," said Music Department chairman Anatole Leikin.   </p><p>When fully cataloged, the Rabinowitz collection will increase the library's classical CD collection by almost 50 percent, raising it to a very high standard for a university of this size. UC Santa Cruz music librarian Paul Machlis noted that Rabinowitz was a highly knowledgeable collector, buying deeply in genres ranging from early to contemporary music, and including titles from foreign and independent labels in addition to the major classical recording companies. </p><p>"A collection of this size and quality would normally take me many years to build, given current budgetary conditions," Machlis said. "Mr. Rabinowitz's bequest will allow me to focus precious funds for compact discs on other sorely needed areas of music."</p><p>Rabinowitz was first introduced to the UCSC Library by his longtime friend, Edward Penhoet, former dean of the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, cofounder of Chiron Corporation, and now director for science and higher education programs at the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. "He was a true devotee of culture," Penhoet said of Rabinowitz in a recent UC Berkeley publication. "Science, art, music, literature-all interested him. Without a doubt, he was the most complete example of a Renaissance man I've ever known."</p><p>A talented photographer, Rabinowitz also left his extensive and wide-ranging collection of color slides to Special Collections at UC Santa Cruz. The library is planning to make portions of this archive available online. Rabinowitz often exhibited his photographs at galleries in the San Francisco Bay Area and won the Grand Prize in Color award of Saturday Review magazine's 1969 World Travel Photography Contest. </p><p>"These photographs are from Jesse Rabinowitz's world travels," noted Christine Bunting, UCSC's head of Special Collections and Archives. "His work is deeply humanistic in content, capturing intimate scenes of everyday life and the faces of many cultures. We're extremely pleased to have his work represented in Special Collections' photographic collections," Bunting added.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d44138072704601a012ff3a91d9b2"><name>424</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New UC Santa Cruz program sends humanities graduate students into local schools</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1068620400000</start-date><display-name>New UC Santa Cruz...</display-name><path>/2003/11/424</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/11/424</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338014151</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338014151</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Literature graduate student Veronica Kirk-Clausen was a little nervous when she stepped into Martha Dyer's eighth-grade class at Mission Hill Junior High in Santa Cruz last spring. </p><p>"I'm used to teaching undergraduate sections and writing classes with students  ages 18 to 21," Kirk-Clausen recalled. "I didn't know what to expect or how to anticipate their reactions, but they surprised me by being very interested, excited, and asking sophisticated questions."</p><p>Kirk-Clausen's junior high visit was part of the Graduate Student Speaker's Bureau, a new program launched in January by UCSC's Humanities Division. It offers free classroom presentations to high school, junior high, and middle school classrooms in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties. Graduate students are selected to participate on the basis of their particular areas of expertise, as well as their ability to communicate with local students in the community.</p><p>The program was proposed and designed by Christopher Connery, associate professor of literature at UCSC. </p><p>"We wanted to do more humanities outreach through the Institute for Humanities Research," Connery said. "We have great reserves of talent here in the division and wanted to do more to share that with our community."</p><p>Connery added that one of the goals of the program is to introduce middle and high school students to the idea of graduate school and research in the humanities. It is also intended to give graduate students experience in sharing their knowledge with diverse, nonacademic audiences, as well as to strengthen ties between UCSC graduate programs and area teachers. </p><p>The presentations cover a wide range of topics in the fields of English, language arts, history, literature, linguistics, philosophy, and cultural studies. Kirk-Clausen gave a talk on California literature, comparing descriptions of the state's landscape from a Native American creation myth and John Steinbeck's classic novel East of Eden.</p><p>A native of Pacific Grove, Kirk-Clausen earned her bachelor of arts degree in English from UC Davis. Now in her third year of graduate studies at UCSC, she specializes in 19th- and 20th-century American literature with a focus on California, as well as medieval French literature. Although her ultimate goal is to teach at the college level, she found her experience at the junior high to be particularly beneficial for everyone involved.</p><p>"It was good for me to take my ideas off campus and to see how I would have to rework them and reexamine them in order to present them to a completely different audience,"  Kirk-Clausen observed. "And I know the students learned about the subject, but they also learned about what it means to go to college, and what studying the humanities is all about. Choosing a profession like law or medicine is easier to understand for junior high schoolers than becoming a researcher in the humanities," she added. </p><p>Program administrator and Ph.D. candidate in literature Sherri Helvie noted that teacher response to the new program has been overwhelmingly positive. She added that graduate students work closely with teachers in developing the presentations so that they are appropriate for the age groups and student interests.</p><p>"Junior and high school students often don't know that they may pursue a career based upon their interests in history, literature, philosophy, or linguistics,"  Helvie said. "Having access to graduate students who are doing just that opens up a whole field of possibilities to our local students."</p><p>This fall, the Humanities Division has also launched a new program connecting UCSC faculty members with teachers in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties. The Teacher Scholar Program offers a series of seminars on topics in the humanities that will help middle, junior, and high school teachers with curriculum enrichment. Presented in partnership with the Santa Cruz County Office of Education and UCSC Extension, the program allows teachers to explore a variety of subjects in a university setting.</p><p>Seminars scheduled for the future include: "Reimagining 'Western' Civilization: Contact, Commerce and Crusades in the Medieval Mediterranean," with associate professor of world literature and cultural studies Sharon Kinoshita on February 25 and March 3, 2004; and "Jazz Cultures," with associate professor of American studies Eric Porter, on May 10 and May 24, 2004.</p><p>For more information about UCSC's Graduate Student Speaker's Bureau or the Teacher Scholar Program, contact program administrator Sherri Helvie at helvie@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d45378072704601a012ff1a75668c"><name>425</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>$1  million gift to scholarship fund will support women in engineering at UCSC</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1069052400000</start-date><display-name>$1  million gift...</display-name><path>/2003/11/425</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/11/425</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338014466</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338014466</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Women studying engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will be the beneficiaries of a $1 million contribution to the Amy Beth Snader Memorial Scholarship Fund from the estate of Barbara Snader. The scholarship fund was established in 1997 in memory of Barbara Snader's daughter, Amy, a UCSC alumna who died in a hiking accident while on vacation in Hawaii. </p><p>The new contribution dramatically increases the amount of scholarship funds available to support students in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering. The endowed fund will now generate nearly $45,000 annually in direct student support, said Steve Kang, dean of the engineering school.</p><p>"This is a very significant gift, certainly the largest ever made for scholarships to the Baskin School of Engineering," Kang said. </p><p>The Amy Beth Snader Scholarships are awarded to women in engineering on the basis of merit, and Kang noted that the recognition they provide to the recipients can be as important as the financial support. The scholarships will help the school's efforts to increase the number of women pursuing engineering degrees at UCSC, he said. Currently, about 15 percent of undergraduates in the School of Engineering are women, which is on par with the national average.</p><p>"We have a strong interest in supporting women in engineering, and these scholarships will help us recruit and retain the best students," Kang said.</p><p>Amy Snader earned a bachelor's degree in computer science in 1983 and went on to a highly successful career as a software engineer at Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), a computer software company cofounded by UCSC alumnus Doug Michels. Many of the initial contributions to the scholarship fund established in her memory came from Snader's colleagues at SCO. </p><p>"Amy was an exceptional woman who had the vision, confidence, and tenacity to develop her technical talents and pursue a software engineering career in spite of any social biases to the contrary," said Michels, now CEO of Tarantella.</p><p>"She was one of the first female Unix Operating System engineers we were able to recruit, and she quickly dispelled any gender-based stereotypes that anyone may have harbored by performing with a level of skill well beyond what would have been expected of any new grad," he said. "As she grew professionally, Amy provided inspiration and leadership that her former coworkers still recall with admiration today. It's wonderful that the recipients of this scholarship will also have the opportunity to be inspired by her, and in turn, help keep her spirit alive."</p><p>Snader's work at SCO made a lasting impression on many of her colleagues, including Dean Thomas, who was engineering manager at SCO when she was hired. </p><p>"Amy had a commitment to excellence second to none. I can remember a grateful customer giving her a case of champagne for getting them out of a jam, and she was the only one who could have done it," Thomas said. "We miss her still."</p><p>Since its establishment, the Amy Beth Snader Memorial Scholarship Fund has provided significant support for several UCSC students, and it will now be able to benefit many more, said John Idstrom, director of development for the School of Engineering. </p><p>The $1 million contribution is the third largest gift ever made to the UCSC campus for scholarships and the second largest gift to UCSC from an estate. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d46708072704601a012ff0c8be707"><name>426</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Alumni Association announces award winners for 2003-04</title><author>Louise Donahue (831/459-5312)</author><start-date>1069052400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Alumni Association announces...</display-name><path>/2003/11/426</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/11/426</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338014777</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338014777</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association will give its highest honors in 2003-04 to a California assemblyman, an anthropologist, and a campus housing staff member. In ceremonies that will take place on campus in February, John Laird will receive the Alumni Achievement Award; Diane Gifford-Gonzalez, the Distinguished Teaching Award; and Carol Douglas-Hammer, the Outstanding Staff Award.</p>
<p>Laird was elected in 2002 to represent the state's 27th assembly district. Prior to representing a district that includes parts of Santa Cruz, Monterey, and Santa Clara Counties, Laird served two terms on the Santa Cruz City Council, where he was elected to two one-year terms as mayor. He also served as a Cabrillo College trustee for eight years.</p>
<p>"John Laird is an experienced and tested leader," said Fred Keeley, who preceded Laird as assemblyman. "He is passionate and committed to the causes we care about."</p>
<p>Among those causes is the environment, a longtime priority for Laird. He is chair of the assembly's Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee and the Select Committee on California Water Needs and Climate Change. In the 1980s, Laird drew national attention for being one of a handful of openly gay mayors. He has been a strong advocate for gay and lesbian rights and authored a bill signed into law recently that adds "hatred and intolerance prevention" training as a category for which school districts, county offices of education, and eligible charter schools can be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Laird is a familiar voice to public radio listeners in the Santa Cruz area from hosting the weekly Talk of the Bay public affairs program on KUSP Radio for five years before launching his assembly campaign. He was also a regular editorial page columnist for the Santa Cruz Sentinel.</p>
<p>Distinguished Teaching Award winner Diane Gifford-Gonzalez is an anthropological archaeologist who reaches out to students at every level, teaching large introductory courses as well as upper-division topical and theory courses. She also sponsors multiple independent studies each quarter and collaborates with students on paper and poster presentations at national meetings.</p>
<p>"Each of these courses requires very different approaches and skills, and Diane has mastered them all," said colleague Judith Habicht-Mauche, associate professor of anthropology and Department of Anthropology chair. "She is a captivating lecturer who speaks with passion, wit, and empathy." Gifford-Gonzalez received an Excellence in Teaching Award from the Academic Senate in 1999-2000.</p>
<p>Gifford-Gonzalez's research centers on the interrelationship of people and animals. Her work has tracked the movement of different animals as they were introduced into new environments along with the people who herded or tended them. A Fulbright Scholar, she has taught graduate courses at the University of Nairobi in Kenya and intensive workshops on zooarchaeology in Beijing, China.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Gifford-Gonzalez received a three-year grant from the National Science Foundation to continue her research on prehistoric human ecology and environmental impacts in the Monterey Bay region.</p>
<p>Outstanding Staff Award winner Carol Douglas-Hammer deals with more modern human ecology as assistant director for Student Housing Services. Each year, Douglas-Hammer combines her analytical ability, research skills, and even "a touch of clairvoyance"-according to one colleague-to make amazingly accurate forecasts of fall-housing occupancy.</p>
<p>In her more than 20 years at UCSC, Douglas-Hammer's responsibilities have grown steadily as what was once Housing and Dining Services has expanded to include the colleges and child care. Douglas-Hammer has gained a reputation across campus as an effective, results-oriented professional. She has been particularly effective in directing the creation of marketing and informational materials for prospective and current students-and their families-that greatly contribute to important recruitment efforts and maintain successful student relationships. Douglas-Hammer has also encouraged maximum use of online resources, including online registration for housing and other services.</p>
<p>"Nearly every student who has attended within the last two decades, or who will attend UCSC in the future, has been or will be positively affected by her work," said Sue Matthews, director of business and support services for the Colleges and University Housing Services.</p>
<p>Douglas-Hammer is known for going the extra mile and putting students first. "While she is charged with ensuring compliance with the business end of housing, she has always reached beyond this in dealing with students and their families," said Michael McCawley, associate director of admissions. "On many occasions, she has found creative solutions for many incoming undergraduates faced with difficulties, and many of these students come from underrepresented ethnicities and/or low-income families."</p>
<p>A $500 cash award and a framed certificate will be presented to the winners of the Alumni Achievement Award, the Distinguished Teaching Award, and the Outstanding Staff Award at a luncheon on Saturday, February 7, from noon to 2:30 p.m. at the Colleges Nine and Ten Dining Hall Multipurpose Room. Ten College Service Awards and 37 need-based scholarships will also be presented by the UCSC Alumni Association at the luncheon.</p>
<p>Reservations for the luncheon, which costs $18, may be made online at <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/programs/awards/luncheon_2004.html">alumni.ucsc.edu/programs/awards/luncheon_2004.html</a>or by calling (831) 459-2530.</p>

Forced to cut short his studies at UCLA to support his parents during the Great Depression, Walsh returned to the classroom decades later, graduating from UCLA's executive program in 1964, and receiving an M.B.A. from Pepperdine University in 1972.</p><p>Now, Walsh's son and daughter-in-law are doing their part to ensure that future students won't have to abandon college. UCSC economics professor Carl Walsh and his wife, Judy, have established the Walsh Family Scholarship Endowment for Social Science majors in honor of Eugene and Bessie Walsh.</p><p>In recognition of the gift, the conference room in Social Sciences 1 has been renamed the Eugene and Bessie Walsh Conference Room. A plaque inside the room will describe the careers and philanthropy of Eugene and Bessie Walsh.</p><p>"This is a lasting way of honoring my parents," said Carl Walsh. "They set a good example of doing things they thought would make the world a better place."</p><p>Judy Walsh is a member of the pioneer class of Crown College, earning a bachelor's degree in history in 1971. In 1990 she received a master's degree in applied economics. Judy is now the development officer for UCSC's New Teacher Center, and has worked for UCSC in other capacities.</p><p>"We feel especially happy and grateful that this wonderful gift is from one of our most renowned faculty members and one of our staff members who is also a UCSC alumna," said Social Sciences Dean Martin M. Chemers. "Both Carl and Judy Walsh have been contributing to the success of UC Santa Cruz in their respective capacities for many years. Their establishment of this scholarship endowment, and their naming of this conference room in honor of Carl Walsh's parents, is a heartening and very generous expression of support for the campus's educational endeavors."</p><p>Carl Walsh joined the faculty in 1987 after being affiliated with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, where he continues to be a visiting scholar. He was previously on the faculty at Princeton and ar the University of Auckland in New Zealand. His research focuses on issues in monetary economics, including the effects of institutional reforms on monetary policy.</p><p>Eugene Walsh retired in 1977 as president and CEO of Ralph's Grocery Company and vice president and assistant to the chairman of Ralph's parent company, Federated Department Stores. Eugene and Bessie Walsh are active in the Food Industry Circle of the City of Hope charity in Los Angeles which has raised more than $100 million for cancer research, and Eugene Walsh has received numerous awards for his civic work in the Los Angeles area. The elder Walshes have also donated to research activities in UCSC's Economics Department for years. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d4a568072704601a012ff4f90befa"><name>429</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Professor of ocean sciences Kenneth Bruland appointed to the Ida Benson Lynn Endowed Chair in Ocean Health at UCSC</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1069657200000</start-date><display-name>Professor of ocean sciences...</display-name><path>/2003/11/429</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/11/429</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338015774</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338015774</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Kenneth Bruland, professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has spent more than 25 years studying the chemistry of the ocean and the ways in which trace amounts of certain elements influence marine ecosystems. Bruland was a pioneer in the development of the demanding techniques needed to measure trace elements in seawater. His appointment this month to the Ida Benson Lynn Endowed Chair in Ocean Health recognizes Bruland's important contributions in this area and provides support for his ongoing research. </p><p> </p><p>The Ida Benson Lynn Endowed Chair in Ocean Health was established in 1998 and is intended for an outstanding scholar with research interests in the area of ocean health. Bruland's five-year appointment to the chair brings with it $15,000 per year to support his teaching, public service, and research, and an additional $40,000 to support graduate student fellowships. </p><p> </p><p>Bruland said he has several ideas for using the funds that come with the endowed chair.</p><p> </p><p>"I am especially excited about the idea of being able to use this endowment to help recruit and support outstanding graduate students," he said. </p><p> </p><p>With fellowship support from the endowment, rather than being funded under a specific research grant, the graduate students will have more flexibility to collaborate with other faculty and to undertake interdisciplinary projects, Bruland said. </p><p> </p><p>"I work with other marine science faculty who are more biologically oriented, while I provide the expertise in ocean chemistry, and I'd like to see students working in areas that bridge those different disciplines," he said. </p><p> </p><p>Bruland said he would use some of the funds from the endowment to make his research accessible to a wider audience through articles, lectures, and web sites. He also has plans to develop a display on his research for the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, the public education center at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory.  </p><p> </p><p>Much of Bruland's current research focuses on the chemical factors that allow extensive blooms of single-celled algae, or phytoplankton, to occur in coastal waters. Periodic algal blooms provide the food that ultimately supports productive fisheries and abundant marine life in places like Monterey Bay. Major nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are key factors in stimulating algal blooms, but trace elements such as iron and zinc also play an important role as micronutrients, Bruland said. In many parts of the ocean, for example, the availability of iron is the limiting factor that determines the abundance of phytoplankton. </p><p> </p><p>By converting sunlight into food energy, phytoplankton provide most of the "primary production" at the base of the marine food chain. In that sense, they are the foundation on which healthy marine ecosystems are built. But there is a dark side to phytoplankton, too--they sometimes produce harmful toxins such as domoic acid. Harmful algal blooms can poison marine birds and mammals, and can even pose a health threat to humans. Bruland's research suggests that trace metals such as iron and copper may play a role in the production of algal toxins. </p><p> </p><p>"In most cases, the algal blooms are good things that help make this region so productive. But sometimes the organisms are harmful, so we're trying to understand what factors trigger the toxin production," he said.</p><p> </p><p>Some trace metals themselves can be toxic to phytoplankton if present in high concentrations. Copper, for example, is a potentially toxic trace metal that is a significant contaminant in some coastal environments, including San Francisco Bay. But the toxicity of copper depends on its chemical form, Bruland said. He and his students have found that copper in San Francisco Bay is primarily bound to organic compounds in a nontoxic form. They are currently studying the sources and characteristics of these copper-binding organic compounds. </p><p> </p><p>There may be a connection between the toxicity of trace metals such as copper and the production of toxic compounds by certain algae. Bruland's group has found that the algal toxin domoic acid, which causes amnesic shellfish poisoning in humans, binds both iron and copper in ways that affect their biological availability--detoxifying the copper and making iron, an essential micronutrient, more available. This suggests a physiological role for domoic acid in the species of algae that produce it.</p><p> </p><p>"The production of domoic acid may be triggered when a bloom of this species is stressed by either copper toxicity or iron limitation," Bruland said. </p><p> </p><p>Bruland's research includes investigations of how trace metals influence the growth of phytoplankton in a wide range of ocean environments. During the summer of 2003, he was chief scientist on a major research expedition to the Bering Sea to investigate the influence of trace metals on phytoplankton productivity in the Bering Sea ecosystem. He is currently involved in a large multidisciplinary effort to study the influence of the vast plume of nutrient-rich water that pours out of the mouth of the Columbia River and mixes into the coastal waters off Oregon and Washington. </p><p> </p><p>Research cruises to study the Columbia River plume are planned for the next three summers, and Bruland plans to develop a web site where he and his coworkers can post reports from the field during the cruises. </p><p> </p><p>"Most of my research gets published in specialized journals, and I'd like to reach out to more general audiences and spread the word about what we're doing. A web site is one way for us to do that," Bruland said.</p><p> </p><p>Bruland is the second faculty member to hold the Ida Benson Lynn Endowed Chair in Ocean Health, succeeding Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, who held the first appointment to the chair. </p><p> </p><p>Bruland received his B.A. in chemistry from Western Washington University and his Ph.D. in oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. He came to UCSC in 1974 as an assistant professor of marine studies and is currently chair of the Department of Ocean Sciences. He received the Outstanding Faculty Award for 2001-02 from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences in recognition of his distinguished research career, excellence in teaching, and commitment to service. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Bruland at (831) 459-4587 or bruland@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a280c6b98072704601a012ff8ca85749"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2003/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/11/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626602640</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626602640</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a280c6b98072704601a012ff8ca85749"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2003/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/11/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626602640</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626602640</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
