<p>The Early History of UC Santa Cruz's Farm and Garden takes a detailed look at the emergence of the organic gardening and farming movement in Santa Cruz, while two additional publications examine the social history of commercial agriculture in Watsonville through the eyes of two Mexican American farm laborers.</p>
<p>The UCSC Farm &amp; Garden story is told through recollections of master gardener Alan Chadwick, the visionary founder of the program, who inspired a generation of students to discover the interrelationships between land, climate, and plants. The original Farm &amp; Garden site was established in 1967 on a neglected four-acre plot at Merrill College. Chadwick, with the assistance of his student apprentices, soon transformed the land into a spectacular terraced garden.</p>
<p>In the process, Chadwick taught his students about French intensive horticultural techniques, including the double-digging of garden beds, the use of compost for soil enrichment, and the elimination of all pesticides. This early campus project has since evolved into the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, a renowned and well respected academic program.</p>
<p>The new publication consists of interviews conducted by Maya Hagege, a former Farm &amp; Garden apprentice and UCSC alumna. She spoke with several notable figures involved in the early years of the Garden including Paul Lee, who helped Chadwick found the Garden, and went on to establish the Chadwick Archive at Green Gulch Farm in Marin County. Phyllis Norris also tells of her experiences as an instrumental member of the Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden and recalls the development of the apprenticeship program.</p>
<p>Orin Martin, a former apprentice who became manager of the student garden in 1977, describes changes in the landscape and the wide variety of crops and fruit trees that have been cultivated over the years. And Dennis Tamura, a Chadwick apprentice and the coordinator of the apprentice program from 1978 to 1985, provides a detailed account of Chadwick's unconventional teaching methods and their role in the evolution of the Farm &amp; Garden.</p>
<p>Mike de la Cruz: The Life of a Laboring Man, 1905-1977 documents the life of a Mexican American field-worker who left his home in Arizona at age 13. A self-described drifter and hobo in the 1920s and 1930s, he would hitch, ride freight trains, and travel the country looking for work. Arriving in Watsonville in 1921, he found employment in the fields, harvesting lettuce and beets for a contractor and living in labor camps.</p>
<p>Meri Knaster, a former editor at the library's Regional History Project, interviewed de la Cruz, whose story focuses on a particular American lifestyle that is seldom acknowledged. She documents how he worked the crops in Santa Cruz County during the Depression at a rate of 12 cents per hour, leaving Watsonville between seasons to find work wherever he could--breaking horses, planting tobacco, and even coal mining in West Virginia.</p>
<p>The story of another Watsonville resident is portrayed in Grace Palacio Arcenaux: Mexican American Farmworker and Community Organizer, 1920-1977. Born in Jalisco, Mexico, Arcenaux moved with her family to San Juan Bautista in 1923. When both of her parents died, Arcenaux was left to care for her nine brothers and sisters. She proceeded to hire the family out as a unit, working together in the fields of Watsonville until she contracted tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Arcenaux's narrative depicts the life of farmworkers, the harvesting of crops, and the role of labor contractors in local agriculture. Married at one time to a Filipino farmworker, she describes the local history of the Mexican and Filipino communities, as well as the interrelationships between these two ethnic groups. Her recollections of gambling, prostitution, and Chinatown in Watsonville are full of detail, and her story illuminates issues of gender, ethnicity, and the harsh realities of the local agricultural economy. From illegal immigrant farmworker to middle-class social activist, Arcenaux's life reveals a slice of local social history, framed with eloquence and perspective.</p>
<p>Designed to be a primary source of local history, these three new books have been published in an archival format, and were edited by Randall Jarrell, director of the Regional History Project. For ordering information, contact Jarrell at (831) 459-2847 or rjarrell@ucsc.edu.</p>

The UCSC Deep Store project has been awarded a $205,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, and has received significant gift support from the research divisions of Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft.</p><p>Managing the rapidly increasing volume of digital reference data is a growing problem for companies and institutions, said Darrell Long, professor of computer science and lead investigator on the Deep Store project. </p><p>"We're looking at the problem of managing data that doesn't go away--things like medical records, financial records, and other kinds of documents that, in many cases, companies need to keep for regulatory reasons," Long said. </p><p>These kinds of data are known as fixed content: documents, e-mail, images, and audiovisual data that are kept as a reference for future use. While the volume of such data has been increasing dramatically, users are also beginning to demand quick and easy access to their stored data, said Lawrence You, a graduate student working with Long on the Deep Store project. </p><p>The traditional media for archival storage--magnetic tape and optical disks--do not allow fast online access to stored data. Hard disk drives offer high speed and random access to data, and they are already used in various nonarchival storage systems, such as "storage area networks" and "network-attached storage." Disk-based online storage systems are also available for managing and archiving fixed content (e.g., the Centera system from EMC Corp.), but this is still an expensive option compared to tape-based storage, You said. </p><p>"Currently, most archival storage uses magnetic tape. We want to create a disk-based storage system that can replace the traditional archival medium of tape," You said. </p><p>"The main drawback of tape-based storage is slow access, and in addition tape only lasts five to 15 years," he said. "With disks you can run reliability tests in the background, whereas with a tape you don't know if it's still good until you try to read the data on it."</p><p>The cost advantage of magnetic tape as a storage medium has been greatly diminished in recent years due to rapidly falling prices for hard disk drives. By using high rates of data compression to increase storage density, You and Long think their deep store system can be both faster and cheaper than tape-based systems.</p><p>A lot of fixed-content data exists in multiple versions that contain similar information, such as credit card data in which all the records for a given account contain the same account information. Long has done pioneering work on a technique called delta compression (also called differential compression) that takes advantage of this redundancy. If a file to be stored is similar to one that has already been stored, delta compression encodes the second file as edits of the first file, which can yield tremendous space savings. </p><p>The challenge is designing a software program that can locate similar files within a huge volume of stored data.</p><p>"That's going to be the hard part," said You. "I have this little file that I want to store, and I have to find something that looks like it in this huge amount of stored data. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack, except that I want to find another needle that looks a bit like the one I've got."</p><p>Organizing the data in the deep store so that similar files are associated for efficient storage and retrieval is the current focus of You's work. The process will involve extracting summary data from new files as they are stored, so that searches can be done by comparing summaries rather than searching file by file, You said. </p><p>Another important consideration is to create a scalable architecture for the deep store system, so that the storage capacity will be virtually unlimited. Large companies and institutions will soon require systems capable of storing petabytes of fixed-content data (a petabyte is roughly one million gigabytes).</p><p>The increasing use of digital images and audiovisual files is one factor behind the increasing volume of fixed-content data. Medical imaging, for example, generates huge image files. </p><p>Regulatory changes are also having a tremendous impact, Long said. The heavily regulated health care, finance, and defense industries, for example, are among the biggest consumers of computer storage systems, as companies seek to comply with new regulations for retention of electronic records. Scientific research is another area in which extremely large data sets are being generated, especially in fields such as astronomy and high-energy physics.</p><p>"Online deep stores are a solution to these growing data storage needs," You said.</p><p>Industry support for the Deep Store project includes $35,000 from Microsoft Research and $45,000 from HP Labs. An additional $55,000 in equipment from HP Labs will be used to build a 16-processor cluster machine with 2.5 terabytes of storage space, Long said. The funding and equipment from HP Labs was provided through UCSC's partnership in the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS).</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Long at (831) 459-2616 or darrell@cse.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cf8b98072704601a012ffc18c2575"><name>365</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz revokes fraternity's 'recognition' over fish incident</title><author>Jim Burns: (831/459-2495), jrburns@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1055487600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz revokes...</display-name><path>/2003/06/365</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/06/365</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337994890</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337994890</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz announced today that it has "revoked recognition" of the Delta Omega Chi fraternity over an incident last month that resulted in the death of a campus koi fish. The revocation, which is permanent, means that the campus has severed all ties to the fraternity. Without UCSC affiliation, the fraternity will no longer have access to campus services or facilities.</p><p>"Our investigation into this matter has resulted in a finding of responsibility for Delta Omega Chi fraternity," said Doug Zuidema, director of UCSC's Student Judicial Affairs Office. "We have revoked recognition of the fraternity based on our conclusion that members of the organization were involved in the removal of the fish from the pond and its death."</p><p>	UCSC police investigated the matter after a rare mature Hikari Ogon Japanese Koi disappeared on the evening of May 20 from a pond at Porter College, one of the campus's ten residential colleges.

<p>The results are described in the June 19 issue of Nature, in an article coauthored by Stan Woosley, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>The telling March 29 burst in the constellation Leo, one of the brightest and closest on record, reveals for the first time that a gamma-ray burst and a supernova--the two most energetic explosions known in the universe--occur essentially simultaneously, a quick and powerful one-two punch.</p>

<p>The burst was detected by NASA's High-Energy Transient Explorer (HETE) and observed in detail with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the Paranal Observatory in Chile.</p>

<p>"The March 29 burst changes everything," said Woosley. "With this missing link established, we know for certain that at least some gamma-ray bursts are produced when black holes, or perhaps very unusual neutron stars, are born inside massive stars. We can apply this knowledge to other burst observations." The research team said that just as the Rosetta stone helped us understand an ancient language, this burst will serve as a tool to decode other gamma-ray bursts.</p>

<p>Woosley and his graduate student, Weiqun Zhang, created computer simulations of a gamma-ray burst using one of the fastest unclassified computers in the world, at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Using 128 computer processors simultaneously, Woosley said the simulations took about two weeks--or about 25,000 processor hours. Woosley is director of the Center for Supernova Research, funded by the Department of Energy's Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program. The other partner institutions are the University of Arizona and the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.</p>

<p>A supernova is the explosion of a star at least eight times as massive as the Sun. When such stars deplete their nuclear fuel, they no longer have the energy to support their mass. Their cores implode, forming either a neutron star or (if there is enough mass) a black hole. The surface layers of the star blast outward, becoming a billion times as luminous as the Sun.</p>

<p>Scientists have suspected gamma-ray bursts and supernovae were related, but they have had little observational evidence, until March 29.</p>

<p>"We've been waiting for this one for a long, long time," said Jens Hjorth, University of Copenhagen, lead author of the Nature article, one of three related "letters" appearing in the issue. "The March 29 burst contains all the missing information. It was created through the core collapse of a massive star."</p>
<p>The research team said that the Rosetta stone burst also provides a lower limit on how energetic gamma-ray bursts truly are and rules out most theories concerning the origin of "long bursts," lasting longer than two seconds.</p>

<p>Gamma-ray bursts temporarily outshine the entire universe in gamma-ray light, packing the energy of over 100 million billion suns.</p>
<p>"It is as bright as if two thousand Earth masses were abruptly turned to energy in the form of gamma rays," said Woosley. "Any life within the path of the burst inside of several hundred light-years would have been obliterated."</p>
<p>Yet these explosions are fleeting--lasting only seconds to minutes--and occur randomly from all directions on the sky, making them difficult to study.</p>
<p>GRB 030329, named after its detection date, occurred relatively close, approximately 2 billion light years away (at redshift 0.1685). The burst lasted over 30 seconds. ("Short bursts" are less than 2 seconds long.) GRB 030329 is among the 0.2 percent brightest bursts ever recorded. Its afterglow lingered for weeks in lower-energy X-ray and visible light.</p>
<p>With the VLT, Hjorth and his colleagues uncovered evidence in the afterglow of a massive, rapidly expanding supernova shell, called a hypernova, at the same position and created at the same time as the afterglow. The following scenario emerged:</p>
<p>Thousands of years prior to this explosion, a very massive star, running out of fuel, let loose much of its outer envelope, transforming itself into a bluish Wolf-Rayet star. The Wolf-Rayet star--containing about 10 solar masses worth of helium, oxygen, and heavier elements--rapidly depleted its fuel, triggering the Type Ic supernova/gamma-ray burst event. The core collapsed, without the star's outer part knowing. A black hole formed inside surrounded by a disk of accreting matter, and, within a few seconds, launched a jet of matter away from the black hole that ultimately made the gamma-ray burst.</p>
<p>The jet passed through the outer shell of the star and, in conjunction with vigorous winds of newly forged radioactive nickel-56 blowing off the disk inside, shattered the star. This shattering represents the supernova event.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, collisions among pieces of the jet moving at different velocities, all very close to light speed, created the gamma-ray burst. This "collapsar" model, introduced by Woosley in 1993, best explains the observation of GRB 030329, as opposed to the "supranova" and "merging neutron star" models.</p>
<p>In previous gamma-ray bursts, scientists had found evidence of iron in the afterglow light, a signature of a star explosion. Also, the location of a supernova occurring in 1998, named SN1998bw, appeared to be in the same vicinity as a gamma-ray burst. The data was inconclusive, however, and many scientists remained skeptical of the association.</p>
<p>"Supernova 1998bw whetted our appetite," said coauthor, Chryssa Kouveliotou of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. "But it took five more years before we could confidently say we found the smoking gun that nailed the association between gamma-ray bursts and supernovae."</p>
<p>"This does not mean that the gamma-ray burst mystery is solved," Woosley said. "We are confident that long bursts involve a core collapse, probably creating a black hole. We have convinced most skeptics. We cannot reach any conclusion yet, however, on what causes short gamma-ray bursts."</p>
<p>Short bursts might be caused by neutron star mergers. A NASA-led international satellite named Swift, to be launched in January 2004, will "swiftly" locate gamma-ray bursts and may capture short-burst afterglows, which have yet to be detected.</p>
<p>The VLT is the world's most advanced optical telescope, comprising four 8.2-meter reflecting Unit Telescopes and, in the future, four moving 1.8-meter Auxiliary Telescopes for interferometry. HETE was built by MIT as a mission of opportunity under the NASA Explorer Program, with collaboration among U.S. universities, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and scientists and organizations in Brazil, France, India, Italy, and Japan.</p>

<p>Most examples of cooperative behavior in animals involve cooperation between genetically related individuals, which is explained by the theory of "kin selection." Now, researchers have described an example of cooperation between genetically similar but unrelated members of a lizard species common in the western United States. Their findings, published in the June 20 issue of the journal Science, shed new light on the evolution of cooperation and social behavior.</p>
<p>Barry Sinervo, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been studying the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana) since 1989. He recently teamed up with French ecologist Jean Clobert to analyze ten years worth of data from Sinervo's ongoing field studies. The two scientists are coauthors of the new paper in Science.</p>
<p>"At first, I thought we were seeing kin selection, so it was astounding to find that the lizards that were cooperating were not related," Sinervo said. "There are many examples of kin selection, but we've found some really nonstandard things happening in this species."</p>
<p>The side-blotched lizard has three different color morphs (a "morph" is a morphologically distinct subset of a species). The orange, yellow, and blue color morphs differ not only in their throat color, but also in their behavior. Orange males are very aggressive and mate with lots of females by taking over the territories of other males--Sinervo calls them "usurpers." Yellow males are "sneakers" who don't defend territories but mimic females and sneak behind the backs of territorial males to cuckold them. And blue males are mate guarders, keeping a close eye on their mates; they recognize and chase off yellow sneakers, but lose out in confrontations with orange usurpers.</p>
<p>In previous papers, Sinervo has described these strategies as a kind of "rock-paper-scissors" game, where orange defeats blue, blue defeats yellow, and yellow defeats orange. The result is an evolutionarily stable situation in which no single color morph can dominate the population.</p>
<p>In the new study, Sinervo and Clobert found that blue males tend to establish territories in close proximity to other blue males. Furthermore, DNA analysis showed that neighboring blue males are more similar genetically than would be expected by chance. Yet Sinervo's long-term data on the pedigrees of lizards in the study area showed that the genetically similar blue neighbors are not kin.</p>
<p>"They are so similar they might as well be kin, but we can track the pedigrees back and show that in no case are they brothers or cousins or father-son pairs," Sinervo said.</p>
<p>Once they've set up neighboring territories, the genetically similar blue males apparently work together to guard their mates. The result is an average "fitness" level (measured in terms of the number of offspring they produce) three times higher than that of blue males without such neighbors. Orange males, in contrast, suffer a decrease in fitness if they have a genetically similar neighbor, and they tend to avoid settling near other orange males.</p>
<p>"Orange males are so aggressive, if they end up next to a genetically similar male they just annihilate each other in terms of fitness," Sinervo said.</p>
<p>Throat color in the side-blotched lizard is controlled by genes at a single "locus" or position on a chromosome. The chromosomes come in pairs, and the particular combination of two "alleles" or versions of the throat-color gene determines an individual's color pattern.</p>
<p>The remarkable thing about the color morphs of side-blotched lizards is that an enormous range of behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits are correlated with throat color. Genes for different traits can be linked physically if they occur close together on a chromosome, but according to Sinervo, throat color is linked to far more traits than could possibly be physically linked on the same chromosome.</p>
<p>"It's almost as if the whole genome is tightly tethered to this one master locus," he said. "In order to be a really 'good' blue, you have to have all these other alleles [of different genes] lined up in the right combination, and the same is true for orange and yellow color morphs. So there is strong selection for these different fitness combinations."</p>
<p>The male color morphs show differences not only in the way they interact with other males, but also in how they disperse from their birthplace and choose a territory to settle in, as well as in their hormone levels, immune systems, and other physiological traits. In females, throat color is linked to a different set of traits, which Sinervo has also described in previous papers.</p>
<p>"The whole genome crystallizes into three types," Sinervo said. "The alleles for all these different traits should be independent and separated on the chromosomes, yet the genes are interacting through this one locus."</p>
<p>The selection pressures that favor color morphs with distinctive sets of traits arise from the social system and behavioral interactions between individuals, he said.</p>
<p>"A lot of animals probably have that type of social selection going on. The lizards are really good for elucidating it because it is so conspicuous in them," Sinervo said.</p>
<p>This phenomenon of runaway social selection centered on the throat-color locus has led to the evolution of cooperation in the blue males, Sinervo said. This represents a new idea for how social cooperation evolves, which he and Clobert call "morphotypic" selection, as opposed to kin selection.</p>
<p>"Other researchers have interpreted genetic similarity as indicating a kin relationship, whereas we were able to show that they are genetically similar but not kin," Sinervo said.</p>
<p>This morphotypic level of selection may be a precursor to true kin selection, he added. The distinctive color morphs may also be a step toward the evolution of distinct species.</p>
<p>"We think we're hot on the trail of speciation," Sinervo said. "It's like they're trying to speciate, but they can't because the males screw it up."</p>
<p>In the "rock-paper-scissors" competition for mates, males force themselves on females who might otherwise choose a different mate on the basis of genetic compatibility. The best combinations might be male-female pairs of the same color morph, but the usurpers and sneakers scramble up those nice combinations, Sinervo said.</p>
<p>"These combinations build up again in the next generation, only to be partly scrambled by another round of rock-paper-scissors dynamics," he said.</p>
<p>The cooperative blue males are much more monogamous than the orange usurpers and yellow sneakers, Sinervo noted.</p>
<p>"They're the sensitive male lizards of the new millennium," he quipped.</p>

Providing the played piano part of the vocal score, it allows the singer to practice his part at any time of the day and in any location--without live accompaniment. The tempo for each opera is additionally matched to historic recordings by famous conductors. </p><p>Acquisition of Opera Practice Perfect was initiated by lecturer/voice instructor Brian Staufenbiel, director of UCSC's opera program. He had used selected discs with his students to prepare for performances of Donizetti's Elixir of Love two years ago for UCSC's annual spring opera production.</p><p>	"I think it makes it easier for them to prepare," Staufenbiel noted. "It can't replace coaches because you lose the live interaction between the accompanist and the student. But what it does do is allow the student to practice with accompaniment as much as they need to gain a solid understanding of their part. It helps them to practice more efficiently.</p><p>	"My students were certainly happy to have had a copy of their entire role and to be able to practice any time they wanted," he added. "I'm very happy that we have it."</p><p>	McHenry Library bibliographer Paul Machlis said the collection--worth more than $8,000--was made available to UCSC at less than half its retail price by Opera Practice Perfect founders Cary and Carole Fisher. Substantial donations by an anonymous donor, Razia Nathani-Suleman, and the Friends of the UCSC Library combined to help make the gift possible.</p><p>	"The Music Department is one of the strongest supporters of the library,"  Machlis noted. "Musicians depend upon a strong score and recordings collection that only an academic library can provide. So it's a particular pleasure for the library to be able to support the department with the acquisition of this teaching resource."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cfdda8072704601a012ffe1508062"><name>369</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book by UCSC lecturer reveals qualities shared by world's most successful musicians</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1056351600000</start-date><display-name>New book by UCSC...</display-name><path>/2003/06/369</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/06/369</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337996199</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337996199</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>What makes the great musicians great?

"Anxiety is either in the past, worrying about what was just played, or in the future, worrying about what you are about to play. Nothing can be done about either! Don't judge or evaluate while you're performing."</p><p>Jazz pianist Fred Hersch has a similar take on the issues of creativity and spontaneity, revealing to Green that he often lets his hands wander on the keyboards during practice sessions, yielding completely to his subconscious.</p><p>"I don't think," Hersch observes. "Thinking is the enemy.Picasso said that if you want to create art, you have to make a mess. You have to take the time to experiment. You can't get sidetracked by perfection issues if you want to be a great artist. You have to take chances-and a certain percentage of them are not going to bake."</p><p>A former principal bassist of the Cincinnati Symphony, Green now teaches double bass at UC Santa Cruz, and for the Young Bassist program of the San Francisco Symphony Education Department. Author of The Inner Game of Music with W. Timothy Gallwey, Green has written numerous workbooks for keyboard, voice, instruments, and ensembles. He additionally gives concerts, conducts bass workshops, and presents seminars throughout the country.</p><p>"What's the quality or talent or skill that makes an Itzhak Perlman out of an already fine and talented musician?" Green concludes. "I believe the magic is something that we can learn from watching the great musicians, and asking ourselves about their defining characteristics. And I believe the distance between "good" and "great" that the Itzhak Perlmans of this world have traveled is a distance we all can travel, because it's the distance between being us and being ever more fully ourselves. It is what's inside you-whether you're in music or the fire service, business or education-that makes you unique, special, or even great."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a28007378072704601a012ffa957ffdc"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2003/06/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/06/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626553591</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626553591</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a28007378072704601a012ffa957ffdc"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2003/06/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/06/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626553591</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626553591</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
