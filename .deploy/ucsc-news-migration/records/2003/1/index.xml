The new findings are being presented on Monday, January 6, by astronomers Puragra (Raja) GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and David Reitzel of UCLA at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle.</p>

<p>Andromeda (also known as M31) is the nearest large galaxy to our own Milky Way and is very similar to it in appearance. Studying Andromeda gives astronomers an external perspective on a galaxy much like our own--it's like looking at a bigger sibling of our galaxy, said GuhaThakurta, an associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC. How such galaxies formed is a central question for astronomers, he said.</p>
<p>In spiral galaxies like Andromeda and the Milky Way, most of the prominent young stars lie in a flat disk with spiral arms. In addition, a spherical halo of scattered stars surrounds the disk. Last year, a team of European astronomers reported a giant stream of stars threading through the halo of Andromeda. It is thought to be a vast trail of debris left over from an ancient merger of Andromeda with a smaller galaxy.</p>
<p>The debris stream now being reported by GuhaThakurta and Reitzel is well separated from the one reported last year. It is also much fainter and was detected using a more sensitive technique. The researchers focused on a narrow section of Andromeda's halo, and the fact that they found a debris stream there suggests that there may be many more faint streams in other parts of the galaxy, GuhaThakurta said.</p>
<p>"We looked in just one narrow area of the halo and found a debris stream, which tells us there are probably many more lurking under the surface. Our ability to detect such a faint stream also means that our technique is very sensitive," he said.</p>
<p>The European team, led by Rodrigo Ibata of the Strasbourg Observatory in France, mapped the density of stars in Andromeda's halo, and the resulting image revealed a prominent debris stream. This image shows no trace, however, of the fainter stream found by GuhaThakurta and Reitzel.</p>
<p>"We found another stream in a different part of the galaxy, but it is much more subtle," Reitzel said. "Only about 10 percent of the stars in that part of the sky belong to the stream."</p>
<p>GuhaThakurta and Reitzel used the powerful LRIS and DEIMOS spectrographs on the giant Keck Telescopes in Hawaii to study stars in four fields along a line from the center of the galaxy out through the halo. Spectrographs separate the light from a star into a spectrum of different colors or wavelengths. Astronomers can derive information about a star's motion and chemical composition from its spectrum.</p>
<p>GuhaThakurta and Reitzel discovered a coherent group of chemically rich stars all traveling with the same velocity, which stood out against a background of stars with a broad range of chemical compositions and velocities.</p>
<p>Chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, which astronomers refer to as "metals," are synthesized in very massive stars, which then enrich future generations of stars in these heavier elements. The stars in Andromeda's halo cover a broad range of chemical enrichment properties, and their motions relative to one another are generally random. So the researchers were surprised to find that the most metal-rich stars in their sample all seem to be moving together as a group.</p>
<p>"We think we are seeing the debris trail of a small, chemically rich galaxy that fell into Andromeda," GuhaThakurta said. "Even as this galaxy was disrupted by Andromeda, its stars would retain a memory of their original velocity and continue to move as a coherent group."</p>
<p>Over time, debris streams mix together with the rest of the galaxy and become less prominent. Using the spectroscopic technique, which is sensitive enough to detect a very subtle debris stream, astronomers can find evidence of events that took place far back in time, GuhaThakurta said. But it is hard to tell whether a debris stream is faint because it is old or because the galaxy it came from was small, he noted.</p>
<p>The researchers are continuing their survey of stars in Andromeda's halo, aiming to observe around 10,000 stars. They are beginning to collaborate with Ibata's group on the survey. Eventually, their findings may enable the researchers to piece together a detailed history of how the Andromeda galaxy was assembled.</p>
<p>"These debris streams tell us something about how the galaxy was assembled, but before we can really start to describe the assembly process, we need to survey the whole galaxy in this mode and do a statistical analysis of the debris streams," GuhaThakurta said.</p>
<p>GuhaThakurta is currently a Herzberg Fellow at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Victoria, British Columbia. Reitzel, who earned his Ph.D. with GuhaThakurta at UCSC, is now a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UCLA.</p>

Unlike the ubiquitous forces of the multibillion-dollar development industry--construction and attendant industries like finance, insurance, and real estate--land preservation at the local level takes place in a piecemeal, incremental way that has not been documented until now. The new book <em>Saving Open Space: The Politics of Local Preservation in California</em> (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2002) provides the first-ever statewide analysis of the patterns of open-space acquisition efforts in California. <br/>
<br/>
<p>"The growth machine in California is unequalled in the world, so this is really a story of David versus Goliath," said author Daniel Press, associate professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "The resources that are available for preservation are dwarfed by what's available to developers."</p>
<p>The pace and cost of development are evident. Since 1964, California has lost more than 8 million acres of farmland to development. The state's population jumped from 20 million in 1970 to 32 million in 1995, and the number of automobile miles traveled more than doubled during that period. In 1980, 28 of 58 counties failed to meet federal ozone standards for air quality; in the late 1990s, 40 counties were unable to meet ozone regulations.</p>
<p>In <em>Saving Open Space,</em> Press unveils the alliances of city and county politicians, small-time environmental activists, local parks officials, and nongovernmental organizations like land trusts that have banded together in the absence of state or federal leadership to rein in urban sprawl, provide watershed and habitat protection, set aside recreation areas, and protect productive farmland.</p>
<p>"National organizations like the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society get all the attention, but it's people working much closer to home who are making a difference," said Press. "It's so dispersed that it's easily overlooked, but the total acreage they've saved is having major ecosystem impacts. It's really quite remarkable." The cumulative impact of local efforts add up to significant benefits in air and water quality and protection of wildlife corridors.</p>
<p>In his book, Press profiles the historical record of 80 years of land preservation efforts in 47 of California's 58 counties (federal ownership of large portions of the remaining 11 counties limit opportunities for local preservation). In compiling the county profiles, Press was struck by the variation in amounts of protected acreage: As a proportion of a county's area, local open space ranges from much less than 1 percent (Los Angeles) to more than 12 percent (Alameda); on a per capita basis, the range is from about zero acres per thousand residents (Madera) to about 200 acres per thousand residents (Humboldt, Marin). The more urbanized coastal counties of Santa Clara, Marin, Alameda, and Orange have the strongest track records of protecting open space near their big cities, while the inland northern counties of Sutter, Glenn, and Madera, with Kings County in central California, have the weakest records.</p>
<p>Five factors are present in local preservation efforts, according to Press:</p>

<ul>
<li>A compelling local landscape, whether foothills, forest, coastal, or desert <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>A politically engaged public that expects and demands open space <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Political entrepreneurship in the form of leaders who are willing to fundraise, network, and bring in the necessary outside legal and fiscal expertise to acquire land<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Fiscal resources<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Perception of runaway development</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Although the elements are the same, the balance varies from county to county, which affects the overall success of land preservation efforts, said Press. "Each county has the same toolkit, but they don't necessarily have the same size hammer," he said.</p>
<p>In researching Saving Open Space, Press conducted dozens of interviews with local planners, open space activists, elected officials, and park agency staff. He also surveyed 4,100 California residents by phone to assess their views about their local government, parks and open space, and their civic behavior. Finally, he combed through countless records to measure fiscal and administrative resources, environmental plicy support, local development pressure, and landscape features.</p>
<p>Land preservation efforts in other states will likely follow California's lead, said Press, who believes other highly discretionary local policy issues, including water conservation and waste management, could be shaped by local alliances in the absence of state and federal regulation.</p>
<p>"From a democratic perspective, it's desirable to have a lot of people involved and to foster local ownership of the process. After all, these are our landscapes," said Press. "What's not rational is to have the state and federal governments being obstructionist or minimally involved. Ideally, you'd give the locals more muscle with support from Sacramento and Washington, D.C."</p>

James M. Lawson Jr., a longtime crusader for civil rights and nonviolent solutions throughout the world, will be the keynote speaker at UCSC's annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation at 7 p.m. on January 21 at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. The event is free and open to the public.</p><p>Lawson worked in the 1950s and '60s with King in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Fellow civil rights activist and now U.S. Rep. John Lewis of Georgia has described Lawson as an architect of the nonviolent direct-action strategy of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. </p><p>"Jim Lawson knew.that we were being trained for a war unlike any this nation had seen up to that time, a nonviolent struggle that would force this country to face its conscience," Lewis wrote in his autobiography, Walking With the Wind. "Lawson was arming us, preparing us, planting in us a sense of rightness and righteousness," he added.</p><p>Lawson was president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, founded by King, for 14 years, and traveled to India to study Gandhi's techniques. </p><p>He was an activist from an early age, and by the time he was 20 his views on racial injustice and the Cold War had gotten him labeled a communist by his hometown newspaper in Massillon, Ohio. Lawson also served time in prison--a "prisoner of conscience"-- for not cooperating with the draft prior to the Korean War. </p><p>Over the years, Lawson has pushed a varied agenda, with a common theme of promoting peace and justice. In 1982, he organized a Peace Sunday event in Los Angeles that brought thousands of people to the Rose Bowl, and soon after addressed thousands of peace marchers in the streets of West Berlin. He has organized low-wage workers, supported the living-wage movement, served on the board of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, and spoken out against discrimination against gays and lesbians.</p><p>In 2000, Lawson traveled to Iraq with an interfaith delegation from the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a peace organization, to support the lifting of sanctions against that country. "I have long connected the sanctions against the Iraqi people with my discussions on nonviolence, on Dr. King, and on justice struggles in the United States," he said in an interview with Fellowship, a publication of the Fellowship of Reconciliation.</p><p>Now retired as pastor of the Holman United Methodist Church in Los Angeles, Lawson was the Luce Urban Lecturer at the Divinity School, Harvard University, in 2000-01, and taught a course on nonviolent struggle in the United States at UCLA in 2000. He plans to teach another UCLA course on nonviolence this  spring.</p><p>Lawson has also been a Regents' Lecturer at the University of California, Riverside; Brooks Professor of Religion at the University of Southern California; and Adjunct Professor at the School of Theology at Claremont College. For more than 10 years, Lawson hosted a weekly national cable television program, Lawson Live, on the Hallmark network, and plans to resume the program in the spring. </p><p>The 19th-annual convocation is presented by UCSC's Office of the Chancellor with coordination by the Martin Luther King Jr. Planning Committee and the University Events Office, and support from the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs; the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community; the Educational Opportunity Program, and the African American Student Life Center.

The program has proved so successful that it now receives funding from the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office. </p><p>	"I saw a missing link between incarcerated women and the resources that are available to support them when they get out," said Greene. "These women desperately want a better life for their children than they had, but they need help."</p><p>	Indeed, the cycle is repeated across generations, too; research shows that children of people who have been incarcerated are more likely to spend time in jail than their peers whose parents have not been jailed. Poverty and a high drop-out rate also persist from one generation to another.</p><p>	Greene's program helps incarcerated women anticipate their needs after release, from housing, employment, and bus fare to drug treatment programs and educational opportunities. "We try to get them to close their eyes and imagine themselves one year from now," explained Greene. "We ask them, 'You're not in jail, so where do you live, and what are you doing?' "</p><p>	For many, those questions are difficult to answer. Most women incarcerated in Santa Cruz County are what officials call the "chronically incarcerated," having been jailed an average of four times for violations such as illegal drug use or possession, property crimes like petty theft, forgery, or shoplifting, and minor probation violations. Typically poor and in their early 30s with two young children, most are high-school dropouts, and less than half have worked outside the home, according to Greene. Women of color are overrepresented. </p><p>	"For most of these women, their day-to-day life is a hustle. Survival is day to day," said Greene, who tapped UCSC undergraduate volunteers to help her reach out to inmates in the Women's Facility, known for years as "Blaine Street," where minimum-security inmates serve sentences of one year or less. </p><p>	Margaret Porter, the Sheriff Office's supervising correctional officer assigned to the Women's Facility, called Getting Out and Staying Out "a critical cog in this whole system."</p><p>	"They're here three nights a week," Porter said admiringly of the volunteers. "They're part of the process."</p><p>	Greene and her volunteers are skilled at helping women envision a future for themselves and mapping a step-by-step strategy for life outside. But Greene doesn't measure the success of Getting Out and Staying Out by standard measures of recidivism. These women are facing such daunting challenges that she measures the small victories, like helping a woman fill out a job or community college application, or the day Cynthia, a mother of two, told her, "You taught me to trust again." </p><p>	"Every life counts," said Greene. "If a woman at Blaine Street can articulate her goals, that moment counts."</p><p>	Greene first worked with inmates in Santa Cruz in 1995 as a volunteer with Friends Outside, a national organization that tries to meet the immediate needs of newly incarcerated inmates. Inspired by research conducted for her master's degree, she formed Getting Out and Staying Out in 1998. </p><p>	"There are so few people offering support that is consistent," said Greene. "I've always told the volunteers that the most important thing they can do is show up."</p><p>	Greene's dissertation research includes in-depth interviews with incarcerated women, including three women she followed for one year after their release. Chronic instability and traumatic childhood experiences underlie what Greene calls the "cycles of pain" in the lives of incarcerated women. As children, many witnessed domestic violence and experienced physical or sexual abuse. Repeating the behavior of adults in their lives, they turn at a young age to drugs and alcohol to numb the pain. </p><p>	"There was never any time for healing, and most never talked about what happened to them," said Greene. "They turn to self-medicating to ease the pain, until it eventually lands them in jail." The lucky ones get help, but many women, upon release, fall back into the cycle of drug use and petty crime. Although Greene and her organization are now inviting therapists to provide pro bono sessions to help women deal with their underlying pain, Getting Out and Staying Out focuses on immediate needs.</p><p>	"We're not in a position to treat their addictions, but we are helping them get a bus pass, find a job, and get a place to live," said Greene. </p><p>	Greene takes great pride in the fact that the Sheriff's Office has endorsed Getting Out and Staying Out, which recently merged with the Santa Cruz chapter of Friends Outside, and has expanded to serve male minimum-security inmates. The group receives some financial support from the Santa Cruz Commission for Prevention of Violence Against Women and the Community Foundation, and a twice-yearly annual campus clothing drive provides inmates with thrift-shop vouchers so they can shop for clothes upon release. </p><p>	"I wanted this organization to go on beyond me," said Greene, noting that support from the Sheriff's Office funded the hiring last year of UCSC graduate Jolene Forman to coordinate the program. </p><p>	As Greene turns her attention to writing her dissertation, she reflects on what she has learned. "Whether or not you believe these people deserve to be punished, we could be making society more dangerous by ignoring the profound needs of so many people," said Greene. "If people had more information about the realities of what goes on in people's lives before they're arrested, and the hardships that get passed on to their children, there might be more support for alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent offenders." </p><p>_____</p><p>For more information, call Jolene Forman at (831) 425-3434.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c8f388072704601a012ff76ea9262"><name>276</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz art exhibition to feature distinctive works by new faculty</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Sesnon Art Gallery</keywords><start-date>1042527600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz art...</display-name><path>/2003/01/276</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/01/276</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337967877</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337967877</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Sesnon Art Gallery at UC Santa Cruz will kick off the new year with Faculty Works: 2003, an exhibition featuring the distinctive work of three new members of the art faculty. This diverse show, running January 15 through February 15, will include contemporary photography, painting, and installation by Melissa Gwyn, Lewis Watts, and Elliot Anderson.</p><p>Melissa Gwyn employs an unusual approach in her paintings, which combine the thick paint of abstract expressionism with the delicate and intricate detail of Dutch 17th- century still lifes. She often begins by pouring puddles of paint onto wood panels and molding the paint with her fingers, scalpels, and tweezers. Eventually, in a labor-intensive process that calls for multiple layers of paint, organic shapes resembling flowers, fruit, and leaves begin to appear and multiply.</p><p>"In some of the paintings, the puddle forms do suggest imagery, much as Leonardo saw figures in clouds," Gwyn said. "It relates to 'decalcomania,' a surrealist game from the '40s where the aim was to find subject matter in chance forms."</p><p>Gwyn's oil-encrusted paintings often take years to dry. Artforum noted that her paintings "look like enlarged slides of microscopic organisms whose apparent simplicity is belied, under closer scrutiny, by their teeming busyness." In fact, Gwyn is heavily influenced by the molecular building blocks of science.</p><p>"Old science books used to be my models, but now I'm getting molecular models from the web," Gwyn noted. "All my science books are now in storage in New York, so I've gone from using children's science books to modern images of molecular structures."</p><p>Gwyn joined the UCSC Art Department in August after spending two years teaching painting at the San Francisco Art Institute. She received two grants from the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts in 2000 and has been reviewed in the New York Times and the Village Voice. This will be her first exhibition at UCSC.</p><p>The photographs of Lewis Watts reflect traces of experience that people leave in the environment they occupy, revealing their culture and history. His work is in the permanent collections of the Oakland Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Neuberger Museum of Art in New York, and the Studio Museum in Harlem.</p><p>"This is the first digital work I've shown," Watts noted. "It's a landscape show, although I don't consider myself a landscape photographer. I've been concentrating on African American people and environments."</p><p>Watts's photos are urban landscapes shot in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, and Richmond, California. He said his eye is drawn to certain objects in the environment and he then reacts aesthetically to them. Several of the photos feature tombstones and murals.</p><p>"I see tombstones and murals as ways that people mark their territory," Watts observed. "In one image, there is a coffee pot left by the tombstone. I thought that was interesting in that it reflected a cultural icon. I just responded to this object that comes from everyday life and I made assumptions about the person buried there."</p><p>Watts came to UCSC after teaching photography and visual studies at UC Berkeley for 25 years. He has also taught at UC Davis and worked as a photographer, archivist, and curator for such clients as Lucas Film Learning, the San Francisco Public Library, and KQED.</p><p>"I was trained as a social scientist and became an artist," Watts noted. "But my interest in history, culture, and identity really permeate my work."</p><p>The Sesnon exhibit will also feature an interactive video installation titled Don't Trip Over the Wire by Elliot Anderson, a lecturer at UCSC since 1997 who was recently appointed assistant professor in electronic media.</p><p>Wires will be strung across the floor of the gallery, which will contain three monitors containing looped videos of Anderson. Viewers will approach the monitors and be unable to avoid tripping the wires, which will trigger recorded voices of different language translations all warning "don't trip over the wire." The translations are all culled from online translators that ultimately distort the sentence as in the children's game of telephone.</p><p>"I wanted to make an interactive, theatrical, absurdist, obsessive piece," Anderson said. "I'm including the viewer in an absurd activity. The gallery floor will look like string art from the '60s. As people move, they will catch on the wires and it becomes a farce."</p><p>Anderson said the idea comes from the absurd logic of the computer.</p><p>"All my work is based on pathology and disease related to the computer," Anderson explained. "We rely on it so much, but it's repetitive, obsessive, and ultimately absurd. It's about how the computer structures our thinking--we're tangled up in it, but it doesn't translate into human emotion. It reduces life to data and numbers, and it paints an absurd picture of who you are."</p><p>Concurrently showing at the Porter College Faculty Gallery is Elizabeth Stephens's new interactive web-based art project, Wish You Were Here. Posing the question, "if someone were to take a road trip across the U.S., what would you have them do for you," she invites virtual travelers to make requests and records her journey on her web site: http//wishyouwerehere.ucsc.edu. An associate professor of art, Stephens has been teaching at UCSC since 1994.</p><p>_____</p><p>An opening reception will be held on January 15 from 5 to 6:30 p.m. Gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday from noon to 5 p.m. The web site is: <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu">arts.ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c90788072704601a012ff721afff4"><name>277</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>EDITOR'S ADVISORY: Policy brief outlines appeal of Islamic radicals</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Islamic radicalism, Alan Richards, A Political Economy of the Middle East, Iraq, war with Iraq</keywords><start-date>1042614000000</start-date><display-name>EDITOR'S ADVISORY: Policy brief...</display-name><path>/2003/01/277</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/01/277</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337968200</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337968200</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As the United States moves closer to war with Iraq, a leading scholar of the Middle East has published a compelling analysis of the conditions that have given rise to Islamic radicalism.

Author Alan Richards is a frequent consultant to the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense on Middle Eastern affairs. A professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Richards is coauthor of the book, <em>A Political Economy of the Middle East.</em> He can be reached at (831) 459-4662 or via e-mail sent to arr@ucsc.edu.<br/>
<br/>
<p>In the policy brief, Richards writes that a military attack on Iraq will stoke the "already intense rage against the U.S. felt by the political actors to whom the future belongs: young Muslims." Instead, he argues for short-term covert operations against al-Qaeda and long-run strategies to undermine the appeal of violent Islamist radicals. Richards identifies four roots of Islamic radicalism:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Destabilization.</strong> The Muslim world is in crisis as it moves from an illiterate, agrarian society into an industrialized society. Richards compares it to what unfolded in Europe, East Asia, and the United States during their own transitions, and he likens today's followers of al-Qaeda to utopian fanatics of the past, including fascists, Nazis, Leninists, and Maoists.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Demographics.</strong> Half of all Middle Easterners are below the age of 20, and, for the first time in history, many youth have received some education. But higher expectations are thwarted by a sluggish labor market and levels of unemployment in some countries that rival those of the United States during the worst days of the 1930s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Poverty and discontent.</strong> Only sketchy data on poverty in the Middle East are available, but many Middle Easterners feel relatively poor, an impression fueled by global images on television and the Internet. "Poverty provides a fertile recruiting ground for opponents of regimes," writes Richards, noting that the profile of the rank-and-file of today's violent radical Islamic groups is a young person with some education who may have recently moved to the city.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li><strong>Rapid urbanization and government failure.</strong> Middle Easterners have streamed into urban areas in the past 35 years, and the number of city residents is projected to rise from 135 million today to more than 350 million by 2025. But public services and infrastructure are overwhelmed. Government failure to provide basic services, including housing, sewerage, utilities, potable water, and garbage collection, strains their legitimacy. Recently arrived rural migrants to cities are prime targets of Islamic militants.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<p>Sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Center for Global, International &amp; Regional Studies (CGIRS), the new Global Policy Brief web site will showcase research and opinions on international matters of widespread interest, said Ben Crow, an associate professor of sociology at UCSC and the CGIRS associate director who launched the site. "We'd like to help narrow the gap between academics, policy makers, and the public," said Crow.</p>

Its premiere production earned seven awards from the Mexican Critics Association in 1994, including Best New Play of the Year, and the show was eventually made into an award-winning film.</p><p>Stage, screen, and television actress Alma Martinez, who joined the UCSC theater arts faculty in 2001 as an assistant professor, will direct this witty, provocative, and highly acclaimed work for a two-week run at the campus Mainstage Theater, February 20 through March 2.</p><p>"It's a contemporary, romantic, feminist comedy," Martinez observed. "The play is about gender issues and very Mexican. The reason I chose it was that it offers a different approach to understanding gender roles and feminist issues in Mexican culture."</p><p>The play centers around the relationship between Gina, a single widow with a son in college, and Alberto, a college professor who sees himself as a liberal, democratic activist. However, Alberto's politics are not represented in his personal life. In his relationship with Gina, he is sexist, self-centered, and not at all democratic.</p><p>"Gina is madly in lust with Alberto," explained Martinez. "She thinks she's in love, but the relationship is based purely on sex. As the play opens, Gina begins to want more from the relationship.things like marriage and children. But Alberto wants to keep the relationship as it is. He prefers to come and go as he pleases."</p><p>Alberto has been married twice and has four children. He is also a historian who is totally obsessed with Pancho Villa-he's writing a biography of the revolutionary hero who courageously fought for the working class. Scenes of Gina and Alberto's Mexico City relationship in 1998 overlap with scenes from Pancho Villa's revolutionary days in 1910, which are recalled as Gina types pages of Alberto's historical book.</p><p>"Pancho Villa had five wives and numerous children," Martinez noted. "Alberto is trying to emulate his politics but he also ends up emulating his personal relations with women.</p><p>"It's an allegory for the bigger issue of corruption in the Mexican government which is patriarchal, sexist, and not democratic," Martinez added. "The playwright equates democracy with femininity. Both women and men admire Pancho Villa because their lives are shaped by the history of their country. But according to the playwright, we have to look deeper and see what it really represents-the domination of women by this patriarchal system."</p><p>A professional actress for 25 years, Martinez was discovered by renowned writer/director Luis Valdez who cast her as the romantic lead in his Los Angeles hit play, Zoot Suit. She has appeared in a number of feature films including Under Fire opposite Gene Hackman and Nick Nolte, Barbarosa with Willie Nelson and Gary Busey; Zoot Suit with Edward James Olmos, and Cheech Marin's Born in East L.A.</p><p>On the stage, Martinez has performed with Academy Award-winner Dianne Wiest in In the Summer House at Lincoln Center and with Tony award-winning actress Nell Carter in Hello Dolly at the Long Beach Civic Light Opera. She recently appeared in the world premiere of Luis Valdez's Mummified Deer at the San Diego Repertory Theatre where she received a BackStage "Garland" Award for her performance.</p><p>Martinez's television career includes guest-star appearances on Nash Bridges, The Twilight Zone directed by Wes Craven, and General Hospital. She also costarred in several movies for television, working with Alec Baldwin, Bruce Dern, John Lithgow, Kate Jackson, and James Woods.</p><p>When she completes her doctorate, Martinez will hold the distinction of being the first Latina to graduate from the Stanford Drama Department in its 50-year history and only the second Chicana in the country to hold a Ph.D. in drama. She said she enjoys working in all forms of entertainment, but prefers theater the most.</p><p>"They say that theater is for the actor, film is for the director, and television is for the producer," she explained. "In film, the director calls the shots, in television, the producer pushes the buttons and edits. But theater is where the actors have the most freedom-it's more of an actor's medium. But it's always fun to do the others."</p><p>Now in her second year of teaching at UCSC, Martinez said she hopes to eventually offer courses in Chicano and Latin American popular political theater.</p><p>"As a theater arts professor, you stay connected and working," she said. "And I'm using the experience I have to get students excited about theater and working in the arts.</p><p>"Of utmost importance to me is pursuing diversity, but the best way to achieve this, from my perspective, is to expose our community to Chicano and Latino theater," she added. </p><p>"After all, by 2010, Chicanos and Latinos will be the majority population in the state of California."</p><p>Tickets for the play are available from the UCSC Ticket Office, (831) 459-2159.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c92da8072704601a012ff3f8c7ff5"><name>279</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scientists explain formation of stone circles and other strange patterns in northern regions by simple feedback mechanisms and self-organization</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>stone circles, Mark Kessler, Brad Werner</keywords><start-date>1042700400000</start-date><display-name>Scientists explain formation of...</display-name><path>/2003/01/279</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/01/279</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337968805</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337968805</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Perfect circles of stones cover the ground in parts of Alaska and the Norwegian islands of Spitsbergen. Elsewhere in the far north, stones form other striking patterns on the ground: polygons, stripes, islands, and labyrinths. No, pranksters are not at work in these remote areas, nor are aliens, elves, or any other outside forces moving the stones around. According to scientists who have studied the phenomenon, cyclic freezing and thawing of the ground drives simple feedback mechanisms that generate these remarkable patterns.</p><p>"The patterns form by self-organization, and the same fundamental processes are at work in the formation of all these different patterns," said Mark Kessler, a postdoctoral researcher in the Earth Sciences Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>As a graduate student working with Brad Werner, a professor of geophysics at UC San Diego, Kessler developed a numerical model of the processes involved in the self-organization of these patterns, known to geologists as "sorted patterned ground." Kessler and Werner reported their findings in a paper published in the January 17 issue of the journal <i>Science.</i> </p><p>Over the years, other scientists have proposed various explanations for these unusual patterns of stones and soil. But until now, no single explanation has been able to account for the full range of patterns seen in nature. </p><p>"The model I developed is essentially a hypothesis about what is important in the formation of patterned ground," Kessler said. "When you run the model on a computer, you can see the evolution of the pattern over time, and you can also see how small changes in key parameters result in a transition from one pattern to another." </p><p>According to Kessler, the patterns result primarily from the interaction of two mechanisms: lateral sorting, which moves soil toward areas of high soil concentration and stones toward areas of high stone concentration; and squeezing of stone domains, which causes stones to move within linear piles of stones and lengthens these lines of stones. The relative strengths of lateral sorting and squeezing, plus the slope of the ground and the ratio of stones to soil, are the factors that determine which pattern will emerge, Kessler said.</p><p>Driving the mechanisms of lateral sorting and squeezing is the phenomenon of frost heave--the expansion of fine-grained soils during freezing of wet ground. Frost heave results from the formation of discrete ice lenses in the soil. The soil near the surface expands because water flows up through the soil toward the ice lens as it forms (and to a lesser extent because the water expands as it freezes). </p><p>"If you start with a random layer of stones over a layer of soil, frost heave makes the soil layer unstable and deforms the interface between stones and soil," Kessler said.</p><p>As an ice lens grows near this interface, it pushes outward on the stones and also desiccates and compresses the soil below it. Where the interface between stones and soil is inclined, this causes lateral displacement of both stones and soil. When the ground thaws, the compressed soil reabsorbs water and expands. But the expansion occurs vertically, so it does not reverse the lateral displacement of soil by frost heave. Furthermore, the greater compressibility of soil-rich areas results in soil transport toward those areas. </p><p>Other processes are also involved in lateral sorting, but the end result is a positive feedback loop in which cycles of freezing and thawing cause soil-rich areas to attract more soil and stone-rich areas to attract more stones. </p><p>Once stones have been sorted into concentrated areas, or "stone domains," frost heave also squeezes and uplifts the stone domains. Differential uplift causes stones to migrate along the axis of a linear stone domain and lengthens the domain.  </p><p>"The pattern depends on the relative strengths of lateral sorting, which actually brings stones back into areas of high stone concentration, and squeezing, which moves stones along," Kessler said. "One of the real mysteries to me was how you can get labyrinths or islands of stones in one location and polygons in another, when the ratio of stones to soil is the same in both places. Our model indicates that you get polygons when the squeezing is strong enough to counteract the effects of lateral sorting."</p><p>There are a variety of factors that can lead to differences in the relative strengths of squeezing and lateral sorting, he said. These include the compressibility of the soil and the size of the stones.</p><p>Another important factor is the extent to which the stone domains are confined by the soil, which determines whether squeezing will mainly cause stones to move along the stone domains or roll back onto the soil domains. In their model, Kessler and Werner can vary the degree of confinement, the concentration of stones, and the slope of the ground to produce circles, labyrinths, islands, stripes, and polygons of stones. </p><p>The researchers compared the patterns generated by the model with those observed in nature, using low-elevation aerial photographs of polygon networks in Alaska. Quantitative measurements of the natural and computer-generated polygons showed they were consistent. For example, one of the interesting features of polygon patterns, both in the model and in nature, is the tendency to form three-way intersections with equal angles between the intersecting lines, Kessler said. </p><p>One reason these patterns have remained unexplained for so long may be their occurence in remote areas, far from the temperate zone where most scientists live, Kessler said. "If these patterns were on the ground around here, I think we would have figured them out a long time ago. These landscapes are so amazing, it's the kind of thing that really calls out for an explanation."</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Kessler at (831) 459-5143 or mkessler@es.ucsc.edu.</p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/</a>. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c940e8072704601a012fff883e4a4"><name>280</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz prof named American Psychological Association fellow</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Margarita Azmitia, psychology,American Psychological Association, (APA)</keywords><start-date>1043650800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz prof...</display-name><path>/2003/01/280</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/01/280</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337969097</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337969097</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Margarita Azmitia, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been honored by her peers who have elected her a fellow of the American Psychological Association (APA).</p><p>	APA fellows are selected for their "exceptional and outstanding contributions to the research, teaching, or practice of psychology" and are recognized for the national impact of their work.</p><p>	Azmitia is a developmental psychologist whose research addresses three areas.

The selection process to identify the partners is underway and results are expected in March, she added.</p><p>	Based at UC Santa Cruz, the NTC is a leading force behind the development of high-quality teacher and administrator induction programs nationally. The center advocates for a mentor-based induction program developed by the Santa Cruz New Teacher Project, which has provided support to more than 9,000 new teachers in California. </p><p>		The NTC model taps the expertise of exemplary veteran teachers who are released full time from classroom duties and trained to mentor novice teachers. The model requires strong institutional commitment from school districts, noted Moir.</p><p>		"Research shows that districts that invest in high-quality support programs for new teachers have higher teacher retention rates, and we know that high-quality teachers is the single most important factor in student achievement," said Moir. </p><p>	The Carnegie Corporation grant will facilitate coordination between the selected institutions preparing the next generation of teachers and local school districts. The three-year effort will implement the NTC model in participating schools so that preservice programs at the university level are aligned with district programs.</p><p>	The center will link the partners and provide the foundation for coordination, train new teacher mentors, provide ongoing coaching for mentors, and collect data to document the effects of the project.</p><p>	"By collaborating across institutional boundaries, we are able to span the continuum of teacher development," said Moir. "The goal is to improve teacher development, teacher retention, and student achievement." </p><p>	The project is linked to the Carnegie Corporation's high-profile Teachers for a New Era program, an ambitious reform initiative geared toward revitalizing and radically revising teacher preservice programs across the country.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c97d68072704601a012ffa189f9ed"><name>283</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New health sciences major at UC Santa Cruz includes community service and Spanish language requirements</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>new health sciences major</keywords><start-date>1043650800000</start-date><display-name>New health sciences major...</display-name><path>/2003/01/283</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/01/283</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337970059</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337970059</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, has established a new health sciences major designed for students interested in medical careers. Students majoring in health sciences at UCSC will be required to become proficient in Spanish and to do an internship in a community health care setting, in addition to taking the usual science courses required for admission to medical school.  </p><p>The Spanish language and internship requirements make the program unique in the UC system, said Charlotte Moreno, assistant dean of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. </p><p>"The program was designed with these components in order to better meet emerging needs within the health care industry and to better serve the increasingly diverse population of the state of California," she said. </p><p>The new major's community service requirement essentially formalizes what has become an informal requirement for admission to many medical schools, said John Tamkun, professor and chair of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology.</p><p>"A lot of medical schools want students to have some experience working in a health care setting. They want to be sure the students know what they're getting into," Tamkun said.</p><p>In the past, premed students at UCSC have had to seek out such opportunities on their own. Now, the campus is hiring an internship coordinator for the health sciences program who will identify good opportunities for students to work with health care professionals in the local community. Students will also be able to receive academic credit for the internships. </p><p>"The internships will really help our students when they apply to medical school," Tamkun said.</p><p>The Spanish language requirement was inspired by conversations with various health care professionals, said Lindsay Hinck, an assistant professor of MCD biology who worked with Tamkun, Moreno, and others to design the new major.</p><p>"What I heard from a lot of doctors is that, in the end, medical school teaches you all the science you need, but when you get out into the real world you find that you really need language skills," Hinck said.</p><p>An article in the January issue of the journal Pediatrics highlighted the difficulties facing Spanish-speaking patients. The study found that errors in interpretation were common during visits to a pediatric clinic when a Spanish interpreter was used. In 13 monitored visits, the researchers recorded an average of 31 errors per visit, most of which had potential clinical consequences. Errors were most common when ad hoc interpreters, such as family members or untrained bilingual hospital workers, were used.</p><p>UCSC's health sciences major requires four quarters of Spanish, plus a new course in medical Spanish designed to teach not only medical terminology but also relevant cultural considerations. Spanish lecturer Brenda Barcelo, who is teaching the course for the first time this quarter, said she was surprised by the level of interest in the new course.</p><p>"The class includes native speakers of Spanish, which was very unexpected, and I also have students who have already taken the regular Spanish 5 course and are taking this one even though they may not get credit for it," Barcelo said. </p><p>Students may begin enrolling in the new major in fall 2003. The Departments of MCD Biology and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology will jointly administer the program, which will lead to a bachelor of science (B.S.) degree.</p><p>Tamkun said the health sciences major will complement the health-related research programs at UCSC. "We do a lot of biomedical research here that is funded by the National Institutes of Health, and we look forward to further growth in this area, so it makes sense to have an undergraduate program in health sciences," he said.</p><p>The health sciences major marks the first step in a broad health sciences initiative at UCSC that will eventually include an array of programs for students interested in different aspects of human health and health-care issues. </p><p>"There is a lot of interest across campus in developing more opportunities for students who are interested in health-related careers," Tamkun said. </p><p>"We are very excited about this new program," Moreno added. "We expect that it will be one component of what is envisioned as a broad-based, interdisciplinary set of campus programs that will offer options for students interested in health sciences, health care delivery, and health care policy issues."</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Hinck at (831) 459-5253 or hinck@biology.ucsc.edu and Tamkun at (831) 459-3179 or tamkun@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c98f68072704601a012ff5946e69c"><name>284</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Acclaimed author/journalist to speak at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Barbara Ehrenreich</keywords><start-date>1043305200000</start-date><display-name>Acclaimed author/journalist to speak...</display-name><path>/2003/01/284</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/01/284</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337970374</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337970374</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Award-winning author and journalist Barbara Ehrenreich will present a free public lecture, Thursday, February 13, at 4 p.m. in Kresge Town Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus. Ehrenreich will address themes raised in her recent best-selling book, <i>Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America.</i> She is the first distinguished visitor to be sponsored by the new Institute for Advanced Feminist Research at UCSC.</p><p>Ehrenreich has been a contributing writer for Time Magazine since 1990. Her work has appeared in a wide range of national publications, including the New York Times Magazine, the Washington Post Magazine, Ms., Esquire, Atlantic Monthly, Harper's, the Nation, the New Republic, Social Policy, and Mirabella, as well as a variety of newspapers throughout the world.</p><p>Between 1998 and 2000, Ehrenreich traveled to three different American cities and attempted to support herself on the wages of entry-level jobs. She waited tables, fed Alzheimer's patients at a nursing home, cleaned the toilets of the rich, and worked as a stocker at Wal-Mart. Her original idea was to write a magazine article about whether she could survive alone on those wages. Instead, she wrote Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America, a powerful, insightful book that garnered a great deal of media attention.</p><p>A chapter of the book appeared in Harper's magazine and received the Sydney Hillman Award for Journalism and a Brill's Content "Honorable Mention." Another essay, "Maid To Order," which evolved out of her research for the book, was published in Harper's the following year, and it generated so many letters that the magazine created a special section just to accommodate them. </p><p>"I think her book, Nickel and Dimed, has really raised consciousness about what it means to be in the ranks of the working poor in this nation," observed Helene Moglen,  professor of literature at UC Santa Cruz. "The issues that she raises in her book only become more timely every day, as more and more people join the ranks of the working poor and unemployed." </p><p>A prolific social critic, Ehrenreich has written numerous books over the past two decades about welfare, war, class, and women's health. Her work is widely lauded for its unrelenting commitment to feminism and social change. She concludes Nickel and Dimed by stating:</p><p>	The 'working poor' as they are approvingly termed, are in fact the major philanthropists of our society. They neglect their own children so that the children of others will be cared for; they live in substandard housing so that other homes will be shiny and perfect; they endure privation so that inflation will be low and stock prices high. To be a member of the working poor is to be an anonymous donor, a nameless benefactor, to everyone else.</p><p>"I think what Ehrenreich is trying to do is bring to the privileged classes some understanding about what their privilege rests upon," Moglen said. "She's a researcher, an intellectual, an activist--someone who is really working for social change. And that's enormously important." </p><p>In a recent interview, Ehrenreich noted how Nickel and Dimed has affected her life since its publication in 2002.</p><p>"It certainly influences my agenda as a writer and as, in some small scale, an activist," she said. "You have to come out of these situations and say the only way to justify going back into a middle-class style.well, I say justify, but I was desperate to go back to middle-class life.is to ask: 'what am I doing for change, what am I doing to make this a less brutally, unequal society?" </p><p>_____</p><p>Barbara Ehrenreich will also present a seminar on Friday, February 14, at 10 a.m. in the Cowell Conference Room on the UC Santa Cruz campus. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c9b328072704601a012ff339e9e6b"><name>286</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New restaurant coming soon to Quarry Plaza at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Louise Donahue (831) 459-5312; ldonahue@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Quarry Plaza, Joe's Pizza and Subs</keywords><start-date>1043737200000</start-date><display-name>New restaurant coming soon...</display-name><path>/2003/01/286</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/01/286</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337970947</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337970947</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The search for a new restaurant for Quarry Plaza at UC Santa Cruz is over, and the winner is Joe's Pizza and Subs.</p><p>Owner Joe Hammana plans to open his UCSC operation within a month. The eclectic menu will range from pizza and hamburgers to vegan dishes and Middle Eastern specialties-and Hammana promises a few surprises, as well.</p><p>The new restaurant will also be called Joe's Pizza and Subs, and will include a vegan menu, as well as more than 50 kinds of New York-style sub sandwiches and daily specials.</p><p>Hammana's ability to suit widely varying tastes was a major selling point for Joe's. An online survey this past fall revealed often-conflicting preferences: some wanted fast food, others wanted a vegan or vegetarian restaurant, while still others favored Asian or other ethnic food. </p><p>"I believe he'll be a great fit for the campus," said Ruth Schmitz, a graduate student and a member of the search committee that unanimously chose Joe's. The restaurant takes the place of the Whole Earth, which closed in the summer of 2002 due to financial difficulties. </p><p>"He makes the absolute best vegan pizza I've ever had in my life," said Schmitz. She was initially concerned that Joe's might be too mainstream, but changed her mind after the committee visited Joe's, at 736 Water Street in Santa Cruz.</p><p>Reasonable prices, a customer-oriented approach, and financial stability were other considerations for the committee, Schmitz said. Committee members included undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, staff, and administrative representatives. The restaurant is part of the Graduate Student Commons.</p><p>Known by customers for his personal touch, Hammana said "the smile is always there" and that he does whatever he can to keep customers happy. He and his wife, Georgette, who creates many of the recipes at Joe's, will continue to operate the Water Street restaurant. </p><p>Hammana has many student customers at his current location, and anticipates no problem satisfying student tastes. "Anyone who comes in here, he's hooked," Hammana said. He joked that students may miss their parents' love while away at college, but if they eat at Joe's, they won't miss their parents' cooking. </p><p>The Hammanas have plenty of experience in the business. They have been at the Water Street location since 1986, and worked in the Hammana family restaurant in Beirut, Lebanon, before moving to the United States. </p><p>For more information, please contact Diane Brookes, Graduate Student Commons building Manager, at 459-1395.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c9c658072704601a012ff876ecdcf"><name>287</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>EDITOR'S ADVISORY: Parents may inhibit girls' interest and performance in science, study says</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@cats.ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Harriet R.

Is it the same in every culture? Has it changed over time? </p><p>The UC Santa Cruz Center for Cultural Studies will present "Desire: Past, Present, Future," a two-day conference, February 21-22, at the UCSC campus, to explore these questions and discuss scholarly work that utilizes the concept of desire as a springboard to examine a variety of cultural ideas. The event is free and open to the public.</p><p>The conference will kick off Friday evening with a keynote address by Northwestern professor of radio/TV/film, Laura Kipnis, followed by a screening of Pedro Almodovar's film, All About My Mother. The speakers on Saturday will include Leo Bersani, emeritus professor of French at UC Berkeley; David Roman, associate professor of English and American studies at USC; Anne Anlin Cheng, associate professor of English and American literature at UC Berkeley; and Chris Coffman, visiting assistant professor of literature at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>Kipnis's talk will question the prevailing wisdom in this country that while sexual desire is usually acknowledged to be a relatively short-lived phenomenon, "mature love" takes its place when desire fades. In a recent article in the New York Times Magazine, she observed, "The issue that remains unaddressed is whether cutting off other possibilities of romance and sexual attraction for the more muted pleasures of mature love isn't similar to voluntarily amputating a healthy limb."</p><p>	Kipnis argues that since love has such vast power over our thoughts and decisions, saying no to desire "is a tragedy.the failure to achieve what is most essentially human."</p><p>Carla Freccero, UCSC professor of literature and co-coordinator of the research group that organized the conference, noted that our notion of romantic love is a relatively recent historical idea.</p><p>	"Certainly before the 20th century, people thought romantic love and marriage lived in two different places," she said. "Monogamy and romantic love are incompatible, but they're not supposed to be.
